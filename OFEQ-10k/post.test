i 'm interested to know if anyone can give me some information -LRB- name , references , etc. -RRB- about this pde <m> | \nabla \omega | ^ 2 = \alpha \omega ^ n + \beta , </m> where <m> \omega </m> is a scalar function of two or more variables , <m> \alpha </m> and <m> \beta </m> are arbitrary constants <m> \in </m> <m> \mathbb { R } </m> .
is there anything known about uniqueness of classical solutions to <m> \partial _ t u - u \Delta u = 0 \quad u ( 0 , \cdot ) = 1 </m> on smooth domains <m> [ 0 , T ] \times D </m> without boundary conditions ? i know that <m> u ( 0 , \cdot ) = 0 </m> implies that <m> u = 0 </m> even without boundary conditions . however , does <m> u ( 0 , \cdot ) = 1 </m> imply that <m> u = 1 </m> ? it is not so hard to see that <m> \partial _ t ^ k u ( 0 ) = 0 </m> for all <m> k \in \mathbb { N } </m> if <m> u </m> is smooth . hence , for an analytic in time solution , this must be true .
i am reading the draft of `` equations of riemann surfaces of genus 4 , 5 and 6 wih large automorphism groups '' and the author starts using the notation <m> H ^ 0 ( C , m K ) </m> on page 3 , without explaining it . as the author is studying the action of the automorphism group of <m> C </m> on <m> H ^ 0 ( C , m K ) </m> and refers to farkas who studies the action of the automorphism group of <m> C </m> on holomorphic q-differentials , i suspect that <m> H ^ 0 ( C , m K ) </m> is the first cohomology group computed using q-differentials , but i 'm not sure . my question is that if my guess is correct , then how does one even define that cohomology -LRB- do we still have <m> d ^ m d z ^ m = 0 </m> so we have our exact sequence to define the cohomology ? -RRB- . and if i 'm totally wrong then please tell me what that notation means . in any case i would appreciate if someone guides me to a reference so i can read more on this object .
we know the fact that <m> K _ 0 ( - ) </m> and <m> K _ 1 ( - ) </m> are continuous under inductive sequence of <m> C ^ * </m> - algebras -LRB- in fact inductive system -RRB- , i.e. <m> K _ 0 ( \varinjlim A _ n ) = \varinjlim K _ 0 ( A _ n ) </m> similar for <m> K _ 1 ( - ) </m> . in fact it is also true that <m> M _ k ( \lim _ { \rightarrow } A _ n ) = \varinjlim M _ k ( A _ n ) </m> for <m> k \in \mathbb N </m> . q1 : does <m> \widetilde { ( \varinjlim A _ n ) } </m> coincide with <m> \varinjlim \tilde { ( A _ n ) } </m> ? in fact this is a claim in someone 's book , but without a proof . if we let <m> ( X , \lambda _ n ) </m> be the inductive limit of <m> \tilde { A _ 1 } \rightarrow \tilde { A _ 2 } \rightarrow ~ \cdots </m> , then by universal property we get a unique morphism <m> \lambda : X \rightarrow \widetilde { \varinjlim A _ n } </m> . how can we show <m> \lambda </m> is injective ? nb morphisms need not be unital , even though <m> C ^ * </m> - algebras are unital . q2 : can we find any other continuous functors ? what about the universal group <m> C ^ { \star } </m> - algebras , tensor product of <m> C ^ { \star } </m> - algebras , cross product of <m> C ^ { \star } </m> - algebras and so on ? q3 : do we know any functor which is not continuous ?
is the following conjecture correct ? conjecture . the divisibility condition <m> ( \alpha + \beta ) ^ 2 \mid ( 2 \beta ^ 3 + 6 \alpha \beta ^ 2 - 1 ) </m> has no solutions in positive integers <m> 1 \le \beta < \alpha < 2 \beta </m> . this question is related to finding integer points on a mordell curve . a computer search outside the range indicated turned up the expected single solution <m> ( a , b ) = ( 4 , 1 ) </m> -LSB- corresponding to the single integer point on the original mordell curve -RSB- , as well as an unexpected solution <m> ( \alpha , \beta ) = ( 1 1 3 6 4 , 4 6 0 6 1 ) </m> , which i ca n't explain . any insights would be appreciated . i believe a method of solution -- particularly by descent -- to this special case would be immediately applicable to a large class of elliptic curves . fwiw , i 've developed a partial proof which i include below . the vieta jump implies that , for any solution <m> ( a , b ) </m> , there is a rational solution <m> ( b , \tfrac { 6 b ^ 2 } { k } - 2 b - a ) </m> with the same <m> k </m> ; in the case of the one known solution <m> ( a , b ) = ( 4 , 1 ) </m> , we do have <m> k = 1 </m> in the original equation <m> ( 5 b - a + 1 ) ( a + b ) ^ 2 = 2 ( 2 b ^ 3 + 6 a b ^ 2 - 1 ) , </m> which makes the second vieta root degenerate at <m> ( 1 , 0 ) </m> .
i 've been doing some basic reading in inner model theory , and i 'm at the point where i 've seen the definition of things like martin-steel and mitchell-steel inner models . i am wondering about the motivation for these constructions since they are much more complicated than the constructible universe <m> L </m> , or models like <m> L [ X ] </m> built by adding a predicate to the construction of <m> L </m> . i am wondering , what makes a naive approach like taking <m> L [ X ] </m> for the right sets fail for larger cardinals ? are there some results that pinpoint at what large cardinal strength more complicated constructions than <m> L [ X ] </m> are needed ? thank you .
what are the current best asymptotic bounds on <m> \pi ^ { - 1 } ( x ) </m> , where <m> \pi ( x ) </m> denotes the prime counting function -LRB- number of primes at most <m> x </m> -RRB- ? in other words , i am curious about the state of the art for estimating the <m> n ^ { t h } </m> prime . from the prime number theorem , it seems clear that <m> \pi ^ { - 1 } ( x ) = \Theta ( x \log x ) </m> . can someone point me in the direction of literature that answers the question ? please excuse my inability to find such literature myself ...

the question is related to this one . let <m> k </m> be a field and <m> X </m> be a topological space . we consider sh <m> ( X ) </m> , the category of sheaves of <m> k </m> - vector spaces on <m> X </m> . let <m> G </m> be a topological group which act on <m> X </m> continuously from the left . consider the simplicial space <m> [ G \backslash X ] _ { \cdot } </m> where <m> [ G \backslash X ] _ n = \underbrace { G \times \ldots \times G } _ { n \text { c o p i e s o f } G \text { ' s } } \times X </m> with structural maps <m> d _ 0 ( g _ 1 , \ldots , g _ n , x ) = ( g _ 2 , \ldots , g _ n , g _ 1 ^ { - 1 } x ) ; </m> <m> d _ i ( g _ 1 , \ldots , g _ n , x ) = ( g _ 1 , \ldots , g _ i g _ { i + 1 } , \ldots , g _ n , x ) , ~ 1 \leq i \leq n - 1 ; </m> <m> d _ n ( g _ 1 , \ldots , g _ n , x ) = ( g _ 1 , \ldots , g _ { n - 1 } , x ) ; </m> and <m> s _ 0 ( g _ 1 , \ldots , g _ n , x ) = ( e , g _ 1 , \ldots , g _ n , x ) ; </m> <m> s _ i ( g _ 1 , \ldots , g _ n , x ) = ( g _ 1 , \ldots , g _ i , e , g _ { i + 1 } , \ldots , g _ n x ) , ~ 1 \leq i \leq n - 1 ; </m> <m> s _ n ( g _ 1 , \ldots , g _ n , x ) = ( g _ 1 , \ldots , g _ n , e , x ) . </m> a <m> G </m> - equivariant sheaf on <m> X </m> is a pair <m> ( \mathcal { F } , \theta ) </m> , where <m> \mathcal { F } \in \text { S h } ( X ) </m> and <m> \theta </m> is an isomorphism <m> \theta : d _ 0 ^ * \mathcal { F } \overset { \sim } { \to } d _ 1 ^ * \mathcal { F } , </m> satisfying the cocycle condition <m> d _ 2 ^ * \theta \circ d _ 0 ^ * \theta = d _ 1 ^ * \theta , \text { a n d } s _ 0 ^ * \theta = \text { i d } _ { \mathcal { F } } . </m> a morphism <m> \phi : ( \mathcal { F } , \theta ) \to ( \mathcal { G } , \xi ) </m> is a sheaf morphism <m> \phi : \mathcal { F } \to \mathcal { G } </m> that commute with <m> \theta </m> and <m> \xi </m> . we denote the category of <m> G </m> - equivariant sheaves on <m> X </m> by <m> \text { S h } _ G ( X ) </m> . it is clear that <m> \text { S h } _ G ( X ) </m> is an abelian category and the forgetful functor for <m> : \text { S h } _ G ( X ) \to \text { S h } ( X ) </m> is exact . an equivariant sheaf <m> ( \mathcal { I } , \eta ) </m> is called injective if for any monomorphsim of equivariant sheaves <m> \phi : ( \mathcal { F } , \theta ) \to ( \mathcal { G } , \xi ) </m> and any morphism of equivariant sheaves <m> \psi : ( \mathcal { F } , \theta ) \to ( \mathcal { I } , \eta ) </m> , <m> \psi </m> could be extended to a morphism <m> \chi : ( \mathcal { G } , \xi ) \to ( \mathcal { I } , \eta ) </m> such that <m> \chi \circ \phi = \psi </m> .
browsing through oesis i have found that if <m> p _ p ( n ) </m> denotes the number of partitions of <m> n </m> into prime parts then <m> p _ p ( n ) = O ( e ^ { \frac { 2 \Pi } { \sqrt { 3 } } \sqrt { n / \log n } } ) </m> . i am interested in the asymptotic behaviour of a more specific function - <m> p ( n , k ) </m> defined as the number of partitions of <m> n </m> into <m> k </m> parts such that every part is an odd prime . -LRB- for example one such partition of 13 would be 7 +3 +3 -RRB- is there any known literature for looking up such identities ? or perhaps , is there an easy way to derive an asymptotic bound for <m> p ( n , k ) </m> ?

my qeustion is that , is there any theorem like implicit function theorem in <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> ? more precisely , let <m> p ( \bar { x } , \bar { y } ) </m> be in <m> \mathbb { Z } [ \bar { x } , \bar { y } ] </m> such that in <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> , for any <m> \bar { a } </m> , there is a solution of <m> p ( \bar { x } , \bar { a } ) </m> . then for some polynomial -LRB- or rational polynomial -RRB- <m> q ( \bar { y } ) </m> with <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> coefficients , <m> p ( q ( \bar { y } ) , \bar { y } ) = 0 </m> holds in the rational polynomial fields over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> . for example , <m> x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 = 1 </m> does not satisfy the condition but for <m> x + y = 0 </m> it holds . and how about the same question in p-adic field <m> \mathbb { Q } _ { p } </m> ?
i would like to know whether the following metatheorem on nonabelian <m> H ^ 2 </m> has been ever stated and/or proved . let <m> k </m> be a perfect field and <m> k ^ s </m> its fixed separable closure . let <m> X ^ s </m> be a variety with additional structure over <m> k ^ s </m> -LRB- i do n't want to specify what i mean by additional structure -RRB- . by a <m> k </m> - model of <m> X ^ s </m> i mean a variety with additional structure <m> X </m> over <m> k </m> together with a <m> k ^ s </m> - isomorphism <m> X \times _ k k ^ s \overset { \sim } { \to } X ^ s . </m>

i 'm working on some research involving supermatrices , and i was wondering if there was a <m> \mathbb { Z } _ 2 </m> graded analog of row operations for supermatrices . it seems to me that it makes sense to have row operations among the first <m> p </m> even rows and the last <m> q </m> odd rows in a <m> ( p \mid q ) \times ( r \mid s ) </m> supermatrix , however a row operation from an even row to an odd row is either undefined or requires a trick of some sort -LRB- possibly a parity transpose -RRB- ? any help would be appreciated , references to literature would be excellent .
let <m> k </m> be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero . let <m> A </m> be the <m> \mathbf { Z } </m> - subalgebra of the grothendieck ring of <m> k </m> - varieties <m> K _ 0 ( \text { V a r } _ k ) </m> generated by classes of semi-abelian varieties . question 1 . what can we say about the ring homomorphism <m> A \to K _ 0 ( \text { V a r } _ k ) </m> ? it is obviously very far from being surjective . mainly , is it integral/finite/flat / essentially of finite type ? question 2 . the class of smooth projective varieties over <m> k </m> generates <m> K _ 0 ( \text { V a r } _ k ) </m> in the obvious sense . is there a more manageable generating class of <m> k </m> - varieties , possibly containing semi-abelian varieties at the very least ? question 3 . in light of question 2 , does the class <m> \mathcal { P } </m> of varieties over <m> k </m> , constructed below , have any hope to be a generating class for <m> K _ 0 ( \text { V a r } _ k ) </m> , and if not , upon calling <m> B </m> the <m> \mathbf { Z } </m> - subalgebra of <m> K _ 0 ( \text { V a r } _ k ) </m> it generates , same question as in question 1 , for the ring homomorphism <m> B \to K _ 0 ( \text { V a r } _ k ) </m> . we call <m> \mathcal { P } _ 0 </m> the class of <m> k </m> - varieties whose objects are :

iwaniec , using the linear sieve , proved that <m> n ^ 2 + 1 </m> can be a product of at most two primes infinitely often and furthermore a lower bound of the correct order of magnitude for the number of such integers <m> n </m> is an expanded interval can be given . my question is if there is a -LRB- possibly different -RRB- sieve that allows one to obtain an asymptotic in the case that a larger number of primes is allowed ; i.e. letting <m> \omega </m> stand for the number of prime factors and <m> N _ r ( x ) : = \sharp \{ n \leq x : \omega ( n ^ 2 + 1 ) \leq r \} </m> then is there a large but fixed value of <m> r </m> such that one can prove an asymptotic for the quantity <m> N _ r ( x ) </m> ? i suspect that even correct upper bounds will be hard owing to parity issues but one can always hope .
about 2 weeks ago , i posted a question about irreducibility of a scheme over a completed local ring , on whether this is a continuous property or a limit property . i did n't succeed in answering it , but i got a bit more elementary question . i guess it should have been known already , as this is a basic question , but i had difficulties in locating a good reference . so , let me ask . -LSB- the question was corrected a bit reflecting comments . -RSB- to motivate , suppose <m> k </m> is a field of characteristic <m> 0 </m> -LRB- or something more general -RRB- . let <m> y _ 1 , y _ 2 , y _ 3 </m> be variables , and for nonzero constants <m> a _ 1 , \cdots , a _ 4 \in k </m> , consider the equation <m> V _ { \alpha _ 0 } : a _ 1 y _ 1 + a _ 2 y _ 1 y _ 2 + a _ 3 y _ 1 y _ 3 ^ 2 + a _ 4 = 0 . </m> the shape of the equation does not matter , but it is a finite linear combination of monomials in <m> y _ i </m> . roughly put , the question is : suppose the affine <m> k </m> - scheme <m> V _ { \alpha _ 0 } </m> is integral . if we take `` small changes '' of <m> a _ i </m> to obtain a new affine scheme <m> V _ { \alpha } </m> , then is <m> V _ { \alpha } </m> at least irreducible ? here , it is important that we do not turn a `` monomial '' with <m> 0 </m> coefficient into something nonzero , i.e. we modify only the coefficients that are nonzero . i tried to reformulate the question as follows : replace the nonzero constants <m> a _ 1 , \cdots , a _ 4 </m> by variables <m> x _ 1 , \cdots , x _ 4 </m> , and consider the general equation <m> V : x _ 1 y _ 1 + x _ 2 y _ 1 y _ 2 + x _ 3 y _ 1 y _ 3 ^ 2 + x _ 4 = 0 </m> in <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 4 \times \mathbb { A } ^ 3 </m> -LRB- with <m> ( x _ 1 , \cdots , x _ 4 , y _ 1 , y _ 2 , y _ 3 ) </m> as the coordinates -RRB- . consider the projection <m> p r _ 1 : V \to \mathbb { A } ^ 4 </m> to the <m> x </m> - coordinates , and we are given that for <m> \alpha _ 0 = ( a _ 1 , \cdots , a _ 4 ) \in \mathbb { A } ^ 4 </m> , the fiber <m> V _ { \alpha _ 0 } = p r ^ { - 1 } ( \alpha _ 0 ) </m> is integral . then i ask whether one can find an open neighborhood <m> U \subset \mathbb { A } ^ 4 </m> of <m> \alpha _ 0 </m> such that for each <m> \alpha \in U </m> , the fiber <m> V _ { \alpha } = p r ^ { - 1 } ( \alpha ) </m> is irreducible . any suggestions or ideas or discussions would be appreciated . the situation i 'm eventually interested in is the case when i 'm given a system of algebraic equations , for which a similar question can be formulated .
it is well known -LRB- e.g. , reference for `` lax monoidal functors '' = `` monoids under day convolution '' -RRB- that if <m> \mathcal C </m> is a monoidal <m> \mathcal V </m> - enriched category , then a monoid in <m> [ \mathcal C , \mathcal V ] </m> is the same thing as a lax monoidal functor <m> \mathcal C \to \mathcal V </m> , where <m> [ \mathcal C , \mathcal V ] </m> carries the monoidal structure given by the day convolution . is the following also true ?

for each <m> f \in C ^ \infty ( \mathbb R ^ n ) </m> , there exists <m> u \in C ^ \infty ( \mathbb R ^ n ) </m> such that <m> \Delta u = f </m> . this , i guess , has been known well before the more general malgrange-ehrenpreis theorem that says the same for a general differential operator with constant coefficients . my question is twofold : 1 ° -RRB- who proved this first ? 2 ° -RRB- does there exist a continuous operator <m> S : C ^ \infty ( \mathbb R ^ n ) \to C ^ \infty ( \mathbb R ^ n ) </m> such that <m> \Delta S f \equiv f </m> ?

who invented projective space <m> \mathbb { P } ^ n </m> as an extension of the usual affine space <m> \mathbb { A } ^ n </m> ? who was the first person to consider projective closure of plane affine algebraic curves -LRB- curves in <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 2 </m> -RRB- ? was it the same person ?
here 's the limit . <m> \lim _ { n \to \infty } - \frac { 4 z } { 1 + 4 z ^ 2 } n + \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ n \sqrt \frac { n } { j } \sin ( z \log { \frac { n } { j } } ) </m> can we prove that this does n't converge for any <m> z </m> where <m> \Im ( z ) \ne 0 </m> ?
hi there ! let <m> X </m> be a left <m> G </m> - set , and <m> \Delta = </m> -LCB- <m> x _ 1 , \ldots , x _ n </m> -RCB- a fundamental domain of <m> G </m> in <m> X </m> . in other words , <m> G </m> acts on <m> X </m> from the left , and -LCB- <m> G x _ 1 , \ldots , G x _ n </m> -RCB- is the orbit space <m> X / G </m> . let us call <m> H _ i </m> the stabilizer of <m> x _ i </m> , for all <m> i = 1 , 2 , \ldots , n </m> . then the set <m> G / { H _ i } </m> of left <m> H _ i </m> - cosets is the orbit <m> G x _ i </m> ; according , the union <m> T ( H _ 1 , \ldots , H _ n ) : = \bigcup _ { i = 1 } ^ n G / { H _ i } </m> is another way to write down <m> X </m> as the union of the <m> G </m> - orbits . somebody calls <m> T ( H _ 1 , \ldots , H _ n ) </m> a coset geometry of rank <m> n </m> , or a tits-buekenhout geometry ; interestingly enough , <m> T ( H _ 1 , \ldots , H _ n ) </m> is a natural left <m> G </m> - set , and its identification with <m> X </m> is a <m> G </m> - set morphism . this line of thoughts looks so obvious that i can not spot any mistake , so i 'm asking : is it true that any <m> G </m> - set with <m> n </m> orbits is a rank - <m> n </m> coset geometry -LRB- in the sense i 've just explained -RRB- ? if yes , who firstly realized that ?
dear all , if <m> G </m> is a group and <m> \langle a \rangle </m> -- any its cyclic subgroup , is it true that there always exists a proper subgroup <m> H </m> in <m> G </m> with <m> G = \langle a \rangle H </m> ? if `` no '' , would it still be true for finite groups <m> G </m> ? thank you ! p.s. : motivation comes from this -- one my colleague applied mathematician asked me if that would be true -- it somehow appears in his research , and i can not see any counter-example to this .
can we define smooth diffeomorphisms on the hilbert cube <m> [ 0 , 1 ] ^ \mathbb { N } </m> ? has it been done in the literature ? for example , let <m> E </m> be the set of bijections <m> f </m> of the hilbert cube , such that <m> f ( ( x _ i ) _ { i \in \mathbb { N } } ) = ( f _ n ( x _ 1 , . . . , x _ n ) , x _ { n + 1 } , . . ) </m> with <m> f _ n </m> a smooth diffeomorphism of <m> [ 0 , 1 ] ^ n </m> for some integer <m> n </m> . the smooth distance on finite-dimensional smooth diffeomorphisms extends to <m> E </m> : <m> d ( f , g ) = d ( f _ { n } , g _ n ) </m> -LRB- we take <m> n </m> to be the maximum of `` dimensions '' of <m> f </m> and <m> g </m> -RRB- . we can take the completion of <m> E </m> for <m> d </m> . has this space been considered before ? if yes , where ? if no , why ?
a standard homework in measure theory textbooks asks the student to prove that there are not countably infinite <m> \sigma </m> - algebras . the only proof that i know is via a contradiction argument which yields no estimate on the minimum cardinality of an infinite <m> \sigma </m> - algebra . given an a set <m> X </m> of infinite cardinality <m> \kappa </m> , the <m> \sigma </m> - algebra of all co-countable subsets of <m> X </m> is of cardinality <m> 2 ^ \kappa </m> <m> \kappa ^ { \aleph _ 0 } </m> . this example does n't tell me whether there are <m> \sigma </m> - algebras of cardinality below <m> 2 ^ { \aleph _ 0 } </m> , if i do n't assume the continuum hypothesis . my question is as the title says : are there <m> \sigma </m> - algebras of every uncountable cardinality ? edit : the combined answer with stephen , matthew proves that the cardinality of a <m> \sigma </m> - algebra is necessarily at least <m> 2 ^ { \aleph _ 0 } </m> . further , for each cardinality <m> \kappa \ge 2 ^ { \aleph _ 0 } </m> with uncountable cofinality , the <m> \sigma </m> - algebra of countable -LRB- or cocountable -RRB- subsets of a set <m> X </m> with cardinality <m> \kappa </m> , is of cardinality <m> \kappa </m> . what is left is whether for <m> \kappa \ge 2 ^ { \aleph _ 0 } </m> with <m> c f ( \kappa ) = \aleph _ 0 </m> are there <m> \sigma </m> - algebras of cardinality <m> \kappa </m> . -LRB- i changed the title to reflect this . -RRB- thanks stephen , matthew , apollo , for the combined work !
let <m> X </m> be a tychonoff topological space . consider the ring <m> C ( X ) </m> of all continuous real valued functions on <m> X </m> . for what conditions on an ideal <m> I </m> of <m> C ( X ) </m> , we could deduce that the quotient ring is isomorphic to a ring of the form <m> C ( Y ) </m> . i.e. question : an ideal <m> I </m> has the algebraic property <m> \mathcal { P } </m> if and only if the exists a tychonoff topological space <m> Y </m> so that : <m> \frac { C ( X ) } { I } \cong C ( Y ) </m>
let <m> G </m> be a finite group and let <m> f : G \longrightarrow \Bbb { C } </m> be any complex-valued function . for integers <m> k , n \geq 0 </m> , an indeterminant <m> t </m> , and <m> x \in G </m> let <m> f _ k ( x ) : = f \big ( x ^ k \big ) </m> and define the <m> t </m> - analogue of <m> n </m> - th symmetric power <m> \text { s y m } ^ n _ t f </m> by the recursion <m> \text { s y m } ^ n _ t f \, = \, { 1 \over n } \, \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ n \, t ^ { k - 1 } \, f _ k \cdot \text { s y m } ^ { n - k } _ t f </m> if <m> f </m> happens to be the character of a finite dimensional complex representation <m> V </m> of <m> G </m> then upon specialising <m> t </m> to the values <m> 1 </m> and <m> - 1 </m> the <m> t </m> - analogue <m> \text { s y m } ^ n _ t f </m> will be respectively the character of the <m> n </m> - th symmetric power and the <m> n </m> - th exterior power of the representation <m> V </m> ; when <m> t = 0 </m> it is <m> { 1 \over { n ! } } </m> times the character of the <m> n </m> - th tensor product of <m> V </m> . it is easy to see that the recursive formula defining <m> \text { s y m } ^ n _ t f </m> is in fact the laplace expansion of the determinant of a certain <m> n \times n </m> matrix , an example of which , in the case of <m> n = 4 </m> , makes the pattern evident : <m> \det \begin {pmatrix} { 1 \over 4 } f _ 1 & { 1 \over 4 } f _ 2 & { 1 \over 4 } f _ 3 & { 1 \over 4 } f _ 4 \\ - t & { 1 \over 3 } f _ 1 & { 1 \over 3 } f _ 2 & { 1 \over 3 } f _ 3 \\ 0 & - t & { 1 \over 2 } f _ 1 & { 1 \over 2 } f _ 2 \\ 0 & 0 & - t & f _ 1 \end {pmatrix} </m> consider now the case of a non-trivial additive character <m> \psi </m> of the finite field <m> \Bbb { F } _ q </m> -- that is to say a map <m> \psi : \Bbb { F } _ q \longrightarrow \Bbb { C } ^ * </m> such that <m> \psi ( 0 ) = 1 </m> and <m> \psi ( x + y ) = \psi ( x ) \, \psi ( y ) </m> for all <m> x , y \in \Bbb { F } _ q </m> . we may restrict <m> \psi </m> to the multiplicative group <m> \Bbb { F } _ q ^ * </m> consisting of all non-zero field elements and over this group form <m> \text { s y m } ^ n _ t \psi </m> . for example when <m> n = 2 </m> and <m> t = 1 </m> this is the function who 's value at <m> x \in \Bbb { F } _ q ^ * </m> is <m> { 1 \over 2 } \psi \big ( 2 x \big ) + { 1 \over 2 } \psi \big ( x ^ 2 \big ) </m> do these <m> t </m> - analogues of the symmetric powers have any number-theoretic significance or meaning -- for example in terms of the various symbols of multiplicative characters or in regard to the evaluation of gauss sums taken over the field ? regards , a. leverkühn
given a set <m> S \subseteq \{ 0 , 1 \} ^ d </m> of the boolean hypercube of dimension <m> d </m> , define the average distance of <m> S </m> as <m> \bar { d } ( S ) = \frac { 1 } { \lvert S \rvert ^ 2 } \sum _ { x , y \in S } d _ H ( x , y ) \tag { 1 } </m> where <m> d _ H </m> denotes the hamming distance . for any <m> 1 \leq n \leq 2 ^ d </m> , define the minimum average distance as <m> \beta ( d , n ) = \min _ { \substack { S \subseteq \{ 0 , 1 \} ^ d \, \lvert S \rvert = n } } \bar { d } ( S ) \tag { 2 } </m> in -LSB- 1 -RSB- , ahlswede and katona asked <m> \beta ( d , n ) </m> for arbitrary <m> n </m> . ahlswede and althöfer , in -LSB- 2 -RSB- , provided asymptotically tight -LRB- in <m> d </m> -RRB- lower bounds on <m> \beta ( d , n ) </m> , when <m> n \geq \binom { d } { \alpha d } </m> for constant <m> \alpha \in ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) </m> : <m> \liminf _ { d \to \infty } \frac { \beta ( d , n ) } { d } \geq 2 \alpha ( 1 - \alpha ) \tag { 3 } </m> in -LSB- 3 -RSB- , althofer and sillke also showed the general bound <m> \beta ( d , n ) \geq \frac { 1 } { 2 } \left ( d + 1 - \frac { 2 ^ { d - 1 } } { n } \right ) \tag { 4 } </m> besides that , there is some work showing optimal bounds for some cases of the form <m> n = 2 ^ { d - 1 } \pm O ( 1 ) </m> -LRB- see e.g. -LSB- 4 -RSB- -RRB- , and it seems most of the more recent work is focused on those , and the structure of optimal large sets achieving these bounds . so it looks like , for <m> n = 2 ^ { d - k } </m> , the cases <m> k = \Theta ( d ) </m> -LRB- via -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- and <m> k = O ( 1 ) </m> are rather well-understood ; but for the general case , -LRB- 4 -RRB- only gives <m> \beta ( d , n ) \geq \frac { 1 } { 2 } \left ( d + 1 - 2 ^ { k - 1 } \right ) \tag { 5 } </m> while the other cases seem to hint at a behavior more like <m> \beta ( d , n ) \approx d - k </m> .
the symbol <m> \Subset </m> -LRB- occurring in places where <m> \subseteq </m> could occur syntactically -RRB- comes up frequently in a paper i 'm reading . the paper lives at the intersection of a few areas of math , and i do n't even know where to begin looking for the meaning of a symbol whose latex code is '' \ subset '' . do you know what this usually denotes ? edit : some context follows . all the sets in question are subsets of <m> \hat { \mathbb { C } } = \mathbb { C } \cup \{ \infty \} </m> . example 1 . in a situation where <m> J </m> is closed with empty interior , <m> U </m> and <m> V </m> are closed with <m> U \subsetneq V </m> , it is written `` note that <m> J \Subset U </m> and , selecting a neighborhood <m> W \subset U </m> of <m> J </m> which is compactly contained in <m> V </m> , ... '' example 2 . in a situation where <m> R </m> is a rational mapping , and where it is assumed that <m> B \subset \hat { \mathbb { C } } </m> is such that <m> R ( B ) \Subset B </m> , it is written `` let <m> \Omega _ 0 = \hat { \mathbb { C } } \setminus B </m> . define <m> \Omega _ 1 = R ^ { - 1 } ( \Omega _ 0 ) </m> . by the properties of <m> B </m> , we have <m> \Omega _ 1 \Subset \Omega _ 0 </m> . if we let <m> U _ 0 </m> be any finite union of closed balls such that <m> \Omega _ 1 \subset U _ 0 \subset \Omega _ 0 </m> , ... '' in both cases i have paraphrased to simplify the notation , so i hope i have not introduced errors into it .
the derivative of a degree <m> 5 </m> polynomial <m> p \in \mathbb { C } [ z ] </m> is a degree four polynomial <m> p ' \in \mathbb { C } [ z ] </m> , and as such , the zeros of <m> p ' </m> may be found explicitly using the quartic formulae . one may think of a finite blaschke product as playing the same role on the unit disk that a polynomial plays on the plane -LRB- in some ways ! -RRB- . in particular , a degree <m> 5 </m> finite blaschke product has <m> 5 </m> zeros and <m> 4 </m> critical points in the disk . however in general , a finite blaschke product <m> B </m> will have additional critical points outside the unit disk . suppose <m> B </m> is a finite blaschke product of degree <m> n = 5 </m> . let <m> w _ 1 , w _ 2 , w _ 3 , w _ 4 \in \mathbb { D } </m> be the critical points of <m> B </m> which lie in the disk . assume that no <m> w _ i = 0 </m> . due to the conjugate symmetry of <m> B </m> , the critical points of <m> B </m> outside the unit disk are exactly <m> 1 / \bar { w _ 1 } , 1 / \bar { w _ 2 } , 1 / \bar { w _ 3 } , 1 / \bar { w _ 4 } \in \mathbb { D } \setminus \overline { \mathbb { C } } </m> . thus if <m> B ' = P / Q </m> for relatively prime polynomials <m> P </m> and <m> Q </m> , then <m> \deg ( P ) = 8 </m> . can the known conjugate symmetry of the degree <m> 8 </m> polynomial <m> P </m> across the unit circle allow us to find its zeros using the quartic formulae ? note 1 : the above is a narrowing of this question on mse , wherein i also asked about whether a degree <m> 8 </m> polynomial <m> p ( z ) </m> whose set of zeros is known to consist of four conjugate pairs could be factored somehow using the quartic formula . note 2 : the same question above goes for degree <m> 4 </m> finite blaschke products . of course for a degree <m> 3 </m> or less blaschke product , there are at most <m> 4 </m> critical points anyway , so one may just use the quartic formula straightforwardly .
let <m> N </m> be a large integer . what is known about distribution of fractional parts <m> \Big \{ \frac { N } { n } \Big \} \in [ 0 , 1 ) </m> after division of <m> N </m> by all odd numbers <m> n </m> in the range <m> 3 \leq n < \sqrt { N } </m> ?
hello , let <m> X </m> be a scheme of finite type over a field <m> k </m> . let <m> l </m> be an galois extension of <m> k </m> with galois group <m> \Gamma </m> , and <m> \overline { X } </m> be the base change of <m> X </m> from <m> k </m> to <m> l </m> . then if i understand correctly -LRB- i do n't understand much -RRB- , i have a functor <m> S h ( X _ { e t } ) \to S h ( \overline { X } _ { e t } ) ^ { \Gamma } </m> , from etale sheaves on <m> X </m> to etale sheaves on <m> \overline { X } </m> , equivariant w.r.t. the action of <m> \Gamma </m> on <m> \overline { X } </m> . my question is whether this is an equivalence of categories , and whether you can give a reference for this . thank you , sasha
in 1986 , don zagier generalized euler 's theorem -LRB- <m> \zeta _ \mathbb { Q } ( 2 ) = \pi ^ 2 / 6 </m> -RRB- to an arbitrary number field <m> K </m> : <m> \zeta _ K ( 2 ) = \frac { \pi ^ { 2 r + 2 s } } { \sqrt { | D | } } \times \sum _ v c _ v A ( x _ { v , 1 } ) . . . A ( x _ { v , s } ) </m> where <m> A ( x ) = \int ^ x _ 0 \frac { 1 } { 1 + t ^ 2 } \log \frac { 4 } { 1 + t ^ 2 } d t </m> in this sense , the result is conjectured to hold for <m> 2 < s \in \mathbb { N } </m> , with the <m> A ( x ) </m> replaced by more complicated functions <m> A _ m ( x ) </m> this might seem rather unenlightening , but we can also state zagier 's result like this :
let <m> p </m> and <m> q </m> be different primes . then for all positive integers <m> i </m> and <m> j </m> there exists integers <m> a _ { i j } </m> and <m> b _ { i j } </m> with <m> a _ { i j } p ^ i + b _ { i j } q ^ j = 1 . </m> what is known about the sequence <m> \left ( ( a _ { i j } , b _ { i j } ) \right ) _ { i , j } </m> of coefficients ? is there an explicit formula for calculating them ? if no , is there a subsequence <m> i _ k </m> , <m> j _ k </m> of indices , for which the sequence of coefficients <m> a _ { i _ k j _ k } </m> and <m> b _ { i _ k j _ k } </m> are known ?
let <m> M </m> be a smooth closed simply-connected <m> 4 </m> - manifold with <m> w _ 1 = w _ 2 = 0 </m> . can <m> T M </m> be trivialized in the complement of a point ?
let <m> \mathcal { C } </m> be the <m> E _ k </m> - monoidal <m> \infty </m> - category of left modules over a fixed connective <m> E _ { k + 1 } </m> - ring spectrum <m> A </m> . suppose that <m> M </m> is an object of <m> \mathcal { C } </m> which is an <m> E _ 0 </m> - algebra , in other words <m> M </m> admits a unit map <m> A \to M </m> . there is an adjunction <m> U \colon A l g _ { E _ k } ( \mathcal { C } ) \leftrightarrows A l g _ { E _ 0 } ( \mathcal { C } ) \colon F </m> by which we can construct the free <m> E _ k </m> - algebra on <m> M </m> . note that the <m> E _ k </m> algebra generated by the <m> E _ 0 </m> - algebra <m> M </m> , i.e. with fixed unit , will not generally be equivalent to the <m> E _ k </m> - algebra generated by <m> M </m> thought of as object of <m> \mathcal { C } </m> -LRB- an algebra for the trivial operad -RRB- . the unit of the adjunction gives a map of <m> E _ 0 </m> - algebras <m> u \colon M \to F ( M ) </m> . i do not have a good description of <m> F ( M ) </m> in general , but i am interested in showing that if the cofiber of the unit map <m> A \to M </m> is <m> d </m> - connected -LRB- so <m> \pi _ \ast ( M / A ) = 0 </m> for <m> \ast < d </m> -RRB- then <m> c o f ( u ) </m> is <m> 2 d </m> - connected . my rough -LRB- and i believe incorrect -RRB- attempt is as follows : we can construct the <m> E _ k </m> - algebra <m> F ( M ) </m> as an operadic left kan extension along the inclusion <m> E _ 0 ^ \otimes \hookrightarrow E _ k ^ \otimes </m> , which tells us that it is -LRB- i think ! -RRB- , just as an object of <m> \mathcal { C } </m> , i.e. ignoring multiplicative structure , equivalent to a colimit over the diagram of injections <m> \langle m \rangle \to \langle n \rangle </m> in <m> F i n _ \ast </m> that live over <m> \langle 1 \rangle </m> . this is a bit terse , but the idea is that you 're supposed to take a colimit over the `` active '' morphisms in <m> E _ 0 ^ \otimes </m> that live over <m> \langle 1 \rangle </m> . recall that <m> E ^ \otimes _ 0 = N ( F i n ^ { i n j } _ \ast ) </m> , i.e. it 's the nerve of the category of finite pointed sets with morphisms <m> f </m> such that <m> f ^ { - 1 } ( i ) </m> has at most one element for each <m> i </m> not the base point in the codomain . in other words , the base point goes to the base point , and everything else either goes to something which is n't hit by anything else , or goes to the base point . also recall that the active morphisms therein are precisely those which only take the base point to the base point , so we 've ruled out all the maps that take non-base-point elements to the base point . thus an active morphism of <m> E _ 0 ^ \otimes </m> is exactly the data of an injection <m> \{ 1 , \ldots , m \} \to \{ 1 , \ldots , n \} </m> -LRB- in particular necessitating that <m> m < n </m> -RRB- . this means then that <m> F ( M ) </m> as an object of <m> \mathcal { C } </m> is the colimit in <m> \mathcal { C } </m> of a diagram whose objects are <m> M ^ { \otimes _ A n } </m> for <m> n \geq 0 </m> , with <m> M ^ { \otimes _ A 0 } = A </m> , and with maps in between them coming from injections on the indexing sets using the unit of <m> M </m> . let 's call the colimit of this diagram <m> N </m> . it seems like <m> N </m> is probably quite complicated , but it obviously admits a map from <m> M </m> since <m> M </m> is in the diagram constructing <m> N </m> . then , using that colimits commute , we can take the cofiber of the inclusion of <m> M </m> into <m> M ^ { \otimes _ A n } </m> for all <m> n > 0 </m> , and produce <m> N / M </m> as <m> c o l i m ( M ^ { \otimes _ A n } / M ) </m> for <m> n > 0 </m> . and here i 'm being really shady by just writing that as some kind of quotient , because there are a lot of maps from <m> M </m> to <m> M ^ { \otimes _ A n } </m> and we 're equalizing all of them . anyway , while <m> N / M </m> is probably quite complicated , it seems like we can say that , at the very least , it is the colimit of a diagram of <m> 2 d </m> - connected spaces , since <m> M </m> is <m> d </m> - connected and every object of that diagram is of the form <m> M ^ { \otimes _ A n } </m> for <m> n > 1 </m> , with possibly a bunch of cells attached when we mod out by all the maps from <m> M </m> . thus at least up to degree <m> 2 d - 1 </m> , <m> M </m> and <m> F ( M ) </m> are equivalent .
in some recent computation i came across certain cubic forms and was wondering about analogue of following result for quadratic forms . if <m> k ^ * / ( k ^ * ) ^ 2 </m> is finite then there are only finitely many quadratic forms up to equivalence . this can be easily seen because of diagonalisation . i have been wondering if we can say following : given <m> k ^ * / ( k ^ * ) ^ 3 </m> is finite is it true that there are only finitely many cubic forms up to equivalence . or can i say something about being isotropic .
denote <m> M _ I ( \lambda ) </m> be the generalized verma module with highest weight <m> \lambda </m> and <m> L ( \mu ) </m> is the simple highest weight module with highest weight <m> \mu </m> . suppose <m> \text { E x t } _ { \mathcal { O } ^ \mathfrak { p } } ^ i \left ( M _ I ( \lambda ) , L ( \mu ) \right ) \neq 0 </m> for some <m> i </m> , does this implies <m> \lambda \le \mu </m> or <m> \lambda = w \cdot \mu </m> for some <m> w \in W </m> ?
in a locally cartesian closed category <m> \mathcal C </m> , for every map <m> f : A \to B </m> , there is an associated pullback functor <m> f ^ * : \mathcal C / B \to \mathcal C / A </m> . moreover , if <m> g : B \to C </m> , the two functors <m> ( g \circ f ) ^ * </m> and <m> f ^ * \circ g ^ * </m> are canonically isomorphic , but they have no reason to be `` equal '' . even in the category of sets , the usual choice of pullbacks is only functorial up to isomorphism -LRB- see this paper of hofmann -RRB- this gives a pseudo functor from <m> \mathcal C ^ \mathrm { o p } </m> to <m> \mathcal { C a t } </m> . the fact that this is only a pseudo functor and not a functor causes some problems when trying to interpret dependent type theory in locally cartesian closed categories -LRB- see for example the previous paper of hofmann , or this paper of curien -RRB- . i was wondering what happens when you pass to <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - categories . intuitively , the fact that pullback are only functorial up to isomorphism should not be a problem anymore , because <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - functors are also only functorial up to isomorphism anyway . so my question is , if <m> \mathcal C </m> is a locally cartesian closed <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - category , does there always exists a functorial choice of pullbacks ? -LRB- by which i mean an <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - functor from <m> \mathcal C ^ \mathrm { o p } </m> to <m> ( \infty , 1 ) \mathcal { C a t } </m> sending objects to slice categories and morphisms to pullback functors -RRB-
if <m> G = \langle a , b : a ^ { p ^ { n } } = 1 = b ^ { p ^ { n + 1 } } , [ b , a ] = b ^ { p } \rangle </m> , such that <m> n \geq 2 </m> and <m> p </m> is an odd prime number , then how can i define a non-inner automorphism of <m> G </m> ? is it possible to find the structure of all automorphisms of <m> G </m> ?
given a family <m> \mathcal { F } </m> of sets over ground set <m> X </m> , let <m> \tau ( \mathcal { F } ) </m> be the transversal number -LRB- aka blocking number -RRB- , that is the cardinality of the smallest set of points <m> E \subseteq X </m> such that every set in <m> \mathcal { F } </m> meets <m> E </m> . lovasz -LRB- problem 13.25 in his problems & exercises books -RRB- has proved that if <m> F </m> is an <m> r </m> - uniform family of sets that every <m> k </m> sets in <m> F </m> intersect , then : <m> \tau ( \mathcal { F } ) \leq \frac { r - 1 } { k - 1 } + 1 . </m> i wonder whether it is possible to strengthen the conclusion if we assume that <m> \mathcal { F } </m> is <m> k </m> - wise <m> t </m> - intersecting -LRB- that is , every <m> k </m> sets in <m> \mathcal { F } </m> intersect in at least <m> t </m> points -RRB- . i can obtain the following by mimicking the proof , but i feel there ought to be a better result somewhere : <m> \tau ( \mathcal { F } ) \leq \frac { r - t } { k - 1 } + 1 . </m>
let <m> S _ n </m> be the symmetric group on the set <m> \{ 1 , 2 , \ldots , n \} </m> and <m> \mathbb { K } </m> a field . denote by <m> \mathbb { K } S _ n </m> the symmetric group algebra . what 's kazhdan-lusztig basis of <m> \mathbb { K } S _ n </m> ? i think that the basis is a <m> \mathbb { K } </m> - linear combination of the elements in <m> S _ n </m> . but i do n't know the specific form .
this is just a general curiosity question : in the standard textbook treatments of characteristic classes , and in particular the treatment of universal pontrjagin classes , it 's standard to consider <m> H ^ \ast ( B S O , Z [ 1 / 2 ] ) </m> -LRB- or <m> H ^ \ast ( B S O ( n ) , Z [ 1 / 2 ] ) </m> -RRB- in order to kill the 2-torsion . but i 'm curious about that 2-torsion , since it should still give us some extra characteristic class-type information about real oriented bundles . if nothing else , it would give a class that 's characteristic in the sense that it behaves the right way with respect to pullbacks -LRB- though i imagine it might be too much for these to be stable or have any kind of product formulas -RRB- . so i suppose my questions are :
given <m> n </m> , can <m> n </m> - dimensional linear algebraic groups over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> be embedded into <m> \mathrm { G L } ( N , \mathbb { C } ) </m> for a uniformly bounded <m> N </m> ? thanks so much for your reply !
prove the existence of the solution of the cauchy problem : <m> u _ t + u _ 0 u _ x + u _ { 0 x } u + u _ { x x x } = 0 , u ( x , 0 ) = 0 </m> where <m> u _ 0 \in C ^ { \infty } ( R ) . u _ 0 , u _ { 0 x } \to 0 , w h e n | x | \to \infty </m> as robert bryant 's comment , <m> u = 0 </m> is a solution.i 'm wondering if there is a another solution.i want to use semi-group theory , but i do n't know how to do that . can anyone help me ?

given <m> n </m> and <m> p </m> for <m> G ( n , p ) </m> , how to find the distribution of the size of the non-empty <m> k </m> - core with largest <m> k </m> ? in particular , what is the probability -LRB- for any <m> n </m> and <m> p </m> -RRB- that only <m> c </m> vertices are not in the last non-empty <m> k </m> - core , where <m> c </m> is a constant ?
let <m> \Phi </m> be a nice young function -LRB- n-function -RRB- and <m> ( \Omega , \mathcal { F } , P ) </m> a probability space such that either <m> P </m> is diffuse on a set of non-zero probability or <m> P </m> is purely atomic and there are infinitely many atoms . in other words <m> ( \Omega , \mathcal { F } , P ) </m> is not a finite probability space . it is said that function <m> \Phi </m> satisfies the <m> \Delta _ 2 </m> condition at infinity if there is <m> K > 0 </m> and <m> u _ 0 \ge 0 </m> such that <m> \Phi ( 2 u ) \le K \Phi ( u ) \text { f o r a l l } u \ge u _ 0 . </m> it is said that modular <m> m </m> given by <m> m ( X ) : = E [ \Phi ( X ) ] </m> is metrizing if for every sequence of random variables <m> \{ X _ n \} </m> one has that <m> m ( X _ n ) \to 0 </m> implies <m> m ( 2 X _ n ) \to 0 </m> . give an example of a young function that does not satisfy the <m> \Delta _ 2 </m> condition , together with a -LRB- purely atomic but infinite -RRB- probability space on which the corresponding modular is metrizing ; or , prove that such an example does not exist . it is known that
let <m> k </m> be a field . the proof that <m> A u t ( \mathbb { P } _ k ^ n ) = P G L ( n + 1 : k ) </m> relies on the fact for any automorphism <m> \alpha </m> of <m> \mathbb { P } _ k ^ n </m> , <m> \alpha ^ * ( \mathcal { O } _ { \mathbb { P } _ k ^ n } ( 1 ) ) = \mathcal { O } _ { \mathbb { P } _ k ^ n } ( 1 ) </m> . it is not necessarily true that <m> \pi ^ * O _ { \mathbb { P } _ A } ( 1 ) \simeq O _ { \mathbb { P } _ A } ( 1 ) </m> if <m> \pi : \mathbb { P } _ A ^ { n } \to \mathbb { P } _ A ^ { n } </m> is an automorphism . see counterexample : https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/979958/automorphism-of-the-projective-space-mathbbp-an in particular , we ca n't use the same type of proof to show that <m> A u t ( \mathbb { P } _ A ^ n ) = P G L ( n + 1 : A ) </m> . furthermore , i do n't think such an equality will exist for an arbitrary ring <m> A </m> . what is the intuitive reason as to why we might not have such equality for arbitrary rings ? what are the conditions on a for which this might be true ? -LRB- other than the obvious one such as a a ufd or a field -RRB-
setting let us regard the hilbert space <m> L ^ 2 ( 0 , 1 ) </m> and the <m> C _ 0 </m> - semigroup <m> ( T ( t ) ) _ { t \geq 0 } </m> defined by <m>  </m> it is easy to verify that this is indeed a <m> C _ 0 </m> - semigroup . therefore , the mapping <m> t \mapsto T ( t ) f </m> is a continuous mapping from <m> L ^ 2 ( 0 , 1 ) </m> to <m> L ^ 2 ( 0 , 1 ) </m> . consequently the <m> L ^ 2 ( 0 , 1 ) </m> - valued integral <m> g : = \int _ 0 ^ 1 T ( t ) f \, \mathrm { d } t </m> exists . question in order to get some information about the behavior of <m> g </m> it would be nice to regard <m> g </m> as a parameter integral . hence i am interested in the following equality <m> g ( x ) = \Big ( \int _ 0 ^ 1 T ( t ) f \, \mathrm { d } t \Big ) ( x ) \stackrel { ? } { = } \int _ 0 ^ 1 \big ( T ( t ) f \big ) ( x ) \, \mathrm { d } t . </m> or with a different notation <m> g = \int _ 0 ^ 1 \big ( x \mapsto \big ( T ( t ) f \big ) ( x ) \big ) \, \mathrm { d } t \stackrel { ? } { = } \Big ( x \mapsto \int _ 0 ^ 1 \big ( T ( t ) f \big ) ( x ) \, \mathrm { d } t \Big ) . </m> the evaluation mapping is neither continuous nor well-defined on <m> L ^ 2 </m> . so i think it is not trivial to justify this step . it seems quite common to evaluate such <m> L ^ 2 ( 0 , 1 ) </m> - valued integrals by interpreting it as a parameter integral , so i guess that there is a theorem which justifies that . it would be really great if someone had a reference . solution for this special case in this particular case i think i have a solution . i know that every convergent sequence in <m> L ^ 2 </m> has a subsequence which converges even point-wise a.e. . since <m> g _ n : = x \mapsto \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \frac { 1 } { n } \Big ( T \Big ( \frac { i } { n } \Big ) f \Big ) ( x ) </m> converges to <m> g </m> and every subsequence of <m> g _ n ( x ) </m> converges in <m> \mathbb { R } </m> to the same limit for a.e. <m> x \in ( 0 , 1 ) </m> , the point-wise limit of <m> g _ n </m> has to coincide with <m> g </m> a.e. .
let <m> C </m> be a smooth complex curve . by the standard algebraic topology -LRB- recall that <m> K ( \mathbb { Z } , 2 ) = \mathbb { P } ^ \infty </m> -RRB- , there exists a map <m> \phi : C \rightarrow \mathbb { P } ^ n </m> for sufficiently large <m> n </m> that corresponds to a generator of <m> H ^ 2 ( C , \mathbb { Z } ) </m> . how can one construct the map <m> \phi </m> and can it be algebraic ?
i 'm wondering if anybody has an easy way to compute the number of subintervals in weak order of <m> S _ n </m> -LRB- considered as a coxeter group of type <m> A _ { n - 1 } </m> -RRB- that are isomorphic to boolean algebras . i know <m> [ u , v ] </m> is such a subinterval if and only if <m> u \leq v </m> and <m> v u ^ { - 1 } </m> is a product of adjacent transpositions that pairwise commute with each other . any insight is appreciated .

the answer to this question might be known , but i do n't know of any reference and will appreciate any references . let <m> n > 0 </m> . by snaith splitting there is a stable splitting of <m> \Omega ^ k S ^ { n + k } </m> into wedge of spaces <m> D _ { k , r } S ^ n = F ( \mathbb { R } ^ k , r ) \ltimes _ { \Sigma _ r } ( S ^ n ) ^ { \wedge r } </m> as <m> \Sigma ^ \infty \Omega ^ k S ^ { n + k } \simeq \bigvee _ { r = 1 } ^ { + \infty } \Sigma ^ \infty D _ { k , r } S ^ n </m> where <m> F ( \mathbb { R } ^ k , r ) </m> is the configuaration space of <m> r </m> distinct points in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ k </m> . it is known that <m> D _ { k , 2 } S ^ n = \Sigma ^ n P _ { n } ^ { n + k - 1 } </m> where <m> P _ n ^ m </m> is the truncated real projective space <m> P ^ m / P ^ { n - 1 } </m> . what i would like to know is about other pieces and specially <m> D _ { k , 2 ^ s } S ^ n </m> with <m> s > 0 </m> . is it known that for any positive <m> k , s , n </m> the space <m> D _ { k , 2 ^ s } S ^ n </m> is suspension of some <m> C W </m> - complex ? if the answer is positive , do we know how many suspension may appear ?
let <m> \chi </m> be a real nonprincipal dirichlet 's character modulo <m> m </m> . in my answer to the question on <m> L ( 1 , \chi ) </m> , i explain a trick for showing that <m> L ( 1 , \chi ) > 0 </m> on the simplest examples of the real characters modulo 3 and 4 . the proof goes as follows : one takes <m> f ( x ) = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \chi ( n ) x ^ n = \frac 1 { 1 - x ^ m } \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { m - 1 } \chi ( j ) x ^ j </m> and uses abel 's theorem to write <m> L ( 1 , \chi ) = \int _ 0 ^ 1 f ( x ) d x ; </m> since the corresponding function <m> f ( x ) </m> is positive on <m> ( 0 , 1 ) </m> , the latter integral has to be positive . clearly , <m> 1 - x ^ m > 0 </m> on <m> ( 0 , 1 ) </m> , so that the required positivity of <m> f ( x ) </m> reduces to the positivity of the polynomial <m> g _ \chi ( x ) = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { m - 1 } \chi ( n ) x ^ n </m> on <m> ( 0 , 1 ) </m> . trying to verify on how generalizable is this method for <m> m > 3 </m> , i was quite surprised to see that it works perfectly further ; for example , <m> g ( x ) = x ( 1 - x ) ( 1 - x ^ 2 ) > 0 \quad \text { i f } m = 5 </m> or <m> g ( x ) = x ( 1 - x ) ( 1 + x ^ 2 + 2 x ^ 3 + 3 x ^ 4 + 2 x ^ 5 + x ^ 6 + x ^ 8 ) > 0 \quad \text { i f } m = 1 1 . </m> honestly saying , the positivity is not so obvious in many other examples -LRB- for example , <m> m = 1 9 </m> -RRB- but nevertheless it is always holds for small values <m> m \le 3 0 </m> . question . given an integer <m> m > 2 </m> and a real nonprincipal character <m> \chi </m> modulo <m> m </m> , is it true that <m> g _ \chi ( x ) > 0 </m> for <m> x \in ( 0 , 1 ) </m> ? if not , are there -LRB- in -RRB- finitely many <m> m </m> for which the positivity does not take place ? is the above strategy for showing <m> L ( 1 , \chi ) \ne 0 </m> discussed in the literature ?
i am currently investigating an equation that is : <m> \partial ^ 2 _ t u = \Delta _ { 3 / 2 } u , </m> where <m> u : \mathbb { R } _ + \times \mathbb { R } ^ d \to \mathbb { R } </m> and <m> \Delta _ { 3 / 2 } </m> stands for the <m> 3 / 2 </m> - laplacian i.e <m> \Delta _ { 3 / 2 } u : = \operatorname { d i v } ( | \nabla u | ^ { 1 / 2 } \nabla u ) </m> . i am looking for a morawetz type inequality : in the setting of the linear wave equation , and if <m> u </m> denotes a solution to this pde , it is known that : <m> \int _ 0 ^ T \int _ { \mathbb { R } ^ d } \frac { | \nabla \! \! \! \! / u | ^ 2 } { | x | } \, \mathrm { d } x \, \mathrm { d } t \leqslant C </m> which is the standard morawetz inequality for the linear wave equation . i tried to follows the method presented in tao 's book `` nonlinear dispersive equations ; local and global analysis '' , page 161 . for the record it consists in finding the stress energy tensor <m> T ^ { i j } </m> : <m> T ^ { 0 0 } </m> must be the energy , and the other quantities satisfied : <m> \partial _ t T ^ { 0 0 } + \partial _ j T ^ { 0 j } = 0 , </m> and <m> \partial T ^ { 0 j } + \partial _ k T ^ { j k } = 0 . </m> then the method consists in computing : <m> \sum _ j \int _ { \mathbb { R } ^ d } \frac { x _ j } { | x | } T ^ { 0 j } \, \mathrm { d } x , </m> and hoping for good by parts integration , and finaly get a morawetz type inequliaty . in my setting , <m> T ^ { 0 0 } = \frac { ( \partial _ t u ) ^ 2 } { 2 } + \frac { 2 } { 5 } | \nabla u | ^ { 5 / 2 } </m> so that <m> T ^ { 0 j } = - \partial _ t u | \nabla u | ^ { 1 / 2 } \partial _ { x _ j } u </m> but we can not find the <m> T ^ { j k } </m> corresponding and the the method of tao does n't give anything that i could use . is there a way to prove a morawetz type inequality for this equation ? thank you .

in connection with determining the number of ways of arranging <m> n </m> copies of each of the <m> n </m> integers 1 upto <m> n </m> in an <m> n </m> by <m> n </m> pandiagonal magic square , i.e. such that the sum of the integers in each row , column and ` broken ' diagonal is the same , the following sub-problem arises . given two integers <m> a </m> and <m> b </m> , whose product is <m> n </m> , how many ways are there to divide the <m> n </m> integers 1 upto <m> n </m> into <m> a </m> groups of <m> b </m> integers in such a way that the sum of the <m> b </m> integers in each of the <m> a </m> groups is the same ? obviously : if <m> n </m> is prime , then <m> a = 1 </m> or <m> b = 1 </m> ; if <m> a = 1 </m> , then <m> b = n </m> and there is only one way ; if <m> b = 1 </m> , then <m> a = n </m> and there are no ways . also if <m> a = 2 </m> , then the problem is equivalent to the number of ways of dividing a <m> b </m> by <m> b </m> chess board into two equal areas using a ` diagonal ' line descending from the top left corner to the bottom right corner , following the edges of the chess squares , and proceeding either to the right or down -LRB- never to the left or up -RRB- . the answer for this special case is known . i have not yet found any mathematician who knows whether or not there is a general solution . having an answer would enable me to extend a proof for a sub set of pandiagonal squares , those that are most-perfect . see ollerenshaw and brée , most-perfect pandiagonal magic squares , or a review of same at journals.cambridge.org/article_s0013091500020381 .
suppose <m> V </m> is a vector space , we say that <m> \mathcal B </m> is a basis for <m> V </m> if :
let <m> G </m> be a quasi-split connected reductive group over a perfect field <m> F </m> , with borel subgroup and maximal torus <m> B \supseteq T </m> defined over <m> F </m> . assume everything splits over a galois extension <m> L / F </m> , with <m> \Gamma = \textrm { G a l } ( L / F ) </m> . the choice of <m> B </m> gives us a set of simple roots <m> \Delta \subseteq \Phi ( G , T ) </m> , and for each <m> \alpha \in \Delta </m> , there exists an isomorphism of algebraic groups <m> x _ { \alpha } </m> of <m> \mathbf { G } _ a </m> onto a closed , one dimensional subgroup <m> U _ { \alpha } </m> of <m> R _ u ( B ) </m> , such that <m> t x _ { \alpha } ( a ) t ^ { - 1 } = x _ { \alpha } ( \alpha ( t ) a ) </m> for all <m> t \in T , a \in \mathbf { G } _ a </m> . such a map <m> x _ { \alpha } </m> is called a root vector for <m> \alpha </m> . if <m> x _ { \alpha } ' </m> is another isomorphism onto <m> U _ { \alpha } </m> with the same property , then there is a unique <m> 0 \neq c \in \mathbf { G } _ a </m> such that <m> x _ { \alpha } ( a ) = x ' _ { \alpha } ( c a ) </m> . <m> \Gamma </m> acts on <m> \Delta </m> by <m> \alpha ^ { \sigma } = \sigma \alpha \sigma ^ { - 1 } </m> . if <m> x _ { \alpha } </m> is a root vector for <m> \alpha </m> , then <m> x _ { \alpha } ^ { \sigma } : = \sigma x _ { \alpha } \sigma ^ { - 1 } </m> is one for <m> \alpha ^ { \sigma } </m> . what i would like to do is the following :
does anyone know of a reference for the fact that if <m> \lambda </m> is a limit of woodin cardinals , then the pointclass <m> ( \Sigma ^ 2 _ 1 ) ^ { \text { H o m } _ { \mathord { < } \lambda } } </m> is <m> \omega </m> - parameterized ? by this i mean that there is a <m> ( \Sigma ^ 2 _ 1 ) ^ { \text { H o m } _ { \mathord { < } \lambda } } </m> set <m> U \subset \omega \times \omega ^ \omega </m> that is universal in the sense that every <m> ( \Sigma ^ 2 _ 1 ) ^ { \text { H o m } _ { \mathord { < } \lambda } } </m> set <m> A \subset \omega ^ \omega </m> is equal to the section <m> U _ n </m> for some <m> n < \omega </m> . as far as i am concerned it would be enough to have a complete <m> ( \Sigma ^ 2 _ 1 ) ^ { \text { H o m } _ { \mathord { < } \lambda } } </m> set <m> U \subset \omega ^ \omega </m> such that every <m> ( \Sigma ^ 2 _ 1 ) ^ { \text { H o m } _ { \mathord { < } \lambda } } </m> set <m> A \subset \omega ^ \omega </m> is equal to the pre-image <m> f ^ { - 1 } ( C ) </m> by some recursive function <m> f </m> . in either case , this seems not entirely trivial to me . suppose that <m> A \in ( \Sigma ^ 2 _ 1 ) ^ { \text { H o m } _ { \mathord { < } \lambda } } </m> , say <m> x \in A \iff \exists B \in \text { H o m } _ { \mathord { < } \lambda } \, ( H C ; \in , A ) \models \varphi [ x ] . </m> it seems like we need to bound the complexity of the formulas <m> \varphi </m> we are considering . one way to do this is to show that if there is a set <m> B \in \text { H o m } _ { \mathord { < } \lambda } </m> with <m> ( H C ; \in , B ) \models \varphi [ x ] </m> then there is also a set <m> B ' \in \text { H o m } _ { \mathord { < } \lambda } </m> with <m> ( H C ; \in , B ' ) \models \psi [ x ] </m> , where <m> \psi </m> is the skolem normal form of <m> \varphi </m> . we can get <m> B ' </m> using the fact that <m> \text { H o m } _ { \mathord { < } \lambda } </m> is projectively closed and every <m> \text { H o m } _ { \mathord { < } \lambda } </m> set admits a <m> \text { H o m } _ { \mathord { < } \lambda } </m> uniformization . this might be more familiar in the equivalent context of <m> \mathsf { A D } ^ + </m> where we would talk about <m> \Sigma ^ 2 _ 1 </m> rather than <m> ( \Sigma ^ 2 _ 1 ) ^ { \text { H o m } _ { \mathord { < } \lambda } } </m> , but i do n't recall having seen any argument for it anywhere . is there a published reference for this ? or perhaps an obvious argument that is simpler than the one i started to sketch above ? by the way , my motivation for asking this is the following . if <m> \lambda </m> is a limit of woodin cardinals and the derived model at <m> \lambda </m> satisfies <m> \theta _ 0 < \Theta </m> -LRB- or equivalently , every <m> \Pi ^ 2 _ 1 </m> set is suslin -RRB- then every <m> ( \Sigma ^ 2 _ 1 ) ^ { \text { H o m } _ { \mathord { < } \lambda } } </m> set becomes <m> \lambda </m> - universally baire in some <m> \mathord { < } \lambda </m> - generic extension <m> V [ g ] </m> . -LRB- more precisely , its re-interpretation in <m> V [ g ] </m> becomes <m> \lambda </m> - universally baire . -RRB- to get a single <m> \mathord { < } \lambda </m> - generic extension <m> V [ g ] </m> in which every <m> ( \Sigma ^ 2 _ 1 ) ^ { \text { H o m } _ { \mathord { < } \lambda } } </m> set is universally baire , it seems like the simplest way would be to consider a universal set .
in shioda 's famous paper `` an example of unirational surfaces in characteristic <m> p </m> '' -LRB- msn -RRB- , the author proved that the fermat surface over the characteristic - <m> p </m> field <m> k </m> <m> x _ 1 ^ n + x _ 2 ^ n + x _ 3 ^ n + x _ 4 ^ n = 0 </m> is unirational if <m> q \equiv - 1 \pmod n </m> for some <m> p </m> - power <m> q </m> . at end of this paper , he mentioned that he proved it in the higher-dimension case with similar method , i.e. , <m> x _ 1 ^ n + x _ 2 ^ n + \cdots + x _ { m + 1 } ^ n = 0 </m> is unirational if <m> m \geq 3 </m> is odd and <m> q \equiv - 1 \pmod n </m> for some <m> p </m> - power <m> q </m> . but i ca n't prove it with his method in the surface case . how does his method generalize ?
let <m> q </m> be a prime power and <m> k </m> a positive integer . what are the possible degrees of faithful projective representations of the projective special linear group <m> \mathrm { P S L } ( k , q ) </m> -LRB- over the galois field <m> \mathrm { G F } ( q ) </m> and of dimension <m> k > 1 </m> -RRB- over the complex numbers ? how about the symplectic group <m> \mathrm { S p } ( 2 k , q ) </m> -LRB- of dimension <m> 2 k \geq 2 </m> -RRB- ? if the above questions are too difficult , what are the lowest degrees of faithful projective representations of <m> \mathrm { P S L } ( k , q ) </m> and <m> \mathrm { S p } ( 2 k , q ) </m> over complex numbers ? i am particularly interested in the two special cases : <m> \mathrm { P S L } ( 4 , 7 ) </m> and <m> \mathrm { S p } ( 6 , 2 ) </m> .
hello . i thank for your answer , in advance . let <m> G </m> be a finite group and <m> G </m> has an element of order <m> n </m> such that <m> \pi ( n ) = \pi ( G ) </m> where <m> \pi ( n ) </m> denote the set of prime divisors of <m> n </m> and <m> \pi ( G ) </m> denote the set of prime divisor of <m> | G | </m> . what can be said about the structure of the group ? i know in nilpotent group there exist such element . i generalize my question . what is the relation between the <m> | \pi ( G ) | </m> and the maximum <m> | \pi ( n ) | </m> , where <m> n </m> range in all order elements of a finite group <m> G </m> ?
in some physical problem the following differential equation appears <m> \dot { x } = F ( x ) + f ( t ) </m> , where the dot denotes derivative with respect to <m> t </m> . <m> x </m> is evidently a function of <m> t </m> . i 'm wondering what the theory of differential equations knows about how to solve these kind of equation . generic solution for arbitrarily nonlinear functions <m> F </m> and and <m> f </m> is desirable without making any assumptions on theses functions . the solution can easily be found for <m> F ( x ) = x </m> and for arbitrary <m> f ( t ) </m> . in principle , one could taylor expand <m> F ( x ) </m> in the vicinity of the origin , and do perturbation theory in terms of higher corrections , but that 's quite trivial and is \ textit -LCB- not -RCB- the subject of my question . upd . by making the substitution <m> x = u ' / u </m> one can reduced the above equation to a riccati type equation provided that <m> F ( x ) </m> is a quadratic polynomial in <m> x </m> .
let <m> \Pi </m> be the twin prime constant and <m> \pi _ 2 ( n ) </m> the twin prime counting function . define <m> t ( n ) = \left | \pi _ 2 ( n ) - 2 \Pi \int _ 2 ^ n \frac { d x } { \ln ( x ) ^ 2 } \right | </m> is it consistent with current data that for <m> n > 1 0 0 </m> we have : <m> t ( n ) < \ln ( n + 2 ) ^ 2 \sqrt { ( n + 2 ) } </m> ?? is there a stronger plausible boundary for <m> t ( n ) </m> ?
let <m> R </m> be a ring with identity . it is readily checked that when the quotient <m> R / S _ r </m> is reduced , the nilpotent elements of <m> R </m> fall into <m> S _ r </m> , where <m> S _ r </m> is the right socle of <m> R </m> . is the converse true ? that is , whenever <m> S _ r </m> contains the nilpotent elements of <m> R </m> , is <m> R / S _ r </m> necessarily reduced ? thanks for any cooperation !
i was reading a paper about solutions to <m> f ( y ) = P ( m ) </m> , where <m> f ( y ) \in \mathbb Z [ y ] </m> and <m> P ( m ) = n ( n + 1 ) \ldots ( n + m - 1 ) </m> is a product of <m> m </m> consecutive integers . on the first page , it is mentioned that it is not difficult to get the solutions in the case that <m> f ( y ) </m> is irreducible . however , i was confused about two things .
typically a walk is defined as a vertex-edge sequence , e.g. <m> ( v _ 1 , e _ 1 , v _ 2 , e _ 2 , v _ 3 ) </m> , but suppose we are working in the undirected simple graph setting . instead , let 's say an edge-sequence <m> ( e _ 1 , e _ 2 ) </m> is a walk from vertex <m> v _ 1 </m> to <m> v _ 3 </m> if we can recover the full vertex-edge sequence definition by inserting vertices into the edge-sequence reasonably , i.e. if a vertex precedes or follows an edge in the sequence it must be incident to that edge . this edge-sequence notation makes things ambiguous in the sense that <m> ( e ) </m> can represent two walks going in either direction along the edge , but we wo n't worry about this . my most general question : for a given graph <m> G </m> , is there an efficient way to count the number of edge-sequences of length <m> k </m> that contain at least one subsequence which is a walk from vertex <m> i </m> to vertex <m> j </m> ? i imagine this might be difficult for generic graphs , so let 's focus on the case where the graph is the complete graph , <m> K _ n </m> . there are <m> { n \choose 2 } ^ k </m> edge sequences of length <m> k </m> . how many of these contain at least one subsequence which is a walk between two distinct vertices <m> i </m> and <m> j </m> ? first two cases : if <m> k = 1 </m> , then there is only one sequence : the one consisting of the edge between the vertices , call it <m> ( e ) </m> . if <m> k = 2 </m> , the way i tried to do this is by systematically building all the sequences from smaller walks and filling the rest of the sequence with dummy edges . there are <m> n - 2 </m> walks of length <m> 2 </m> and no need for dummy edges . there 's only walk of length 1 , so we can have sequences <m> ( e , \bar { e } ) </m> and <m> ( \bar { e } , e ) </m> where <m> \bar { e } </m> represents any of the <m> { n \choose 2 } </m> edges . we must be careful about double counting though , there are n't <m> 2 { n \choose 2 } </m> choices for inserting the dummy edge , but rather , <m> 2 { n \choose 2 } - 1 </m> . thus , we have there are <m> ( n - 2 ) + 2 { n \choose 2 } - 1 </m> sequences of length two that contain at least one subsequence which is a walk between two distinct vertices . the case for <m> k = 3 </m> is way hairier : when building up sequences from walks of length 1 we get <m> { n \choose 2 } ^ 2 + { n \choose 2 } \left ( { n \choose 2 } - 1 \right ) + \left ( { n \choose 2 } - 1 \right ) ^ 2 </m> but some of these are the same as the <m> ( n - 2 ) ( 3 { n \choose 2 } - 2 ) </m> we get when building up from walks of length 2 . i 'd appreciate any references or if anyone has seen this quantity or something similar i 'd love to know about it . perhaps there 's something else it can be mapped to that 's easier to digest . for context , this quantity came up while i was studying contact processes on networks . thanks !
let <m> { \left ( { a ; q } \right ) _ n } = \prod \limits _ { j = 0 } ^ { n - 1 } { ( 1 - { q ^ j } a } ) </m> and let <m> { { n } \brack { k } } _ q </m> denote a <m> q - </m> binomial coefficient . i am interested in <m> q - </m> analogues of the identity <m> \sum \limits _ { j = - k } ^ k { { { ( - 1 ) } ^ { j } } } \binom { n } { k - j } \binom { n } { k + j } = \binom { n } { k } </m> where the left-hand side has the form <m> \sum \limits _ { j = - k } ^ k { ( - 1 ) ^ { j } } q ^ { a ( j ) } { { n } \brack { k - j } } _ q { { n } \brack { k + j } } _ q </m> and the right-hand side gives a simple result . it is known that for <m> a ( j ) = { \frac { j ( 3 j - 1 ) } { 2 } } </m> the right-hand side is <m> { { n } \brack { k } } _ q , </m> for <m> a ( j ) = j ^ 2 </m> the right-hand side is <m> { { n } \brack { k } } _ { q ^ 2 } </m> and for <m> a ( j ) = \binom { j } { 2 } </m> it is <m> q ^ { n k - k ^ 2 } { { n } \brack { k } } _ { q } . </m> computer experiments suggest also the following evaluations : the right-hand side is <m> ( q ^ { k } + q ^ { n - k } - q ^ n ) { { n } \brack { k } } _ { q } </m> for <m> a ( j ) = 3 \binom { j } { 2 } </m> and <m> q ^ k { { n } \brack { k } } _ { q } { \frac { ( - q ^ { n - k + 1 } ; q ) _ { k - 1 } ( 1 + q ^ { n - 2 k } ) } { ( - q ; q ) _ k } } </m> for <m> a ( j ) = 2 \binom { j } { 2 } . </m> i would be interested if the last two results are special cases of some <m> q - </m> hypergeometric summation or if there is a direct proof known .
consider <m> \ell ^ \infty </m> as a subspace of the polish space <m> \mathbb { R } ^ \omega </m> . it is easy to check that <m> \ell ^ \infty </m> is not polish in the subspace topology , as it is countable union of the compact nowhere dense sets <m> \{ f \in \mathbb { R } ^ \omega : \forall m ( | f ( m ) | \leq n ) \} </m> , and hence is not baire . recall a topological group <m> ( G , \tau _ 0 ) </m> is polishable if there is a polish group topology <m> \tau _ 1 </m> on <m> G </m> having the same borel sets as <m> \tau _ 0 </m> . is <m> \ell ^ \infty </m> , with the subspace topology above , polishable ? -LRB- i believe the answer is no . -RRB- note that it is easy to see , using pettis ' theorem , that any such polish topology would be a refinement of the subspace topology . an elementary proof would be prefferred to one which shows that the borel equivalence relation <m> E _ 1 </m> embeds into to the coset equivalence relation <m> \mathbb { R } ^ \omega / \ell ^ \infty </m> , and then cites theorem 4.2 in kechris-louveau , the classification of hypersmooth borel equivalence relations .
i saw this in here . let <m> A </m> be a banach algebra , and let <m> \Lambda </m> be a non-empty set . we denote by <m> M _ \Lambda ( A ) </m> be the set of <m> \Lambda \times \Lambda </m> matrices <m> ( a _ { i j } ) _ { i , j \in \Lambda } </m> with entries in <m> A </m> such that <m> \| ( a _ { i j } ) \| = \sum _ { i , j } \| a _ { i j } \| _ A < \infty </m> . then <m> M _ \Lambda ( A ) </m> is a banach algebra with matrix multiplication . the matrix units in <m> M _ \Lambda ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> are denoted by <m> E _ { i , j } </m> , so that <m> E _ { i , j } E _ { k , l } = \delta _ { j , k } E _ { i , l } ~ ~ ~ ( i , j , k , l \in \Lambda ) , </m> where <m> \delta _ { j , k } = 1 </m> if <m> j = k </m> and <m> \delta _ { j , k } = 0 </m> if <m> j \neq k </m> . the map <m> : ( a _ { i , j } ) \sum _ { i , j } a _ { i , j } \otimes E _ { i , j } , ~ ~ ~ ~ M _ \Lambda ( A ) \to A \hat { \otimes } M _ \Lambda ( \mathbb { C } ) , </m> is an isometric algebra isomorphism . question : how can i show that <m>  </m> is isometric .
let <m> Y </m> be oriented 3 manifold with torus boundary and let <m> \gamma _ { j } </m> -LRB- j = 0,1,2 -RRB- be three curves on its boundary with <m> \# ( \gamma _ { j } \cap \gamma _ { j + 1 } ) = - 1 </m> . we denote by <m> Y _ { j } </m> the manifold obtained by gluing a solid torus to <m> Y </m> with meridian <m> \gamma _ { i } </m> . it was proved by kronheimer-mrowka-ozvath-szabo that there exists an exact triangle relating <m> \check { H M } ( Y _ { j } ; \mathbb { Z } _ { 2 } ) </m> . as mentioned in kronheimer-mrowka 's book , one can expect there should be an exact triangle relating <m> \check { H M } ( Y _ { j } ; \mathbb { Z } ) </m> and the proof should be very similar to the <m> \mathbb { Z } _ 2 </m> case . my question is that : is there any paper checking the detail of the proof for this <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - coefficient exact triangle ? -LRB- note that a <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - coefficient exact triangle for heegaard-floer homology was proved by ozvath-szabo -RRB- .
let <m> G </m> be the group of all permutations of <m> \mathbb { N } </m> . if i am not mistaken , this group is denoted by <m> S ^ { \infty } </m> . is there a precise locally compact topology on <m> G </m> such that <m> G </m> would be an amenable group ? or is <m> G </m> isomorphic to a dense subgroup of an amenable group ?
let us call an algebraic variety <m> X </m> an iterated <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> - bundle if it is either a point or a locally trivial <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> - bundle over <m> X ' </m> , which is another iterated <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> - bundle . it is easy to construct examples of such varieties as toric varieties . another -LRB- non-toric in general -RRB- examples of such varieties are the bott-samelson varieties .
let <m> K </m> be a local field and <m> E / K </m> an elliptic curve such that the set of <m> N </m> - torsion points , <m> E [ N ] </m> , is contained in <m> E ( K ) </m> . for <m> e </m> in <m> E [ N ] </m> , i am interested in finding and expression for the function <m> f _ e </m> in k -LRB- e -RRB- such that <m> d i v ( f _ e ) = N ( e ) - N ( 0 ) </m> . more concretely , i am interested in the values of <m> f _ e </m> when restricted to the formal group of <m> E </m> . i guess using the weierstrass preparation theorem could gives us an idea of how <m> f _ e </m> can be factored , but what about the coefficients of the series that appear on the product ? i know there is an algorithm , miller 's algorithm , that allows one to compute f _ e , but the expression is quite complicate . there is also a <m> p </m> - adic analogue of the sigma function , due to tate , for the case in which e has ordinary reduction , which allows one to find an expression for f _ e as a product of these functions . what about the case of super-singular reduction ? the general case ? any insights or references would be greatly appreciated .
given positive integers <m> a </m> , <m> m </m> and <m> n </m> , let <m> s _ { a ( m ) } ( n ) </m> denote the sum of the reciprocals of the prime numbers less than or equal to <m> n </m> which are congruent to <m> a </m> modulo <m> m </m> . is there an integer <m> n </m> such that <m> s _ { 1 ( 3 ) } ( n ) > s _ { 2 ( 3 ) } ( n ) </m> ? for small <m> n </m> , the function <m> s _ { 2 ( 3 ) } </m> is clearly ahead -- for example it exceeds <m> 1 </m> already at <m> n = 5 9 </m> , while for <m> s _ { 1 ( 3 ) } </m> this takes until <m> n = 3 5 6 0 5 0 3 </m> . even if the answer is no , are there still other residue classes <m> a ( m ) </m> and <m> b ( m ) </m> such that the function <m> f _ { a ( m ) , b ( m ) } : \mathbb { N } \rightarrow \mathbb { R } , \ \ n \mapsto s _ { a ( m ) } ( n ) - s _ { b ( m ) } ( n ) </m> has infinitely many sign changes ? does <m> f _ { a ( m ) , b ( m ) } ( n ) </m> converge for <m> n \rightarrow \infty </m> , and if so , is there anything known about the constants <m> c _ { a ( m ) , b ( m ) } : = \lim _ { n \rightarrow \infty } f _ { a ( m ) , b ( m ) } ( n ) </m> ?
does anyone know if the right banach <m> \mathcal { B } ( H ) </m> - module <m> \mathcal { K } ( H ) </m> is injective ? the same question for <m> \ell _ \infty </m> - module <m> c _ 0 </m> . both these modules are not dual , so standard arguments via flatness does n't work . injectivity is understood in the following sense : a banach module <m> J </m> over banach algebra <m> A </m> is called injective if for any admissible bounded morphism of <m> A </m> - modules <m> \xi : X \to Y </m> and any bounded morphism of <m> A </m> - modules <m> \varphi : X \to J </m> there exists a bounded morphism of <m> A </m> - modules <m> \psi : Y \to J </m> such that <m> \psi \xi = \varphi </m> . note , a bounded morphism of <m> A </m> - modules is called admissible if it admits a left inverse bounded linear operator .
i wonder how well one can obtain algebraic structures that satisfy interesting algebraic identities by simply slowly modifying those algebraic structures until they satisfy the required identities . i have used this technique to come up with multiplication tables on semigroup , and i have used a similar technique for endowing the classical laver tables with compatible linear orderings and compatible lattice orderings , but i wonder if these are cases where this technique always converges . suppose that <m> \mathcal { L } , \mathcal { M } </m> are algebraic languages . all algebraic structures in this post are assumed to be finite . we say that an <m> \mathcal { M } </m> - structure <m> \mathcal { X } </m> is <m> \mathcal { M } \setminus \mathcal { L } </m> - close to an <m> \mathcal { M } </m> - structure <m> \mathcal { Y } </m> if <m> \mathcal { X } , \mathcal { Y } </m> have the same underlying set <m> X </m> and there exists a function symbol <m> f \in \mathcal { M } \setminus \mathcal { L } </m> of arity <m> n \geq 0 </m> along with <m> x _ { 1 } , \dots , x _ { n } \in X </m> where <m> g ^ { \mathcal { X } } = g ^ { \mathcal { Y } } </m> whenever <m> g \in \mathcal { M } \setminus \{ f \} </m> and where <m> f ^ { \mathcal { X } } ( y _ { 1 } , \dots , y _ { n } ) = f ^ { \mathcal { Y } } ( y _ { 1 } , \dots , y _ { n } ) </m> whenever <m> ( y _ { 1 } , . . . , y _ { n } ) \neq ( x _ { 1 } , . . . , x _ { n } ) </m> . in other words , <m> \mathcal { X } </m> is <m> \mathcal { M } \setminus \mathcal { L } </m> - close to <m> \mathcal { Y } </m> precisely when <m> \mathcal { X } </m> and <m> \mathcal { Y } </m> differ only on at most one input on one fundamental operation . suppose that <m> u _ { 1 } , \dots , u _ { n } , v _ { 1 } , \dots , v _ { n } </m> are terms in the language <m> \mathcal { M } </m> . suppose that <m> \alpha _ { 1 } , \dots , \alpha _ { n } </m> are natural numbers . let <m> u = ( u _ { 1 } , \dots , u _ { n } ) , v = ( v _ { 1 } , \dots , v _ { n } ) , \alpha = ( \alpha _ { 1 } , \dots , \alpha _ { n } ) </m> . let <m> \mathcal { X } </m> be a <m> \mathcal { M } </m> - structure . let <m> \beta _ { i } </m> be the cardinality of the set of all all <m> x _ { 1 } , \dots , x _ { r } </m> such that <m> u _ { i } ^ { \mathcal { X } } ( x _ { 1 } , \dots , x _ { r } ) \neq v _ { i } ^ { \mathcal { X } } ( x _ { 1 } , \dots , x _ { r } ) </m> . then the <m> ( u , v , \alpha ) </m> - score of <m> \mathcal { X } </m> is the sum <m> \alpha _ { 1 } \beta _ { 1 } + \dots + \alpha _ { n } \beta _ { n } </m> . we say that an algebra <m> \mathcal { X } </m> is a local <m> ( u , v , \alpha ) </m> minimum over <m> \mathcal { L } </m> if whenever <m> \mathcal { Y } </m> is <m> \mathcal { M } \setminus \mathcal { L } </m> - close to <m> \mathcal { X } </m> and <m> \mathcal { X } </m> has <m> ( u , v , \alpha ) </m> - score <m> \beta _ { \mathcal { X } } </m> and <m> \mathcal { Y } </m> has <m> ( u , v , \alpha ) </m> - score <m> \beta _ { \mathcal { Y } } </m> then <m> \beta _ { \mathcal { X } } \leq \beta _ { \mathcal { Y } } </m> . then we say that <m> ( \mathcal { R } , u , v , \alpha ) </m> is convergent if the only algebras <m> \mathcal { X } </m> with <m> \mathcal { X } | _ { \mathcal { L } } = \mathcal { R } </m> that are local <m> ( u , v , \alpha ) </m> minimum over <m> \mathcal { L } </m> are the algebras that satisfies the identities <m> u _ { 1 } = v _ { 1 } , \dots , u _ { n } = v _ { n } </m> . if <m> ( \mathcal { R } , u , v , \alpha ) </m> is convergent , then the following algorithm may be used to construct algebras <m> \mathcal { X } </m> that satisfy the identities <m> u _ { 1 } = v _ { 1 } , \dots , u _ { n } = v _ { n } </m> and where <m> \mathcal { R } = \mathcal { X } | _ { \mathcal { L } } </m> . step <m> 0 </m> : let <m> \mathcal { X } _ { 0 } </m> be randomly generated algebra such that <m> \mathcal { R } = \mathcal { X } _ { 0 } | _ { \mathcal { L } } </m> . step <m> n + 1 </m> : if <m> \mathcal { X } _ { n } </m> satisfies the identities <m> u _ { 1 } = v _ { 1 } , \dots , u _ { n } = v _ { n } </m> , then return <m> \mathcal { X } _ { n } </m> . otherwise , let <m> \mathcal { X } _ { n + 1 } </m> be an algebra which is <m> \mathcal { M } \setminus \mathcal { L } </m> close to <m> \mathcal { X } _ { n + 1 } </m> but where the <m> ( u , v , \alpha ) </m> - score of <m> \mathcal { X } _ { n + 1 } </m> is lower than the <m> ( u , v , \alpha ) </m> - score of <m> \mathcal { X } _ { n } </m> . one may need to do a brute force search to find a suitable algebra <m> \mathcal { X } _ { n + 1 } </m> . what are some examples of convergent tuples <m> ( \mathcal { R } , u , v , \alpha ) </m> ? example : let <m> u _ { 1 } ( x , y ) = x \wedge y , u _ { 2 } ( x , y ) = x \vee y , u _ { 3 } ( x ) = x \wedge x , u _ { 4 } ( x ) = x \vee x , u _ { 5 } ( x , y , z ) = ( x \wedge y ) \wedge z , u _ { 6 } ( x , y , z ) = ( x \vee y ) \vee z , u _ { 7 } ( x , y ) = ( x \wedge y ) \vee x , u _ { 8 } ( x , y ) = ( x \vee y ) \wedge x , v _ { 1 } ( x , y ) = y \wedge x , v _ { 2 } ( x , y ) = y \vee x , v _ { 3 } ( x ) = x , v _ { 4 } ( x ) = x , v _ { 5 } ( x , y , z ) = x \wedge ( y \wedge z ) , v _ { 6 } ( x , y , z ) = x \vee ( y \vee z ) , v _ { 7 } ( x , y ) = x , v _ { 8 } ( x , y ) = x </m> . let <m> u = ( u _ { 1 } , . . . , u _ { 8 } ) , v = ( v _ { 1 } , . . . , v _ { 8 } ) </m> . an algebra <m> ( X , \wedge , \vee ) </m> is a lattice if and only if it satisfies the identities <m> u _ { i } = v _ { i } </m> for <m> i \in \{ 1 , \dots , 8 \} </m> . define <m> \alpha = ( n ^ { - 2 } , n ^ { - 2 } , n ^ { - 1 } , n ^ { - 1 } , n ^ { - 3 } , n ^ { - 3 } , n ^ { - 2 } , n ^ { - 2 } ) </m> . then the <m> ( u , v , \alpha ) </m> - score of an algebra <m> ( X , \vee , \wedge ) </m> is the sum <m> P _ { 1 } + . . . . + P _ { n } </m> where <m> P _ { i } </m> is the probability that <m> u _ { i } ( \mathbf { x } ) \neq v _ { i } ( \mathbf { x } ) </m> for randomly selected inputs <m> \mathbf { x } </m> .
marc 's answer to my previous question gives a way to compute colimits in the category of presentable <m> \infty </m> - categories and continuous functors , using the -LRB- discontinuous -RRB- right adjoints to those functors . but in particular it is not true that the forgetful functor from presentable <m> \infty </m> - categories and continuous functors , to all <m> \infty </m> - categories and functors , preserves all colimits . does it preserve all filtered colimits ? i am sorry if the answer is easy to find in lurie 's textbook . i was n't able to do so right away .
this question is related to my other question . consider a scheme <m> X </m> over <m> S = \text { S p e c } ( \mathbb { k } ) </m> where <m> \mathbb { k } = \overline { \mathbb { F } _ p } ) </m> ; let <m> F : X \rightarrow X </m> be the frobenius <m> p </m> - th power map , and let <m> m </m> be a positive integer . briefly , a <m> \mathcal { D } </m> - module of level <m> m </m> over <m> X = \mathbb { A } ^ n </m> is a module over the algebra <m> \mathbb { k } [ x , \partial _ x , \frac { { \partial _ x } ^ p } { p ! } , \cdots , \frac { { \partial _ x } ^ { p ^ m } } { ( p ^ m ) ! } ] </m> -LRB- for the general definition of <m> \mathcal { D } </m> - modules of level <m> m </m> over <m> S </m> , see my other question -RRB- . denote the category of <m> \mathcal { D } </m> - modules of level <m> m </m> by <m> \mathcal { D } _ X ^ m - \text { m o d } </m> . given a <m> \mathcal { D } </m> - module of level <m> m </m> , <m> \mathcal { F } </m> , i was told that <m> F ^ * \mathcal { F } </m> can be given the structure of a <m> \mathcal { D } </m> - module of level <m> m + 1 </m> , and that this construction gives an equivalence <m> \mathcal { D } _ X ^ m - \text { m o d } \simeq \mathcal { D } _ X ^ { m + 1 } - \text { m o d } </m> . -LRB- maybe a better way of phrasing this statement is that given a crystalline <m> \mathcal { D } </m> - module <m> \mathcal { G } </m> , i.e. a <m> \mathcal { D } </m> - module of level <m> 0 </m> , then <m> ( F ^ m ) ^ * \mathcal { G } </m> can be given the structure of a <m> \mathcal { D } </m> - module of level <m> m </m> -RRB- . i was wondering how to prove this statement . edit : so i found the relevant paper by berthelot mentioned below by david ; my understanding is that the above statement actually seems to be true as stated -LRB- without imposing the condition that the categories has <m> 0 </m> -LRB- <m> m </m> - th order -RRB- <m> p </m> - curvature -RRB- ; see theorem <m> 2 . 3 . 6 </m> on pg <m> 4 7 </m> of berthelot 's paper for a more precise general statement and proof . this theorem answers my above question .
i have encountered the following exponential sum and i would like to obtain a non-trivial upper bound for it . i am not quite sure where to start , and i would greatly appreciate any suggestions on how i can go about to obtain an upper bound or where to look . let <m> q \in \mathbb { N } </m> , and <m> \chi _ i </m> be a dirichlet character modulo <m> q </m> -LRB- not necessarily primitive -RRB- , and <m> F ( x _ 1 , \ldots , x _ n ) </m> is a homogeneous polynomial of degree <m> d </m> with integer coefficients which defines a smooth hypersurface over <m> \mathbb { P } ^ { n - 1 } </m> . the exponential sum in question is <m> \sum _ { \mathbf { x } \in ( \mathbb { Z } / q \mathbb { Z } ) ^ n } \chi _ 1 ( x _ 1 ) \cdots \chi _ n ( x _ n ) \ e \left ( F ( \mathbf { x } ) \frac { a } { q } \right ) , </m> where <m> ( a , q ) = 1 </m> . i would greatly appreciate any suggestions or comments . thank you very much for your time .
this is probably a silly question with which i am stuck however . let <m> G </m> be a locally compact group . it seems to me that there is a canonical map of <m> L _ \infty ( G ) </m> into <m> M = C _ 0 ( G ) ^ { * * } </m> -LRB- the latter is the enveloping von neumann algebra of <m> C _ 0 ( G ) </m> -RRB- . i would reason as follows :
let <m> X </m> be a twist of the <m> n </m> - th projective space , seen as a <m> K </m> - variety for some number field <m> K </m> . for <m> n = 1 </m> , the hasse principle holds for <m> X </m> .
numerical evidence suggest that the class number of the quadratic field <m> x ^ 2 = 3 \cdot 2 ^ n + 1 </m> is <m> O ( n ) </m> while the discriminant is <m> O ( 2 ^ n ) </m> . here are the class numbers for <m> n = 6 \dots 1 1 0 </m> computed with pari/gp : 1 , 2 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 4 , 1 , 3 , 2 , 4 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 4 , 48 , 1 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 4 , 2 , 2 , 1 , 8 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 5 , 1 , 2 , 6 , 35 , 3 , 80 , 25 , 2 , 4 , 24 , 4 , 4 , 12 , 8 , 2 , 1 , 24 , 12 , 2 , 8 , 8 , 1 , 8 , 4 , 13 , 104 , 4 , 2 , 1 , 8 , 4 , 8 , 400 , 2 , 4 , 1 , 1 , 4 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 4 , 4 , 2 , 10 , 80 , 2 , 16 , 2 , 16 , 2 , 372 , 4 , 32 , 4 , 46 , 8 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 6 , 1 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 8 , 4 , 12 , 4 , 8 , 8 , 4 , 72
i have a question which is not really precise , unfortunately . let <m> A </m> be a poisson <m> n </m> - algebra , i.e. a graded commutative algebra with a lie bracket of degree <m> n - 1 </m> s.t. the bracket is a biderivation w.r.t. the commutative product . add a new square-zero variable <m> \varepsilon </m> to <m> A </m> , possibly of positive degree , to get <m> A [ \varepsilon ] </m> . clearly this is a graded commutative algebra , and there is also a shifted lie bracket <m> [ a + \varepsilon b , a ' + \varepsilon b ' ] : = [ a , a ' ] + \varepsilon ( [ a , b ' ] \pm [ a ' , b ] ) </m> . if <m> A </m> has some geometric meaning -LRB- and this is the imprecise part -RRB- , does <m> A [ \varepsilon ] </m> also has some geometric meaning ? i 'm open to various notions of `` geometric meaning '' . i found this appearing in an algebro-topological setting , and i 'm wondering if there is a bigger picture i do n't know about . this may be something very simple . my best guess is that <m> A [ \varepsilon ] </m> is twice the dimension of <m> A </m> , so perhaps this is related to some -LRB- co -RRB- tangent bundle ... ?
let <m> V </m> be a finite dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero . let <m> A </m> be the space of maps in <m> \mathrm { E n d } ( V ^ { \otimes n } ) </m> which commute with the natural <m> G L ( V ) </m> action . clearly , any permutation of the tensor factors is in <m> A </m> . i am looking for an elementary proof that these permutations span <m> A </m> . if <m> \dim V \geq n </m> , there is a very simple proof . take <m> e _ 1 </m> , <m> e _ 2 </m> , ... , <m> e _ n </m> in <m> V </m> linearly independent and let <m> \alpha \in A </m> . then <m> \alpha ( e _ 1 \otimes e _ 2 \otimes \cdots \otimes e _ n ) </m> must be a <m> t _ 1 t _ 2 \cdots t _ n </m> eigenvector for the action of the matrix <m> \mathrm { d i a g } ( t _ 1 , t _ 2 , \ldots ) </m> in <m> G L ( V ) </m> . so <m> \alpha ( e _ 1 \otimes \cdots \otimes e _ n ) = \sum _ { \sigma \in S _ n } c _ { \sigma } e _ { \sigma ( 1 ) } \otimes \cdots \otimes e _ { \sigma ( n ) } </m> for some constants <m> c _ { \sigma } </m> . it is then straightforward to show that <m> \alpha </m> is given by the corresponding linear combination of permutations . i feel like there should be an elementary , if not very well motivated , extension of the above argument for the case where <m> \dim V < n </m> , but i 'm not finding it . motivation : i 'm planning a course on the combinatorial side of <m> G L _ N </m> representation theory -- symmetric polynomials , jdt , rsk and , if i can pull it off , some more modern things like honeycombs and crystals . since it will be advertised as a combinatorics course , i want to prove a few key results that give the dictionary between combinatorics and representation theory , and then do all the rest on the combinatorial side . based on the lectures i have outlined so far , i think this will be one of the few key results . the standard proof is to show that the centralizer of <m> k [ S _ n ] </m> is spanned by <m> G L ( V ) </m> , and then apply the double centralizer theorem . although the double centralizer theorem -LRB- at least , over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> -RRB- does n't formally involve anything i wo n't be covering , i think it is pretty hard to present it to people who are n't extremely happy with the representation theory of semi-simple algebras . so i am looking for an alternate route .
i would like to know a simple proof of isometric injectivity of <m> L _ \infty </m> . the proof i 've found in topics in banach space theory . f. albiac , n. kalton uses two deep result .
by a partial function from <m> \omega </m> to <m> \omega </m> we understand a function <m> f : d o m ( f ) \to \omega </m> defined on an infinite subset of <m> \omega </m> . a family <m> \mathfrak F </m> of partial functions from <m> \omega </m> to <m> \omega </m> is called domain almost disjoint -LRB- briefly , dad -RRB- if the family <m> ( d o m ( f ) ) _ { f \in \mathcal F } </m> is almost disjoint in the sense that for any distinct partial functions <m> f , g \in \mathcal F </m> the intersection <m> d o m ( f ) \cap d o m ( g ) </m> is finite . let <m> \mathfrak b _ a </m> be the smallest cardinality of a dad family <m> \mathfrak F </m> of partial functions from <m> \omega </m> to <m> \omega </m> such that for every function <m> g : \omega \to \omega </m> there exists a partial function <m> f \in \mathcal F </m> such that <m> f ( n ) \not \le g ( n ) </m> for infinitely many numbers <m> n \in d o m ( f ) </m> . it is easy to see that <m> \mathfrak b \le \mathfrak b _ a \le \mathfrak d </m> . question . is the strict inequality <m> \mathfrak b < \mathfrak b _ a </m> consistent ? remark . the affirmative answer to this question implies a positive answer to this problem . namely , the strict inequality <m> \mathfrak b < \mathfrak b _ a </m> implies the exitence of a monotone cofinal map <m> \omega ^ \omega \to \mathfrak b ^ { \mathfrak b } </m> .
on a riemannian manifold <m> ( M , g ) </m> , let <m> \mathcal L ^ p ( M , k ) </m> denote the space of measurable <m> k </m> - tensors <m> T </m> -LRB- i.e. , the coordinate components in any chart are lebesgue measurable -RRB- for which the norm <m> | | T | | _ p = \int _ M | T | ^ p \, d \mu _ g , \quad | T | = \sqrt { T _ { i _ 1 \cdots i _ k } T ^ { i _ 1 \cdots i _ k } } </m> is finite . is this space complete ? in compact case , i obtained an affirmative answer on math stack exchange , but the answer does not seem to carry over to the general case . the book by chavel , eigenvalues in riemannian geometry , seems to claim this is true . he offers no proof .
suppose <m> X / \mathbb C </m> is a projective <m> \mathbb Q </m> - factorial variety with wild singularities . let <m> N </m> be a nef <m> \mathbb R </m> - cartier divisor . then is it possible that there are infinitely many curves <m> C _ i \subset X </m> , such that <m> C _ i \cdot N > 0 </m> are infinitely close to <m> 0 </m> ? notice that if <m> N </m> is a <m> \mathbb Q </m> - cartier divisor , then if <m> C \cdot N > 0 </m> , it must satisfy <m> C \cdot N > \frac 1 m </m> for some <m> m </m> such that <m> m N </m> is cartier . also , if <m> N </m> is an ample <m> \mathbb R </m> - cartier divisor , then it can be written -LRB- in the ample cone -RRB- as <m> \sum r _ i A _ i </m> with <m> r _ i \in \mathbb R _ { > 0 } </m> and <m> A _ i </m> <m> \mathbb Q </m> - cartier ample divisor , hence the statement does not hold either . i am trying to work with kodaira/nagata example of a surface with infinitely <m> ( - 1 ) </m> - curves -LSB- hartshorne 's book v ex 4.15 -LRB- e -RRB- -RSB- , but i have no idea of finding such <m> N </m> ...
i have heard sometimes that the only dimensions <m> k </m> for which there exists a `` good '' smooth product <m> P : S ^ k \times S ^ k \to S ^ k </m> are <m> k = 0 , 1 , 3 , 7 </m> -LRB- the above products corresponding to <m> \mathbb Z _ 2 , U ( 1 ) \subset \mathbb C </m> , the product of unit quaternions and of unit cayley numbers -RRB- . i would like to ask for references about such a result . more precisely , i am interested in finding out how is it that one can define `` good '' so that the above is true -LRB- with proofs , preferably -RRB- .
the notion of minimality in model theory is related to the existence of a gap in the size of definable subsets of a model . now consider the following generalization : definition 1 : let <m> M </m> be a <m> \mathcal { L } </m> - structure . define : <m> D e f ( M ) : = \{ X \subseteq D o m ( M ) ~ | ~ \exists n \in \omega ~ ~ ~ \exists \varphi ( x , y _ 1 , . . . , y _ n ) \in \mathcal { L } - F o r m ~ ~ ~ </m> <m> \exists b _ 1 , . . . , b _ n \in D o m ( M ) ; ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ X = \{ a \in D o m ( M ) ~ | ~ M \vDash \varphi ( a , b _ 1 , . . . , b _ n ) \} \} </m> definition 2 : let <m> \kappa > \lambda \geq \aleph _ { 0 } </m> be two cardinals . a model <m> M </m> called <m> ( \kappa , \lambda ) </m> - minimal if <m> \forall X \in D e f ( M ) ; ~ ~ ~ ~ | X | \geq \kappa ~ \vee ~ ~ | X | \leq \lambda </m> . assuming consistency of <m> \text { Z F } </m> : question 1 : does <m> \text { Z F } </m> have a <m> ( \kappa , \lambda ) </m> - minimal model for each <m> \kappa > \lambda \geq \aleph _ { 0 } </m> ? if the answer of the above question is negative : question 2 : does <m> \text { Z F } </m> have an extension like <m> T </m> such that <m> T </m> has a <m> ( \kappa , \lambda ) </m> - minimal model for each <m> \kappa > \lambda \geq \aleph _ { 0 } </m> ? question 3 : for which -LRB- probably large -RRB- cardinals like <m> \kappa > \lambda \geq \aleph _ { 0 } </m> does <m> \text { Z F } </m> have a <m> ( \kappa , \lambda ) </m> - minimal model ?
let <m> f : \mathbb R ^ n \to \mathbb R </m> be a smooth function . then the first derivative <m> f ^ { ( 1 ) } </m> makes sense as a function <m> \mathbb R ^ n \to \mathbb R ^ n </m> , and the second derivative makes sense as a function <m> f ^ { ( 2 ) } : \mathbb R ^ n \to \{ \text { s y m m e t r i c } n \times n \text { m a t r i c e s } \} </m> . i would like either a proof or a counterexample to the following claim :

question . let <m> C </m> be a generic smooth curve of degree <m> d </m> in <m> \mathbb { C P } ^ 2 </m> , and let <m> P </m> be an arbitrary point away from this curve . how many lines are there through point <m> P </m> that are tangent , or have tangency of order <m> k </m> -LRB- for any <m> k </m> between 3 and <m> d </m> -RRB- with <m> C </m> ? probably this can be done for small <m> d </m> using the equation for <m> C </m> , but i would like to find out if there is a formula for general <m> d </m> .
i know that finite limits do not commute with filtered colimits in general in <m> \mathbf { C G W H } </m> , nevertheless , do colimits commute with pullbacks , when we consider diagrams of the form <m> \begin {matrix} & & B \\ & & \downarrow \\ c o l i m _ { \mathcal { C } } F & \rightarrow & A \end {matrix} </m> when <m> \mathcal { C } </m> is a pushout , and the map <m> B \rightarrow A </m> is a closed inclusion ?
in the paper of herbert clemens curves on generic hypersurfaces the author shows that for a generic hypersurface <m> V </m> of <m> { \mathbb P } ^ n </m> of sufficiently high degree there is no rational curve on <m> V </m> . the main theorem is a general statement about immersed genus <m> g </m> curves in <m> V </m> , and it seems rather elementary to remove the immersed condition for rational curves , and derive the above statement about rational curves . but what is the argument ? is it because every rational curve in <m> { \mathbb P } ^ n </m> is a multiple cover of an immersed one -LRB- if so why is this true -RRB- ? or is it because of the property of <m> V </m> ?
let <m> X </m> be the jacobian of a genus 2 curve over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> . let <m> L = \mathcal { O } ( n C ) </m> , where n is an even number . is it possible to find a smooth curve from <m> | L | </m> which is fixed by the involution <m> x \mapsto - x </m> and which passes through the sixteen 2-torsion points ? i have the following ideas : 1 -RRB- if we take <m> n </m> to be sufficiently large , <m> L </m> will be very ample . consider <m> \hat { X } </m> , the blow up of <m> X </m> at the sixteen 2-torsion points , <m> b : \hat { X } \longrightarrow X </m> . let <m> E _ 1 , . . . , E _ { 1 6 } </m> be the exceptional divisors , let <m> E = \Sigma E _ i </m> . then the curves i am interested in <m> | b ^ * L - E | </m> . this has no basepoints . so by bertini there is a open dense subset of the complete linear system consisting of smooth curves . now the global sections <m> H ^ 0 ( b ^ * L - E ) </m> breaks up into <m> + </m> and <m> - </m> eigen spaces because the involution acts on it . curves coming from either the <m> + </m> space or the <m> - </m> space passes through all 16 points and is fixed by the involution . but will they be smooth ? -LRB- thanks @francesco polizzi and @abx for the answers to two related questions that i asked from which this idea is entirely based on : curve through the 16 singular points of a kummer surface and a curve in an abelian surface and its image in the kummer surface -RRB- . 2 -RRB- the other idea is this . if <m> X = J ( C ) </m> , we can make sure that the involution <m> i </m> on <m> X </m> restricts to the hyperelliptic involution on <m> C </m> . we can also make <m> C </m> pass through 0 . so <m> i ^ * \mathcal { O } ( C ) = \mathcal { O } ( C ) </m> . now we have <m> [ 2 ] : X \longrightarrow X </m> , multiplication by 2 . choose <m> L = \mathcal { O } ( n C ) </m> where <m> 4 | n </m> . under <m> [ 2 ] </m> , <m> \mathcal { O } ( \frac { n } { 4 } C ) </m> pulls back to <m> L </m> . so <m> n C </m> maps to some curve <m> C ' \in | \mathcal { O } ( \frac { n } { 4 } C ) | </m> which will contain 0 ? and so <m> n C </m> contains all 2-torsion points ? i am not quite confident about these arguments . but i am required to use these in the course of work i do . i have asked other similar questions to which i have got some very enlightening answers . i would be grateful for help in this direction too !
let <m> U </m> be a quasi-compact open dense subscheme of a scheme <m> S </m> and let <m> X \rightarrow U </m> be a finite surjective morphism . does there exist a finite morphism <m> Y \rightarrow S </m> such that the <m> U </m> - scheme <m> Y _ U </m> is isomorphic to <m> X </m> ? if that helps , feel free to assume that all the schemes involved are noetherian or that all the maps in question are of finite presentation .
shoenfield absoluteness is well known for <m> \Pi _ 2 ^ 1 </m> - statements , but it does not hold between a countable transitive model of zfc and the universe . but it is also known that <m> \Pi _ 1 ^ 1 </m> statements are absolute between a countable transitive model of set theory and the universe . my question is : where can i find a good reference for the last fact ?
when i was doing some task in number theory which involves bounds for the riemann zeta function , i was stuck on the following question : let <m> \zeta </m> be the riemann zeta function and let <m> \zeta ^ { ( k ) } </m> be the <m> k - </m> th derivative of the riemann zeta function . there exist real numbers <m> E _ { 1 k } ( a ) \leq 0 </m> and <m> E _ { 2 k } ( a ) \geq 1 </m> such that <m> \zeta ^ { ( k ) } ( s ) - a \neq 0 </m> for <m> \{ s \in C ; \ \sigma \leq E _ { 1 k } ( a ) , \ | t | \geq 1 \} </m> and <m> \{ s \in C ; \ \sigma \geq E _ { 2 k } ( a ) \} </m> . let <m> E ' _ { 1 k } ( a ) </m> be a sufficiently small constant for example <m> E ' _ { 1 k } ( a ) \leq m i n \{ E _ { 1 k } ( a ) , - 1 \} </m> such that <m> \left | \frac { a } { \zeta ^ { ( k ) } ( s ) } \right | < 1 </m> for <m> \sigma \leq E ' _ { 1 k } ( a ) </m> and <m> | t | \geq 1 . </m> let <m> \delta = - E ' _ { 1 k } ( a ) </m> and let <m> A </m> be a positive large real number and <m> A < D \leq 2 A . </m> my question is the following : can we have an explicit value for <m> \frac { \zeta ^ { ( k ) } ( 1 - s ) } { \zeta ( s ) } </m> or are there some estimations for the term <m> \frac { \zeta ^ { ( k ) } ( 1 - s ) } { \zeta ( s ) } </m> ? note : for <m> 1 + \delta + i A \leq s \leq 1 + \delta + i D . </m> many thanks .
let <m> H </m> be an infinite-dimensional hilbert space and let <m> \mathcal { B } ( H ) </m> be the -LRB- c * / w * - -RRB- algebra of bounded operators on it . actually , you may forget about the involution in <m> \mathcal { B } ( H ) </m> because i am interested in <m> \mathcal { B } ( H ) </m> only as a banach algebra -LRB- operator algebra -RRB- . do there exist two infinite-dimensional banach algebras <m> A , B </m> such that <m> \mathcal { B } ( H ) </m> is isomorphic as a banach algebra to the projective tensor product <m> A \otimes _ \gamma B </m> ? you may also replace the projective tensor product by any other banach algebra tensor product which arises from a reasonable crossnorm -LRB- so the vna tensor product is not good -RRB- .
let <m> k </m> be an algebraically closed field , <m> T </m> a <m> k </m> - scheme -LRB- can assume connected -RRB- and <m> X </m> a projective variety over <m> k </m> . let <m> \mathcal { F } </m> be a coherent -LRB- pure -RRB- sheaf on <m> X \times _ k T </m> flat over <m> T </m> . assume further that the dual <m> \mathcal { H } o m _ { \mathcal { O } _ { X _ T } } ( \mathcal { F } , \mathcal { O } _ { X _ T } ) </m> is flat over <m> T </m> , where <m> X _ T : = X \times _ k T </m> . suppose for some point <m> t \in T </m> , the natural morphism <m> \mathcal { H } o m _ { \mathcal { O } _ { X _ T } } ( \mathcal { F } , \mathcal { O } _ { X _ T } ) \otimes k ( t ) \to \mathcal { H } o m _ { \mathcal { O } _ { X _ t } } ( \mathcal { F } _ t , \mathcal { O } _ { X _ t } ) </m> is an isomorphism -LRB- or surjection -RRB- , where <m> k ( t ) </m> is the residue field of <m> \mathcal { O } _ { T , t } </m> , <m> X _ t : = X \times _ k t </m> and <m> \mathcal { F } _ t </m> is the restriction of <m> \mathcal { F } </m> to <m> X _ t </m> . then , does there exist an open neighbourhood <m> U </m> of <m> t </m> in <m> T </m> such that for all <m> u \in U </m> , the induced morphism : <m> \mathcal { H } o m _ { \mathcal { O } _ { X _ T } } ( \mathcal { F } , \mathcal { O } _ { X _ T } ) \otimes k ( u ) \to \mathcal { H } o m _ { \mathcal { O } _ { X _ u } } ( \mathcal { F } _ u , \mathcal { O } _ { X _ u } ) </m> is an isomorphism -LRB- or surjection -RRB- ? edit : an equivalent -LRB- slightly vague -RRB- formulation of this question is , whether the sheaves <m> \operatorname { E x t } ^ i ( \mathcal { F } , m _ u ) </m> is upper-semicontinuous in some sense , where <m> m _ u </m> is the maximal ideal <m> \mathcal { O } _ { X _ T , u } </m> ?
let <m> G </m> - discrete group . consider <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra <m> C ^ * _ \gamma ( G ) \subset B ( \ell ^ 2 ( G ) ) </m> which is generated by operators <m> T _ g : \delta _ x \mapsto \delta _ { g x g ^ { - 1 } } </m> where <m> g \in G </m> . are there some good properties of such group <m> C ^ * </m> - algebras ? is it true that if <m> G </m> - inner amenable group then <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra <m> C ^ * _ \gamma ( G ) </m> belongs to the uct-class ?
recently i was thinking about this problem : consider only positive integers . given <m> N </m> , find the largest <m> U </m> which can be expressed as the product of two integers less than or equal to <m> N </m> , in at least two different ways . it turns out that such <m> U </m> must be of this form : <m> U = p ( q - 1 ) \times q ( p - 1 ) = p q \times ( p - 1 ) ( q - 1 ) </m> where <m> p q \leq N </m> . let <m> n ^ 2 \leq N < ( n + 1 ) ^ 2 </m> . if <m> N = n ^ 2 </m> or <m> N = n ( n + 1 ) </m> or <m> N = n ( n + 2 ) </m> , it is easy to figure out that one of <m> p , q </m> is <m> n </m> and the other is <m> N / n </m> . the problem arises when 1 -RRB- <m> n ^ 2 < N < n ^ 2 + n </m> ; 2 -RRB- <m> n ^ 2 + n < N < n ^ 2 + 2 n </m> . i analyzed case 2 -RRB- . let <m> \alpha = N - n ^ 2 - n </m> . it seems <m> p , q </m> should be of this form : <m> n + 1 + k + j </m> and <m> n - j </m> with <m> k \geq 1 </m> and <m> j = \lceil - \frac { k + 1 } { 2 } + \sqrt { k n + ( \frac { k + 1 } { 2 } ) ^ 2 - \alpha } \rceil </m> to find the optimal <m> k </m> , let <m> k = 1 </m> and <m> j = \lceil - 1 + \sqrt { n + 1 - \alpha } \rceil </m> and search if there is any <m> k , j </m> with larger <m> p q </m> . for example , when <m> N = 4 3 5 </m> , take <m> k = 1 </m> we get <m> 2 4 * 1 8 </m> but there is a better one , <m> k = 3 </m> with <m> 2 9 * 1 5 </m> . anybody has thought about this problem before ? is there anything more we can do about it ?
two papers i have looked at lately axiomatize <m> n </m> - th order arithmetic in a single sorted language with predicates <m> Z _ 1 , \dots , Z _ n </m> and axioms like <m> \forall x ( Z _ 1 ( x ) \vee \dots \vee Z _ n ( x ) ) </m> to say everything has one of the orders <m> 1 , \dots , n </m> . another axiom says nothing has two distinct orders , and another says that if <m> x \in y </m> then <m> x </m> has order one lower than <m> y </m> . the axioms use finite disjunctions over the predicates <m> Z _ n </m> , not quantifiers on <m> n </m> . i can type all that out in symbols if people feel it would be helpful . my question is : are there any technical differences to beware of between such axioms for <m> n </m> - th order arithmetic and axioms in an <m> n </m> - sorted language with type rules ? the <m> n </m> - sorted version immediately translates into the single-sorted . then , intuitively the axioms on <m> Z _ 1 , \dots , Z _ n </m> should be true , but of course they do not follow as translates of anything provable -LRB- or even expressible -RRB- in the <m> n </m> - sorted version . the single-sorted has many sentences not translating naturally into the <m> n </m> - sorted , though intuitively those sentences are never true or useful in any way . is there a more sophisticated translation that i am not thinking of ? or do you somehow prove the untranslatable sentences are irrelevant ?
adjoints in a 2-category are essentially unique , in the following strong sense . if <m> \mathbf { 2 } </m> denotes the `` walking arrow '' category <m> ( \cdot \to \cdot ) </m> , then there is a 2-category <m> \mathrm { A d j } _ 1 </m> with two objects , and a map <m> \mathbf { 2 } \to \mathrm { A d j } _ 1 </m> , such that for any 2-category <m> K </m> the precomposition functor <m> \mathrm { C a t } ( \mathrm { A d j } _ 1 , K ) \to \mathrm { C a t } ( \mathbf { 2 } , K ) </m> is fully faithful and its image consists of the 1-morphisms in <m> K </m> with right adjoints . is an analogous fact true for adjoints in an <m> ( \infty , 2 ) </m> - category ? if so , what is the <m> ( \infty , 2 ) </m> - category <m> \mathrm { A d j } _ { \infty } </m> ? a natural conjecture would be that <m> \mathrm { A d j } _ { \infty } = \mathrm { A d j } _ 1 </m> ; i 'm not quite sure whether to hope for that . -LRB- i 'm assuming that an `` adjoint '' in an <m> ( \infty , 2 ) </m> - category <m> K </m> means a morphism whose image in the homotopy 2-category of <m> K </m> has an adjoint in the usual sense . so in a sense , this question is about `` coherentification '' of adjoints . -RRB-
i know that the dual of a tensor product is the tensor product of the duals . for example , the dual space of <m> V \otimes V ^ * </m> is <m> V ^ * \otimes V </m> . i also know that the induced dual space mapping of a tensor product is the product of the individual dual space maps : <m> \langle \boldsymbol { \omega } \otimes \mathbf { v } , \mathbf { w } \otimes \boldsymbol { \gamma } \rangle = \langle \boldsymbol { \omega } , \mathbf { w } \rangle \langle \boldsymbol { \gamma } , \mathbf { v } \rangle </m> . what is the induced dual space mapping for an element of <m> \Lambda ^ p ( V ) </m> ? by my calculation it 's dual space is <m> \Lambda _ p ( V ) </m> and the dual space mapping is <m> p ! </m> multiplied by a determinant of the matrix of all the simple dual space maps . does anyone know the formulae in `` common use '' if there is one ? i am flummoxed by all of the conventions in use .
the title pretty much summarizes the question : does every <m> p </m> - group have a faithful unipotent representation -LRB- with coefficients in <m> \mathbb { F } _ p </m> or some finite extension thereof -RRB- ?
-LRB- apologies if this question is too basic ! -RRB- i have explicit 5-dimensional real representations of <m> \mathfrak { s o } ( 3 ) </m> and <m> \mathfrak { s o } ( 2 , 1 ) </m> , and i want to know whether it 's necessarily true that the lie groups generated by exponentiating these particular lie subalgebras of <m> \mathfrak { g l } ( 5 ) </m> are , in fact , embedded copies of <m> S O ( 3 ) </m> and <m> S O ( 2 , 1 ) </m> , respectively , in <m> G L ( 5 ) </m> . these particular subalgebras are contained in the standard representations of <m> S O ( 5 ) </m> and <m> S O ( 3 , 2 ) </m> , respectively , but i do n't know whether that 's sufficient to answer the question .
let <m> f : \mathbb { R } \longrightarrow \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> be a continuous map which sends any interval <m> I \subseteq \mathbb { R } </m> to a convex subset <m> f ( I ) </m> of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> . is it true that there must be a line in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> which contains the image <m> f ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> of <m> f </m> ? yes , this question seems rather elementary , but i have already spent -LRB- or lost ? -RRB- too much time on this devilish problem , and i have communicated this question to sufficiently many people to know that it is far from trivial ...
let <m> P _ 0 </m> be a minimal parabolic subgroup of a connected , reductive group <m> G </m> over a <m> p </m> - adic field <m> k </m> . let <m> P </m> be a parabolic subgroup containing <m> P _ 0 </m> with levi decomposition <m> P = M N </m> . let <m> N ^ - </m> be a group such that <m> P ^ - = M N ^ - </m> is opposite to <m> P </m> . let <m> \pi </m> be a smooth , irreducible representation of <m> M </m> , and consider a function <m> f </m> in the space of the induced representation <m> \sigma = \operatorname { I n d } _ { P } ^ G \pi </m> . then <m> f </m> is locally constant , and there is a compact set <m> Z </m> such that if <m> f ( x ) \neq 0 </m> , then <m> p x \in Z </m> for some <m> p \in P </m> , i.e. <m> f </m> is compactly supported modulo <m> P </m> . i have seen in a few talks and papers the practice of fixing a function <m> f \in \sigma </m> which vanishes outside of the open set <m> P N ^ - </m> . i was wondering a couple of things : 1 . are are there `` many '' such functions ? how do we know that they exist at all ? 2 . if <m> f </m> vanishes outside <m> P N ^ - </m> , since <m> N ^ - </m> is the union of its open compact subgroups , is it possible to find a compact open subgroup <m> N _ 0 </m> of <m> N ^ - </m> such that if <m> f ( x ) \neq 0 </m> , then <m> p x \in N _ 0 </m> for some <m> p \in P </m> ? question 2 seems like a natural thing to expect , but i could not prove it . i thought i might take the image in <m> P \backslash G </m> of the support of <m> f </m> , which is compact , and cover it by the images of the open compact subgroups <m> N _ 0 </m> . the problem is that i do n't think the images of <m> N _ 0 </m> are open in <m> P \backslash G </m> , since they are not open in <m> G </m> .
it 's known that <m> J _ 0 ( N ) = J ( X _ 0 ( N ) ) = \bigoplus _ f E ( f ) </m> splits as a sum of abelian varieties parametrized by the hecke eingenfunctions and that it 's an elliptic curve iff the hecke eingenvalue is an ordinary integer . of course , there are other induced splittings by the fricke involution , however the finest one is by the hecke eingenfunctions . however i 've heard that each <m> E ( f ) </m> has a real multiplication . is it true ? any references ? thanks in advance .
assume we have an pseudodifferential operator <m> P : \mathcal { S } ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) \rightarrow \mathcal { S } ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) , P f ( x ) = ( 2 \pi ) ^ { - n / 2 } \int \mathrm { d } \xi \; p ( x , \xi ) \, \hat { f } ( \xi ) e ^ { i \xi x } </m> acting on schwarz-functions . assume it is of degree <m> m </m> , that is we have <m> | \partial _ \xi ^ \alpha \partial _ x ^ \beta p ( x , \xi ) | \leq C _ { \alpha , \beta } \, ( 1 + | \xi | ) ^ { m - | \alpha | } </m> for some real <m> m </m> and multiindices <m> \alpha , \beta </m> . now , assume that p is elliptic , that is <m> c ( 1 + | \xi | ) ^ m \leq | p ( x , \xi ) | </m> for some constant . now it is a standard result , that one has the following elliptic <m> L ^ 2 </m> - estimate : <m> \lVert f \rVert _ { W ^ { s , 2 } } \le C ( \lVert P f \rVert _ { W ^ { s - m , 2 } } + \lVert f \rVert _ { W ^ { s - m , 2 } } ) </m> my question : is there a <m> L ^ p </m> - generalization of this estimate ? if yes , where can i find a reference to it ?
inside the derived category of nisnevich sheaves with transfers there is the category <m> D M ^ { e f f } </m> of voevodsky 's effective motivic complexes -LRB- actually , voevodsky only considered bounded above complexes , but it seems that the unbounded version is al well understood now -RRB- . abstract nonsense easily yields the existence of the right adjoint <m> R </m> to this embedding . did anyone study it ? it seems to be much less popular than the left adjoint given by suslin complexes . what can one say about <m> R ( \Omega ^ i ) </m> -LRB- i.e. about the image of the sheaf of algebraic differentials put in degree <m> 0 </m> -RRB- ?
let <m> E </m> be an elliptic curve defined over a number field <m> F </m> and <m> F _ \infty </m> be the cyclotomic <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> - extension of <m> F </m> . is it true that the <m> p </m> - primary subgroup of <m> E </m> over <m> F _ \infty </m> i.e. <m> E [ p ^ \infty ] ( F _ \infty ) </m> is finite ? proofs or references are welcome .
i know that if we assume zero sharp we obtain for a class of standard ordinals <m> L _ \alpha \prec L _ \beta </m> , <m> \alpha < \beta </m> and obviously <m> L _ \alpha \in L _ \beta </m> . my question is : if we only assume the existence of a standard transitive model , and from it we have a countable standard ordinal <m> \alpha </m> , <m> L _ \alpha \models Z F C </m> , being for example <m> L _ \alpha </m> the minimal model , then there exist <m> N </m> elementary end-extension <m> L _ \alpha \prec N </m> and <m> L _ \alpha \in N </m> ? , <m> N </m> not necessarily externally well-founded . any help or reference would be appreciated .
if <m> ( X , \tau ) </m> is a topological space , we call <m> A \subseteq X </m> a retract if there is a continous map <m> r : X \to A </m> such that <m> r ( a ) = a </m> for all <m> a \in A </m> -LRB- we assume <m> A </m> to be endowed with the subspace topology inherited from <m> X </m> -RRB- . by <m> \text { R e t r } ( X ) </m> we denote the collection of retracts of <m> X </m> . is there a non-discrete , infinite <m> T _ 2 </m> - space <m> ( X , \tau ) </m> such that <m> | \text { R e t r } ( X ) | = 2 ^ { | X | } </m> ?
i 'd like to have a reference for the property <m> 0 \leq \alpha < \alpha ' \leq \infty \implies R _ \alpha ( \mu ) > R _ { \alpha ' } ( \mu ) </m> , where <m> R _ \alpha ( \mu ) </m> is the rényi entropy of order <m> \alpha </m> of a probability <m> \mu </m> on a finite set . the book thermodynamics of chaotic systems : an introduction by beck & schlögl provides a proof of this inequality but does not provide the equality <m> \lim _ { \alpha \to \infty } R _ \alpha ( \mu ) = - \log \max \{ \mu _ i \} = : R _ \infty ( \mu ) </m> .
suppose that a polynomial <m> p ( z ) </m> of degree <m> n </m> does not assume the value <m> w </m> for <m> | z | < 1 </m> , that is <m> p ( z ) \neq w </m> for <m> | z | < 1 . </m> show that <m> p ( z ) - \dfrac { ( 1 - e ^ { i \psi } ) } { n } z p ^ { \prime } ( z ) \neq w </m> for <m> | z | < 1 , \psi \in \mathbb { R } . </m> the polar derivative of a polynomial <m> p ( z ) </m> is defined as <m> D _ \alpha p ( z ) : = n p ( z ) + ( \alpha - z ) p ^ { \prime } ( z ) \qquad \alpha \in \mathbb { C } . </m> if all the zeros of <m> p ( z ) </m> lie inside a circular region <m> \mathcal { C } , </m> then by laguerre 's separation theorem -RSB- 1 the zero <m> w </m> of <m> D _ \alpha p ( z ) </m> and the point <m> \alpha </m> can not lie both outside <m> \mathcal { C } . </m> above result follows by applying laguerre 's theorem to <m> p ( z ) - w . </m> i am looking for a proof which is independent of laguerre 's theorem .
definition . according to shelah , a field <m> K </m> does not have the independence property -LRB- i.e. is nip -RRB- if for every first order formula <m> \varphi ( x , \bar y ) </m> in the language of fields <m> ( + , \times , 0 , 1 ) </m> , the vapnik -- chervonenkis dimension of the family of subsets <m> \{ \varphi ( K , \bar k ) : \bar k \in K ^ n \} </m> is finite , i.e. there do not exist arbitrarily large finite sets <m> A \subset K </m> whose subsets are all of the form <m> A \cap \varphi ( K , \bar k ) </m> for some <m> \bar k </m> from <m> K ^ n </m> . examples of nip fields include , in characteristic <m> p </m> finite fields -LRB- easy -RRB- , <m> \mathbf F ^ { a l g } </m> , and in zero characteristic , <m> \mathbf C </m> , <m> \mathbf R </m> and <m> \mathbf Q _ p </m> . a theorem of i. kaplan asserts that a nip field has no artin-schreier extension . i found theorem -LRB- i. kaplan , f. wagner and t. scanlon -RRB- . a valued field of characteristic <m> p </m> with perfect infinite nip residue field , with <m> p </m> - divisible value group and which is algebraically maximal -LRB- <m> i . e . </m> with no proper algebraic valued extension having both same residue field and same valued group -RRB- is nip . i am not familiar with valuation theory , so the above is of little help to me , but for those who know , question : would you have any concrete examples of nip fields of characteristic <m> p > 0 </m> ? -LRB- non separably closed -RRB- i am looking for one which has a cyclic -LRB- galois -RRB- extension .
we know that lcm -LRB- 1 , ... n -RRB- is approximately <m> e ^ n </m> and and also we know that <m> g c d ( 2 ^ a - 1 , 2 ^ b - 1 ) = 2 ^ { g c d ( a , b ) } - 1 </m> . i wonder if there exists an upperbound/lowerbound/approximation for <m> l c m ( 2 ^ 1 - 1 , 2 ^ 2 - 1 , . . . , 2 ^ n - 1 ) </m> .
in an early paper , gh hardy talks about the distribution of `` curious '' sum : <m> \sum _ { \nu \leq n } \{ \nu \theta \} ^ 2 = \tfrac { 1 } { 1 2 } n + O ( 1 ) </m> where <m> \{ x \} : = x - \left \lfloor x \right \rfloor - 1 / 2 </m> . with a computer it was not hard to verify the linear growth , the factor of <m> \frac { 1 } { 1 2 } </m> or the constant error term . here are my experiments :
let <m> i : X \hookrightarrow Y </m> be a closed embedding of smooth algebraic varieties . in the book d-modules , perverse sheaves and representation theory the authors say that there exists a locally free resolution of the <m> i ^ { - 1 } \mathcal { O } _ Y </m> - module <m> \mathcal { O } _ X </m> called the koszul resolution . namely , they say it is <m> 0 \rightarrow K _ { n - r } \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow K _ 1 \rightarrow K _ 0 = i ^ { - 1 } \mathcal { O } _ Y \rightarrow \mathcal { O } _ X , </m> and choosing a local coordinate system such that on the open subset <m> U \subseteq Y </m> we have <m> X \cap U = \{ y _ { r + 1 } = \dots = y _ n = 0 \} </m> , we have <m> K _ { j } = \bigwedge ^ j \left ( \bigoplus _ { s = r + 1 } ^ n \; i ^ { - 1 } \mathcal { O } _ Y d y _ { r } \right ) . </m> i do n't understand whether this resolution exists globally or only locally . i guess it exists globally , but i do n't understand how to define it . both answers and references are welcome .
let <m> X = \mathbb { A } ^ 1 _ { \mathbb { C } } / \mathbb { Z } </m> , where <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> acts on <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 1 </m> via translation . -LSB- to clarify , <m> X </m> is an \ ` etale sheaf with a smooth presentation <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 1 _ { \mathbb { C } } \to X </m> by a scheme . -RSB- note that <m> X </m> is a finite type algebraic space over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> -LRB- in the sense of the stacks project -RRB- . this algebraic space has appeared several times on mo -LRB- see for instance why is this not an algebraic space ? -RRB- . also , as jason starr explains in the comments , the diagonal <m> X \to X \times X </m> is a morphism of finite type algebraic spaces , but it is not of finite type -LRB- because it is not quasi-compact -RRB- . thus , <m> X </m> is not quasi-separated over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> , and therefore <m> X </m> is not of finite presentation over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> . my previous question about the stack <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 1 _ { \mathbb { Z } } / \mathbb { Z } </m> was question 2 before , and was answered by laurent moret-bailly in the comments . this leaves one last question : question . the torsor <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 1 \to X </m> is an example of a <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - torsor whose total space is an algebraic curve . are there other similar examples of <m> G </m> - torsors <m> C \to Y </m> over a finite type algebraic space <m> Y </m> , where <m> G </m> is an infinite discrete group and <m> C </m> is an algebraic curve ? preferably with <m> C </m> not <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 1 </m> or <m> \mathbb { G } _ m </m> .
there is a theorem which gives a classification of connected open sets of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } </m> . unfortunately , i do n't remember the correct statement , but it looks like this theorem ? let <m> U \subset \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } = \mathbb { C } </m> be a connected open subset , then <m> U </m> is conformally equivalent to <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } - \cup _ { n \in \mathbb { N } } I _ { n } </m> , where <m> I _ { n } </m> is either empty or an interval of the form <m> [ z , z + x _ { n } ] </m> where <m> z </m> is a complex number and <m> x _ { n } </m> is a positive real number . conformally equivalent means that there exists a <m> C ^ { 1 } </m> - diffeomorphism <m> f : U \rightarrow \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } - \cup _ { n \in \mathbb { N } } I _ { n } </m> such that <m> d f _ { u } </m> preserves angles for any <m> u \in U </m> .
for <m> A \in S U ( 2 , C ) </m> , it is clear that <m> A </m> is completly determined by its first row -LRB- well any row or column , but let 's say first column -RRB- . in the general <m> S U ( n , C ) </m> - case this is no longer true . in fact , it seems that for every complex <m> n </m> - vector of unit norm , there exists a family of matrices for which the vector is the first column . by working with messy simultaneous equations i seem to have shown that every two elements of this family differ by a multiple of <m> S U ( n - 1 ) </m> embedded in the bottom right hand corner with 1 in the first entry of the first column and zeros everywhere else . i suspect that there is a bijective correspondence between elements of this family and <m> S U ( n - 1 ) </m> but ca n't prove it . can anyone give a simple slick reworking of all of this ?
can someone give me references for the structure of the <m> G _ { \mathbf { F } _ q } </m> - module <m> T _ \ell A </m> , <m> A / \mathbf { F } _ q </m> an abelian variety ?
so the large cardinal axioms are for the most part considered to be linearly ordered by consistency strength . for the large cardinals between extendibility and rank-into-rank -LRB- i.e. the <m> n </m> - huge cardinals -RRB- , by using a little help from algebra , i have formulated large cardinal axioms where i have no idea about the consistency strength of these axioms . suppose that <m> \gamma </m> is a limit ordinal . if <m> f </m> is a function , then define <m> f \upharpoonright _ { \gamma + 1 } : V _ { \gamma + 1 } \rightarrow V _ { \gamma + 1 } </m> be the function defined by <m> f \upharpoonright _ { \gamma + 1 } ( x ) = f ( x ) \cap V _ { \gamma } </m> for each <m> x \subseteq V _ { \gamma } </m> . define <m> \mathbf { E E } _ { \gamma } </m> to be the collection of all functions <m> f : V _ { \gamma + 1 } \rightarrow V _ { \gamma + 1 } </m> such that for each <m> \alpha > \gamma + 1 </m> there is a <m> \beta </m> and an elementary embedding <m> j : V _ { \alpha } \rightarrow V _ { \beta } </m> with <m> j \upharpoonright _ { \gamma + 1 } = f </m> . then <m> \mathbf { E E } _ { \gamma } </m> can be endowed with a self-distributive operation <m> * </m> defined by <m> f * g = j ( k ) \upharpoonright _ { \gamma + 1 } </m> where there are ordinals <m> \gamma \leq \delta < \alpha \leq \beta </m> with <m> j : V _ { \alpha } \rightarrow V _ { \beta } , k : V _ { \gamma } \rightarrow V _ { \delta } </m> and where <m> j \upharpoonright _ { \gamma + 1 } = f , k \upharpoonright _ { \gamma + 1 } = g </m> . if <m> X </m> is a finite self-distributive algebra , then let <m> \mathrm { L C } ( X ) </m> be the axiom that posits that there is some limit ordinal <m> \gamma </m> such that <m> \mathbf { E E } _ { \gamma } </m> has a subalgebra isomorphic to <m> X </m> . for example , if <m> ( X , * ) </m> is the algebra where <m> X = \{ 0 , \dots , n \} </m> and <m> x * y = 1 </m> whenever <m> x \leq y </m> and <m> x * y = y </m> whenever <m> y < x </m> , then <m> \mathrm { L C } ( X ) </m> is equivalent to the existence of <m> n </m> extendible cardinals . the axioms of the form <m> \mathrm { L C } ( X ) </m> are large cardinal axioms , but there does not seem to be any natural linear pre-ordering on the class of all finite self-distributive algebras <m> \leq </m> where if <m> \mathrm { L C } ( X ) </m> and <m> \mathrm { L C } ( Y ) </m> are both consistent , then <m> X \leq Y </m> if and only if <m> \mathrm { C o n } ( \mathrm { L C } ( X ) ) \rightarrow \mathrm { C o n } ( \mathrm { L C } ( Y ) ) . </m> if large cardinal axioms are supposed to be linearly ordered by consistency strength , then why does there seem to be no linear ordering on the axioms of the form <m> \mathrm { L C } ( X ) </m> ?
finding the asymptotic growth of the expected number of extreme points of the quadrant hull in <m> d </m> dimensions seems to be a well studied problem . interestingly , the solution appears to vary widely by the distribution . as previous posts point out -LRB- average size of extreme points of convex hull of <m> N </m> points -RRB- , the solution for drawing uniformly from convex bodies is <m> O ( l o g ^ { d - 1 } ( n ) ) </m> , whereas from a ball it is <m> O ( n ^ { \frac { d - 1 } { d + 1 } } ) </m> . the unbounded case has received attention as well , particularly for spherically symmetric distributions -LRB- for instance : https://www.jstor.org/stable/3214867?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents -RRB- . i am wondering about the case morally in the middle -- drawing random points from a halfplane . i have not been able to find any literature on this : what is the expected number of extremal points in the quadrant hull of <m> n </m> points drawn uniformly from a halfplane <m> H _ d </m> ?
for some time , i have been stuck to the problem to be described as follows . the -LRB- perhaps not so commonly known -RRB- facts given here are taken from r. e. edwards ' functional analysis -LRB- holt , rinehart and winston 1965 -RRB- pp. 578 − 589 . let <m> I = [ 0 , 1 ] </m> with the lebesgue measure , and consider real separable -LRB- not necessarily reflexive -RRB- banach spaces <m> E </m> with strong dual <m> F = E ' _ \beta </m> . a certain kind of '' <m> L ^ { + \infty } ( I , F ) </m> '' , <m> \Lambda ( I , E ' ) </m> , representing the dual of <m> L ^ 1 ( I , E ) </m> is constructed as follows . let <m> Y </m> be the vector space of a.e. bounded -LRB- i.e. bounded outside some set of measure zero -RRB- functions <m> g : I \to F </m> such that <m> { \rm e v } _ x \circ g : I \to \mathbb R </m> given by <m> t \mapsto ( g ( t ) ) ( x ) </m> is measurable for all <m> x \in E </m> . letting <m> N _ 0 </m> be the subspace formed by <m> g \in Y </m> vanishing a.e. , then <m> \Lambda ( I , E ' ) = Y / N _ 0 </m> becomes a banach space when we equip it with the essential supremum norm of representatives <m> g </m> of the equivalence classes <m> [ g ] = \{ g + h : h \in N _ 0 \} </m> . then a linear homeomorphism <m> \Lambda ( I , E ' ) \to ( L ^ 1 ( I , E ) ) ' _ \beta </m> is given by <m> [ g ] \mapsto \ell : [ f ] \mapsto \int _ I ( g \ . f ) </m> where <m> ( g \ . f ) ( t ) = ( g ( t ) ) ( f ( t ) ) </m> . the problem is now the following . since generally preduals are not unique , there may be different -LRB- separable -RRB- spaces <m> E </m> having linearly homeomorphic duals <m> F </m> . so , at least a priori , we can not invariantly define some space '' <m> \Lambda ( I , F ) </m> '' as a certain kind of '' <m> L ^ { + \infty } ( I , F ) </m> '' . according to this philip brooker 's answer , there are nonisomorphic separable spaces <m> C ( S ) </m> having isomorphic duals . one may then ask , whether -LRB- 1 -RRB- the corresponding spaces <m> \Lambda ( I , ( C ( S ) ) ' ) </m> are -LRB- isometrically -RRB- isomorpic or linearly homeomorphic , under the associated `` natural '' maps . further , the dual of <m> L ^ 1 ( I \times I ) </m> is represented by <m> L ^ { + \infty } ( I \times I ) </m> . since <m> L ^ 1 ( I \times I ) </m> is isomorphic to <m> L ^ 1 ( I , L ^ 1 ( I ) ) </m> , we see that <m> L ^ { + \infty } ( I \times I ) </m> is isomorphic to <m> \Lambda ( I , ( L ^ 1 ( I ) ) ' ) </m> . one may then ask , whether -LRB- 2 -RRB- there are separable banach spaces <m> E </m> not linearly homeomorphic to <m> L ^ 1 ( I ) </m> , but having dual linearly homeomorphic to <m> L ^ { + \infty } ( I ) </m> and <m> \Lambda ( I , E ' ) </m> not linearly homeomorphic to <m> L ^ { + \infty } ( I \times I ) </m> under the associated natural maps . so , there are two concrete questions -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- above . as an explanation of the phrase `` natural map '' above , i add the following . if <m> \ell _ 0 </m> is a linear homeomorphism <m> ( C ( S _ 1 ) ) ' _ \beta \to ( C ( S _ 2 ) ) ' _ \beta </m> , then the question is about whether a linear homeomorphism <m> \Lambda ( I , ( C ( S _ 1 ) ) ' ) \to \Lambda ( I , ( C ( S _ 2 ) ) ' ) </m> is given by <m> [ g ] \mapsto [ \ell _ 0 \circ g ] </m> . for the second question , if <m> \ell _ 0 </m> is a linear homeomorphism <m> E ' _ \beta \to L ^ { + \infty } ( I ) </m> , then the question is about whether a linear homeomorphism <m> \Lambda ( I , E ' ) \to L ^ { + \infty } ( I \times I ) </m> is given by <m> [ g ] \mapsto [ \hat g ] </m> where <m> [ \hat g ( t , \cdot ) ] = \ell _ 0 ( g ( t ) ) </m> for suitably chosen <m> \hat g </m> . i have above taken the attitude that the isomophism -LRB- or linear homeomorphism -RRB- class the space <m> \Lambda ( I , E ' ) </m> is not solely determined by that of <m> E ' _ \beta </m> but depends also on <m> E </m> . if someone knows the contrary to be true , i am gratefull for a reference or a proof . also possible couterexamples where for separable banach spaces <m> E , E _ 1 </m> with <m> E ' _ \beta </m> and <m> ( E _ 1 ) ' _ \beta </m> linearly homeomorphic but <m> \Lambda ( I , E ' ) </m> and <m> \Lambda ( I , E _ 1 ' ) </m> not , where the spaces <m> E , E _ 1 </m> are not some <m> C ( S ) </m> or <m> L ^ 1 ( I ) </m> as i suggested above , are wellcome . edited . -LRB- 25.5.2013 -RRB- the question -LRB- 1 -RRB- above is settled since in the case where <m> E = C ( S ) </m> with <m> S </m> a countable ordinal with the order topology has dual isomorphic to <m> \ell ^ { \, \, 1 } ( \mathbb N _ 0 ) </m> using pettis ' theorem and the dominated convergence theorem one can show that measurability of <m> I \owns t \mapsto g ( t ) ( x ) \in \mathbb R </m> for all <m> x \in E </m> implies -LRB- strong -RRB- measurability into <m> E _ \beta ^ { \prime } \, , </m> .
let <m> q _ 0 </m> be a prime and <m> q </m> = <m> q _ 0 ^ n </m> . let <m> a ( F _ q / F _ { q _ 0 } ) </m> denote any integer which is trace of frobenius over the field <m> F _ q </m> for some elliptic curve which can be defined over <m> F _ { q _ 0 } </m> . it is stated in mazur 's paper -LRB- rational isogenies of primes degree , inventiones mathematicae , 1978 -RRB- that <m> a ( F _ 3 ^ { 1 2 } / F _ 3 ) </m> = 658 , -1358 , +1458 . i can get only <m> \pm </m> 1458 or <m> \pm </m> 729 or 0 if i use the following thm . -LRB- it might be a simple answer . but , i do n't see that how 658 , - 1358 occurs -RRB- . theorem : let <m> q _ 0 </m> be a prime and <m> q </m> = <m> q _ 0 ^ n </m> . then there exists an elliptic curve <m> E </m> dened over <m> F _ q </m> such that the trace of the frobenius equals to <m> \beta </m> -LRB- <m> \beta </m> <m> \leq </m> <m> \lfloor 2 \sqrt { q } \rfloor </m> -RRB- if and only if one of the following cases occur : -LRB- i -RRB- <m> q _ 0 </m> does not divide <m> \beta </m> , -LRB- ii -RRB- . <m> q </m> is a square -LRB- i.e. <m> n </m> is even -RRB- and <m> \beta </m> = <m> \pm 2 \sqrt { q } </m> or <m> \beta </m> = <m> \pm \sqrt { q } </m> -LRB- <m> q _ 0 </m> <m> \not \equiv </m> 1 -LRB- mod 3 -RRB- -RRB- or <m> \beta </m> = 0 and -LRB- <m> q _ 0 </m> <m> \not \equiv </m> 1 -LRB- mod 4 -RRB- -RRB- , -LRB- iii -RRB- <m> q </m> is not a square -LRB- i.e. <m> n </m> is odd -RRB- and <m> \beta </m> = 0 or <m> \beta </m> = <m> \pm </m> <m> q _ 0 ^ { n + 1 / 2 } </m> and <m> q _ 0 </m> = 2,3 .

we know that <m> U ( N ) </m> can be embedded into <m> S U ( n + 1 ) </m> and that the quotient is isomorphic to complex projective space : <m> S U ( n + 1 ) / U ( n ) \simeq { \mathbb C P } ^ { n } . </m> we can split this process into two stages , first quotient <m> S U ( n + 1 ) </m> by <m> S U ( n ) </m> giving the sphere <m> S U ( n + 1 ) / S U ( n ) \simeq S ^ { 2 n + 1 } , </m> and then quotient <m> S ^ { 2 + 1 } </m> by <m> U ( 1 ) </m> to get <m> { \mathbb C P } ^ { n } </m> . i am curious about the analogue for the compact symplectic groups <m> S p ( n ) </m> . according to the hermitian symmetric space wikipedia page , <m> S p ( n ) / U ( n ) </m> is the space of complex structures on <m> \mathbb { H } ^ n </m> compatible with the inner product . if it helps , note that like <m> { \mathbb C P } ^ { n } </m> , this is an hermitian symmetric space , and a flag manifold . one can again split this quotient into a quotient by <m> S U ( N ) </m> , and a quotient by <m> U ( 1 ) </m> . question : what is the space <m> S p ( n ) / S U ( N ) </m> ? does it have a name ?
this question is motivated by joel david hamkins ' answer to gödel 's constructible universe in infinitary logics -LRB- a possible approach to hod problem -RRB- , in which he shows that , if we replace first-order definability by <m> \mathcal { L } _ { \infty \infty } </m> - definability in the definition of <m> L </m> , we wind up building all of <m> V </m> . this relies on using <m> \mathcal { L } _ { \infty \infty } ^ V </m> ; clearly if we take <m> \overline { L } _ { \alpha + 1 } = \{ A \subseteq \overline { L } _ \alpha : \exists \varphi \in \overline { L } _ \alpha \cap \mathcal { L } _ { \infty \infty } ( A = \varphi ^ { \overline { L } _ \alpha } ) \} , </m> we just wind up with <m> L </m> itself at the end . moreover , we also climb up <m> L </m> at about the same speed as in the usual construction , since if i have an infinitary formula in <m> L _ \alpha </m> , the subset of <m> L _ \alpha </m> it defines will show up in <m> L _ { \alpha + 1 7 } </m> -LRB- say -RRB- . a similar observation , however , seems to fail for second-order logic : if we interpret the second-order quantifiers as ranging over <m> L </m> , so that <m> \hat { L } _ { \alpha + 1 } = \{ X \subseteq \hat { L } _ \alpha : \exists \varphi \in \mathcal { L } _ { I I } ( L \models \text { " } \varphi ^ { \hat { L } _ \alpha } = A \text { " } ) \} , </m> then the only obvious upper bound on the <m> \hat { L } </m> - hierarchy is <m> \hat { L } _ { \alpha } \subseteq L _ \beta \implies \hat { L } _ { \alpha + 1 } \subseteq L _ { \vert \beta \vert ^ + } </m> -LRB- by condensation -RRB- ; and this is really a trivial observation . so in principle the <m> \hat { L } </m> - hierarchy could grow quite fast . my question is :
we embeds <m> G L _ n ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> in <m> G L _ { n + 1 } ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> by identifying <m> A \in G L _ n ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> with <m> \begin {pmatrix} A & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end {pmatrix} \in G L _ { n + 1 } ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> . let <m> G L _ \infty ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> be the direct limit -LRB- or the union if you like -RRB- of all <m> G L _ n ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> . then it is easy to see that the countable group <m> G L _ \infty ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> contains a copy of every finite group as one of its subgroups . my question is , given any <m> M > 0 </m> , does there exist a nilpotent infinite subgroup <m> H </m> of <m> G </m> , such that there exists a finite subgroup <m> K </m> of <m> H </m> , with <m> \lvert K \rvert > M </m> ? one can also ask the weaker question by replacing nilpotent with solvable .

while tinkering with numbers , i found <m> n = f ( x ) </m> where <m> n = \sigma ( \sigma ( n ) - n ) </m> and <m> x \neq p </m> where <m> p </m> is a mersenne prime exponent , but i need help input in regard to improving accuracy . first off , i thought i 'd try to explain how i got to this point , and please keep in mind that i am by no means a wizard at math , but i have a halfway decent understanding number theory and sequences due to my background as a programmer , so bear with me . as previously stated , i was tinkering with numbers ; specifically mersenne prime exponents , perfect numbers and powers of 2 . at some point i started to look at the relationship between perfect numbers and their binary representation , since it 's proven that all perfect numbers are pernicious . for example : <m> p = 2 : ~ ~ M _ p = 1 1 0 _ 2 \, \ p = 3 : ~ ~ M _ p = 1 1 1 0 0 _ 2 \, \ p = 5 : ~ ~ M _ p = 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 _ 2 \, \ p = 7 : ~ ~ M _ p = 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 _ 2 \, \ . . . </m> since all even perfect numbers are of this form , i started to investigate further , looking at the powers of two these numbers represent . after making a myriad of different calculations , i came across a correlation between mersenne prime exponents , mersenne primes and perfect numbers that was previously unknown to me : <m> B _ n = \binom { B _ { n \over 2 } , { { n \over 2 } \mid 2 } } { n + 1 } </m> explanation of <m> B _ n </m> : <m> B _ n </m> is equal to <m> B _ n \over 2 </m> while <m> n </m> is divisible by <m> 2 </m> else <m> B _ n = n + 1 </m> expressed as a python snippet : def b -LRB- n -RRB- : if n % 2 == 0 : return b -LRB- n/2 -RRB- else : return n +1
-LRB- this is a revision of a question i asked on mse . -RRB- let <m> M </m> be a smooth manifold of dimension <m> n </m> , and let <m> \omega </m> be a differential form of degree <m> p </m> on <m> M </m> . then we have -LRB- i 'm pretty sure -RRB- the following theorem :
question : under which conditions on <m> A , B \in \mathbb { R } ^ { N \times N } </m> is the function <m> f : \mathbb { R } ^ N \mapsto \mathbb { R } ^ N </m> , <m> f ( v ) = A [ v ] _ + + B [ - v ] _ + </m> surjective ? here <m> [ . ] _ + </m> is an elementwise rectifier , <m> [ x ] _ + = \begin {cases} x & \mbox { i f } x > 0 , \\ 0 & \mbox { o t h e r w i s e } . \end {cases} </m> remarks : in the simple case that <m> B = 0 </m> the image of <m> f ( v ) </m> is the conic hull <m> \operatorname { c o n e } ( S ) </m> of <m> S = \left \{ a _ i \, | \, i = 1 , \dots , N \right \} </m> where <m> a _ i </m> are the columns of <m> A </m> . clearly , for square <m> A </m> the conic hull can never span <m> \mathbb { R } ^ N </m> , and so <m> f </m> is not surjective in that case . the addition of the second factor <m> B </m> makes the whole problem more interesting . observe that either a column <m> a _ i </m> or the corresponding column <m> b _ i </m> can be active at the same time , but not both . then define <m> C _ i = \left \{ a _ i , b _ i \right \} </m> and <m> M = C _ 1 \times \dots \times C _ N </m> as the cartesian product of the column pairs . in this case the image of <m> f </m> is the union of conic hulls over points in <m> M </m> , i. e. <m> \bigcup \limits _ { m \in M } \operatorname { c o n e } \left ( \left \{ m _ i \, | \, i = 1 , \dots , N \right \} \right ) . </m> in general it is an np-hard problem to determine whether a union of cones covers a convex set <m> D </m> -LSB- 1 -RSB- , but the problem considered here exhibits much more structure . ideally , i would like to infer conditions on <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> under which <m> f </m> is surjective , i.e. under which the coverage of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ N </m> is complete . any hints or comments are much appreciated ! -LSB- 1 -RSB- on a cone covering problem , https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~elbassio/pub/unionofcones.pdf
i asked this question on math stackexchange recently but the only useful comment i got was that this could be a good question for math overflow . here it goes : consider the gaussian <m> G ( x ) : = e ^ { - x ^ 2 } </m> on the real line , and localize it to the region <m> | x | \sim 2 ^ k </m> by multiplying it by an appropriate smooth cut-off . more precisely , take <m> \phi \in C _ 0 ^ \infty ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> supported in the region <m> \{ x \in \mathbb { R } : \frac { 1 } { 2 } < | x | \leq 2 \} </m> such that <m> 0 \leq \phi \leq 1 , </m> and let <m> \phi _ k ( x ) : = \phi ( 2 ^ { - k } x ) </m> . consider : <m> G _ k ( x ) : = \phi _ k ( x ) G ( x ) . </m> it is straightforward to check that <m> \| G _ k \| _ { L ^ 1 } \lesssim 2 ^ k e ^ { - 4 ^ k } </m> , which tends -LRB- very quickly -RRB- to <m> 0 </m> as <m> k \rightarrow \infty </m> . also , using young 's convolution inequality one can easily show that <m> \| \widehat { G _ k } \| _ { L ^ 1 } \leq \| \phi \| _ 1 \| G \| _ 1 </m> , but this gives no decay in terms of <m> k </m> . my question is : does <m> \| \widehat { G _ k } \| _ { L ^ 1 } </m> decay as <m> k \rightarrow \infty </m> ? if so , how fast ? can you prove sharp bounds -LRB- in <m> k </m> -RRB- ? thank you .
frequently , i see a statment of the result in reference that a finite dimensional alexandrov spaces is locally a product <m> \mathbb { R } ^ m \times c o n e </m> . it seems that this result comes from perelman 's paper `` elements on morse theory on alexandrov spaces '' . in fact perelman proved that a finite dimensional alexandrov spaces is an mcs-spaces -LRB- mcs = multiple conic singularities -RRB- . how it imples that result ? maybe it is easy , but i do n't know how . def . a metrizable space <m> M _ n </m> is a mcs-space of dimension <m> n </m> if , for each <m> x \in M _ n </m> , there exists a neighborhood <m> U </m> of <m> x </m> and an compact mcs-space <m> M _ { n - 1 } </m> of dimension <m> n 1 </m> , such that there exists a homeomorphism from the cone of <m> M _ { n - 1 } </m> to <m> U </m> such that it sends the cone point to <m> x </m> . here , we regard the case of -1 dimension as the empty set and its cone as a single point . by the way , in the remark of the definition of mcs-space in the paper above . let subset <m> A ^ n </m> consists points <m> x \in M _ n </m> whose conic nbhd admits a topological splitting <m> \mathbb { R } ^ m \times C ( M _ { n - m - 1 } ) </m> -LRB- here <m> C ( M _ { n - m - 1 } ) </m> is a cone over an <m> n - 1 </m> dimensional mcs-space -RRB- for all <m> m \leq l </m> . perelman said that <m> A ^ l </m> is an <m> l </m> - manifold . i do n't know why . in my opinion , <m> A ^ l - A ^ { l - 1 } </m> is an <m> l </m> - manifold but not <m> A ^ l </m> . the questions overlap https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1130005/ . since no one answered there , i post it here . thanks !
context : i am currently reading through the freely available lecture notes from tristan riviere -LRB- here -RRB- on the applicability of integration by compensation in the analysis of various geometrically motivated pdes . i have attempted to find something in the vast literature to the following effect : suppose <m> u : D ^ 2 \rightarrow \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> , <m> u \in W ^ { 1 , 2 } </m> , <m> \Delta u = f ( u , \nabla u ) = 2 H \partial _ x u \times \partial _ y u </m> . then <m> u \in C ^ { 0 , \alpha } ( D ' ) \rightarrow u \in C ^ \infty ( D ' ' ) , </m> where <m> D ' ' \subset \subset D ' \subset \subset D </m> . in other words , an interior estimate . with the little regularity on hand , it appears to be very difficult . i find this surprising because most of the time , proving the hölder regularity of the solution is the ` most difficult ' part . i have the feeling that i am missing an obvious reference or a well-known folklore argument . showing the hölder continuity of the solution relies on deriving a morrey-type estimate with the help of the wente lemma . in the process of doing this , one also shows that <m> \sup _ { \rho < 1 / 2 , p \in B _ { 1 / 2 } ( 0 ) } \rho ^ { - \alpha } \int _ { B _ \rho ( p ) } | \Delta u | </m> is bounded . this implies that <m> f \in \mathcal { H } ^ 1 </m> . i just include this extra detail in case this question fits into a general framework of optimal interior regularity for poisson 's equation on a disk when the right hand side is hardy . -LRB- this is the reason for the earlier form of my question . -RRB- can anybody help ?
i am trying to find <m> K _ 0 ( A G ) </m> for <m> G </m> cyclic of prime order . according to a paper i have , tom dieck and petrie 's paper `` geometric modules over the burnside ring '' -LRB- 1978 -RRB- shows <m> K _ 0 ( A G ) = \mathbb { Z } \oplus \mathbb { Z } / ( ( p - 1 ) / 2 ) </m> for <m> p \geq 3 </m> , but i can not find this anywhere in the paper . can somebody either explain where this is in the paper or point me to another source ?
let <m> a , b </m> be algebraic irrationals . are there conjectures or unconditional results about the algebraic independence of <m> a ^ a </m> and <m> b ^ b </m> ? probably schanuel 's conjecture is related , maybe only <m> \log { a } , \log { b } </m> and/or <m> a , b </m> are linearly independent over the rationals .
this question has a trivial starting point : if the open sets of <m> \mathbb { R } </m> were closed under countable intersection , the euclidean topology would be discrete because for all <m> x \in \mathbb { R } </m> we have <m> \{ x \} = \bigcap \big \{ ( x - \frac { 1 } { n } , x + \frac { 1 } { n } ) : n \in \mathbb { N } \setminus \{ 0 \} \big \} </m> . question . is there a connected <m> T _ 2 </m> - space <m> ( X , \tau ) </m> with <m> X </m> uncountable such that for all countable sets <m> { \cal C } \subseteq \tau </m> we have <m> \bigcap { \cal C } \in \tau </m> ?
i would like to know what is the most general form of the gauss-bonnet theorem in the plane for curves . it is well known for that for any piecewise <m> C ^ 2 </m> simply connected curve with corners , one has <m> \int _ { \partial \Omega } \kappa ( y ) d S ( y ) = 2 \pi </m> , where <m> \kappa </m> denotes the curvature of the boundary <m> \partial \Omega </m> . this formula continues to hold for any curve for which <m> \hat n \cdot ( 1 , 0 ) </m> -LRB- for instance -RRB- defines a <m> B V </m> function . question : i would like to know to what extent this generalizes . for example , if <m> \Omega </m> is a simply connected , compact set in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> whose boundary has finite length and has generalized curvature <m> \kappa \in L ^ { \infty } ( \partial \Omega ) </m> , does it hold that <m> \int _ { \partial \Omega } \kappa ( y ) d S ( y ) = 2 \pi </m> ? if not , are there counter examples in the plane where this fails ?

my question arises from a construction i gave in my recent answer to a question of alexander pruss concerning large families of independent non-measurable sets of reals . in that argument , using the continuum hypothesis and the existence of a thick kurepa tree <m> T </m> , i produced a family of <m> 2 ^ { \frak c } </m> many vitali sets <m> \{ \ A _ s \mid s \in [ T ] \ \} </m> , which was almost disjoint in the sense that <m> A _ s \cap A _ t </m> was countable whenever <m> s \neq t </m> . the only aspect of the vitali relation that was used in the construction was that the vitali equivalence classes -LRB- equivalence under rational translation -RRB- are countably infinite . thus , the construction proves : theorem . if the ch holds and there is a thick kurepa tree , then for every partition of <m> \mathbb { R } </m> into countably infinite sets , there is an almost-disjoint family of selectors of size <m> 2 ^ { \frak c } </m> . by almost-disjoint here , i mean that any two distinct elements of the family have countable intersection ; by selector , i mean that each set in the family has exactly one element from each equivalence class ; and by a partition into countably infinite sets , i mean that we have an equivalence relation on <m> \mathbb { R } </m> with every equivalence class countably infinite . to prove the theorem , simply label the nodes on the <m> \alpha ^ { t h } </m> level of <m> T </m> with distinct members of the <m> \alpha ^ { t h } </m> equivalence class in the partition . being thick , the tree has <m> 2 ^ { \frak c } </m> many branches , each of which provides a selector , and any two such selectors can agree only up to some countable height in the tree , where those branches separate . my question is whether i really needed those set-theoretic assumptions in order to make the conclusion . question . how much can one weaken the hypotheses of the theorem and still prove the conclusion ? for example , can we drop the thick kurepa tree assumption ? can we omit ch ? can we prove it in zfc ? can one show the consistency with zfc of a counterexample ?
as the title says . can we determine all the integral points on elliptic curves of the form <m> y ^ 2 = x ^ 3 + p x </m> for a prime <m> p </m> ? if yes , can someone explain me how ? a good reference would also be sufficient .
let <m> P </m> be a prime ideal of a cohen-macaulay ring <m> R </m> . then is the sequence <m> \operatorname { d e p t h } ( R / P ^ n ) </m> eventually constant ?
on a 3-manifold <m> Y </m> , oriented 2-plane fields <m> \xi </m> are oriented rank-2 subbundles of <m> T Y </m> . denote the set of such -LRB- up to homotopy -RRB- by <m> \Theta = \pi _ 0 \lbrace \xi \rbrace </m> . what is an explicit canonical map <m> \Theta \to \mathbb { Z } _ 2 </m> ? in particular , i want to see the canonical mod-2 grading on seiberg-witten-floer homology , but the classical text of kronheimer-mrowka does n't mention it in terms of 2-plane fields . they construct an isomorphism of <m> \Theta </m> with some abstract set <m> \mathbb { J } </m> based upon `` configuration points '' <m> [ a ] </m> , and then a canonical map <m> \mathbb { J } \to \mathbb { Z } _ 2 </m> by assigning to <m> [ a ] </m> an operator and taking its index mod-2 . these two maps are tough enough on their own , so i can not see what it looks like on 2-plane fields ... plus , there should be some purely topological partition of <m> \Theta </m> into two subsets . otherwise , perhaps it can be done knowing that oriented 2-plane fields are equivalent to 1-forms of length 1 , and are also equivalent to pairs <m> ( \mathfrak { s } , \phi ) </m> where <m> \mathbb { s } </m> is a spin-c structure and <m> \phi </m> is a unit-length spinor . this should then be related to taking a 4-manifold <m> X </m> such that <m> \partial X = Y </m> and with a spin-c structure <m> \mathfrak { s } _ X </m> which extends <m> \mathfrak { s } </m> .
the stable real cohomology of <m> S L _ n ( \mathbb Z ) </m> was computed by borel : it is given by <m> \mathbb R [ z _ i \mid i = 5 , 9 , 1 3 , \cdots ] </m> with <m> z _ i </m> in degree <m> i </m> . one may wonder whether the pull back of the stable class <m> z _ i </m> on <m> S L ( \mathbb Z ) </m> to <m> S L _ n ( \mathbb Z ) </m> for some finite <m> n </m> is non-zero . that is , whether <m> \iota _ n ^ * z _ i = 0 \in H ^ i ( S L _ n ( \mathbb Z ) , \mathbb R ) </m> for <m> \iota _ n \colon S L _ n ( \mathbb Z ) \to S L ( \mathbb Z ) </m> . borel 's proof also gives a real cohomological stability result and hence gives a range of <m> n </m> 's for which this is true , but in 1978 ronnie lee announced a proof that <m> z _ i </m> is non-zero as long as <m> i < 2 n - 3 </m> , a much larger range of <m> n </m> 's than what can be deduced from borel 's proof . his paper says

kazhdan-lusztig theory gives a correspondence between irreducibles of the affine hecke algebra for a simply connected linear algebraic group <m> G </m> and certain homological data extracted from the steinberg variety -LRB- for <m> q </m> not a root of unity -RRB- . i want to see this correspondence explicitly for <m> S L _ 2 </m> by -LRB- 1 -RRB- looking at generators and relations for the hecke algebra <m> H </m> and -LRB- 2 -RRB- looking at the geometric data . my problem is that for the 1-dimensional representations i ca n't get them to match up . i expect it 's a somewhat silly error but i ca n't find it , in any case . edit : the sources i 'm relying on criss/ginzburg -LRB- paper version here : http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9802004 -RRB- . the affine hecke algebra in this case i think is some deformation of the group algebra of the affine weyl group . on the geometric side it 's <m> G \times \mathbb { C } ^ * </m> - equivariant k-theory on the steinberg variety . method 1 : the affine hecke algebra for <m> S L _ 2 </m> is an algebra <m> H </m> with generators <m> T , X , X ^ { - 1 } </m> and relations <m> ( T + 1 ) ( T - q ) = 0 </m> <m> T X ^ { - 1 } - X ^ 1 T = ( 1 - q ) X ^ 1 </m> <m> X X ^ { - 1 } = X ^ { - 1 } X = 1 </m> it 's not too hard to compute the one-dimensional representations . for central character <m> \sqrt { q } + 1 / \sqrt { q } </m> -LRB- the scalar which <m> X + X ^ { - 1 } </m> , the generator for <m> \mathcal { O } ( T / / W ) </m> , acts by -RRB- , one has the representations <m> ( T , X ) \mapsto ( - 1 , 1 / \sqrt { q } ) , ( q , \sqrt { q } ) </m> and for central character <m> - \sqrt { q } - 1 / \sqrt { q } </m> <m> ( T , X ) \mapsto ( - 1 , - 1 / \sqrt { q } ) , ( q , - \sqrt { q } ) </m> in total , giving four representations , two for each central character . method 2 : we should be able to read off the irreducibles by kazhdan-lusztig theory . namely , for generic <m> q </m> , fix <m> g </m> with desired central character , and take the <m> g </m> - fixed locus of the springer resolution <m> \mu ^ g : \tilde { \mathcal { N } } ^ g \rightarrow \mathcal { N } ^ g </m> . the total borel-moore homology of <m> \mu ^ { g , - 1 } ( x ) </m> , choosing representatives <m> x </m> in each <m> C ( g ) </m> - orbit of <m> \mathcal { N } ^ g </m> , is a representation of <m> H </m> specialized at this central character . for <m> g = \pm \text { d i a g } ( \sqrt { q } , 1 / \sqrt { q } ) </m> one has <m> \mathcal { N } ^ g = \mathbb { A } ^ 1 </m> the nilpotent radical of the usual borel . it has two <m> C ( g ) </m> orbits : <m> x = 0 </m> and <m> x \in \mathbb { A } ^ 1 - 0 </m> . -LRB- 1 -RRB- for <m> x = 0 </m> , the fiber has two-dimensional homology . the double centralizer <m> C ( g , 0 ) = T </m> , which is connected , so we do n't have to worry about isotypical components of <m> A ( g , 0 ) = C ( g , 0 ) / C ( g , 0 ) ^ \circ </m> . -LRB- 2 -RRB- for <m> x = \left ( \begin {array} { c c } 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end {array} \right ) </m> , the fiber is a point , so we have a one-dimensional homology . the component group is n't relevant here . so here , we only find two 1-dim representations , one for each central character . i must have misunderstood something .
frohlich and kerler classify categories with <m> S U ( 2 ) _ k </m> fusion rules and kazdhan-wenzl expand this to <m> S U ( N ) _ k </m> categories . in both cases , unless i am missing something , the classification are determined by the dimension of the generating object which seems to imply that there 's a hidden pivotal structure lurking about . is this true ? if so , how does the classification refine down to the fusion level ?
i 'm reading the paper classification of marginally trapped lorentzian flat surfaces in <m> \mathbb { E } ^ 4 _ 2 </m> and its applications to biharmonic surfaces by b. y. chen . summarizing it quickly : he first proves a rigidity theorem for marginally trapped flat lorentzian surfaces in <m> \Bbb R ^ 4 _ 2 </m> , and then uses it to give an analogous result for marginally trapped bi-harmonic surfaces in <m> \Bbb R ^ 4 _ 2 </m> . more precisely , the proof of theorem 5.1 starts by proving that bi-harmonic surfaces are flat , and then calling the previous result . however , his proof confuses me a little . he takes pseudo-orthonormal frames <m> ( e _ 1 , e _ 2 ) </m> and <m> ( e _ 3 , e _ 4 ) </m> , tangent and normal to the surface , with all of them lightlike and <m> \langle e _ 1 , e _ 2 \rangle = \langle e _ 3 , e _ 4 \rangle = - 1 </m> , ok . but he assumes from the start that <m> \nabla _ { e _ i } e _ j = 0 </m> for <m> i = 1 , 2 </m> . most likely i 'm missing something very simple , but as far as i knew , that last condition can only be assumed once we know that the surface is flat . without this , i can not conclude equation -LRB- 5.11 -RRB- as he does . also , it appears he has some typos in -LRB- 5.9 -RRB- , and it would n't make any sense to introduce notations <m> \omega </m> , <m> \omega _ 1 </m> and <m> \omega _ 2 </m> , since they all would be zero from the get go . the proof seems circular . help ?
let <m> x </m> be a formal -LRB- or small , since the function is analytic -RRB- variable , and consider the power series <m> A ( x ) = \frac { x } { 1 - e ^ { - x } } = \sum _ { m = 0 } ^ \infty \left ( - \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { ( - x ) ^ n } { ( n + 1 ) ! } \right ) ^ m = 1 + \frac 1 2 x + \frac 1 { 1 2 } x ^ 2 + 0 x ^ 3 - \frac 1 { 7 2 0 } x ^ 4 + \dots </m> where i might have made an arithmetic error in expanding it out .
this question is meant to be viewed under moderate large cardinal hypotheses , e.g. , enough to ensure <m> \aleph _ 1 ^ { L [ x ] } < \aleph _ 1 </m> for all reals <m> x </m> . in analogy with the -LRB- well-developed -RRB- theory of countable borel equivalence relations , what can be said about countable <m> \mathbf \Sigma ^ 1 _ 2 </m> -LRB- or <m> \mathbf \Delta ^ 1 _ 3 </m> , whatever make the most sense -RRB- equivalence relations ? a natural example of such an equivalence relation is relative constructability , i.e. , <m> x \equiv _ c y </m> if and only if <m> L [ x ] = L [ y ] </m> for reals <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> . specifically , i 'm looking for :
not sure if this is the right place to ask this , but the paper i am reading seems to be too specialised for mathstack -LRB- if you do not agree , pleas let me know and i will take down this question -RRB- i am reading the paper ` the tits alternative for <m> \operatorname { O u t } ( F _ n ) </m> i : dynamics of exponentially growing automorphisms ' by bestvina , feighn and handel . in it , the following lemma occurs :
i am stuck trying to prove a problem that seems obvious : namely , given a monic polynomial with integral coefficients <m> f ( x ) = x ^ n + a _ 1 x ^ { n - 1 } + \ldots + a _ 1 x + a _ 0 , </m> <m> a _ i \in \mathbb { Z } </m> , is it true that no pair of real roots lie strictly between any two adjacent integers ? i was able to prove it when <m> n = 2 </m> and i have also sketched a proof for some <m> n </m> that if such roots exist , then they will not be rational . does this boil down to a nontrivial question or am i missing something ? thank you .
i 'm new to this forum i normally post on stackoverflow . my question is related to combinatorics and subsets . here is an example : <m> N = 6 </m> , <m> X = 5 </m> , <m> Y = 5 </m> ; the set <m> \{ 0 , 1 , 6 , 3 1 , 1 0 8 , 3 6 6 \} </m> has the following property : however you take a subset in group of <m> 5 </m> with repetition of at most <m> 5 </m> the sum of that set will be unique among all others . -LRB- <m> \{ 3 1 , 3 1 , 3 1 , 3 1 , 3 1 \} </m> , <m> \{ 0 , 1 , 3 1 , 1 0 8 , 1 0 8 \} </m> are two random subset -RRB- i 've computed this set by brute force , now i 'm asking if there are relationships between <m> N </m> , <m> X </m> , <m> Y </m> -LRB- numbers , set size , repetition -RRB- and the distance between the resulting numbers in the set . and i 'd ask whether there 's any trick to compute this set without burning a cpu . important : the set of numbers must be the one with the smallest numbers having that property , otherwise would be trivial to find one . starting from the previous set example you can not decrease any of the number in the set <m> \{ 0 , 1 , 6 , 3 1 , 1 0 8 , 3 6 6 \} </m> without breaking that property . so lets call it `` the minimum value set '' with that property . the trivial one where <m> N </m> = <m> 6 </m> <m> X </m> = <m> 5 </m> <m> Y </m> = <m> 5 </m> can be found setting the first number of the set <m> N _ { 0 } </m> = <m> 0 </m> then <m> N _ { i } </m> = <m> 5 * N _ { i - 1 } + 1 </m> giving <m> \{ 0 , 1 , 6 , 3 1 , 1 5 6 , 7 8 1 \} </m> . thanks
the category of <m> C ^ { * } </m> algebras is denoted by <m> \mathcal { A } </m> . is there a functor <m> \mathcal { F } </m> on <m> \mathcal { A } </m> which send each object <m> A \in \mathcal { A } </m> to its center <m> Z ( A ) </m> . in the other words , can we extend the maping <m> A \mapsto Z ( A ) </m> on objects to a functor on this category ?
in the wake of my curiosity on this kind of things , i was thinking if there is an example of a non - -LRB- locally cyclic -RRB- abelian group whose automorphism group is cyclic not of order <m> 2 </m> . every example i know -LRB- of a non-cyclic group -RRB- with cyclic automorphism group lead me to <m> \mathbb { Z } _ 2 </m> . is it known if such examples do exist ?

if <m> f </m> is a continuous map from the <m> n </m> - ball <m> B </m> into itself , the brouwer fixed point theorem guarantees a fixed point . what if we assume that <m> f </m> maps <m> B </m> into all <m> R ^ n </m> , and <m> f ( B ) </m> contains <m> B </m> ? for the one-dimensional case it is still true that such <m> f </m> has a fixed point . does this property also hold for higher dimensions ?
so , in learning about category <m> \mathcal { O } </m> representations of a semisimple lie algebra <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> , i 've come across two natural kinds of subcategories , and i think i 'm confused about their structure and the relationship between them . -LRB- in particular , if they are equivalent or not -RRB- . fix <m> \lambda \in \mathfrak { h } ^ { * } </m> and let <m> \chi _ { \lambda } : Z ( \mathfrak { g } ) \rightarrow \mathbb { C } </m> denote the corresponding central character -LRB- <m> Z ( \mathfrak { g } ) </m> denoting the center of <m> U \mathfrak { g } </m> -RRB- type 1 : modules <m> M </m> such that <m> ( z - \chi _ { \lambda } ( z ) ) \cdot m = 0 </m> for all <m> m \in M </m> , <m> z \in Z ( \mathfrak { g } ) </m> . let 's call this <m> \text { M o d } _ { \mathcal { O } } ( \mathfrak { g } , \lambda ) </m> type 2 : modules <m> M </m> such that <m> ( z - \chi _ { \lambda } ( z ) ) ^ { n } \cdot m = 0 </m> for all <m> m \in M </m> , <m> z \in Z ( \mathfrak { g } ) </m> , where <m> n </m> is an integer possibly depending on <m> z </m> and <m> m </m> . let 's call this <m> \mathcal { O } _ { \lambda } </m> . now one clear reason to prefer the <m> \mathcal { O } _ { \lambda } </m> is that category <m> \mathcal { O } </m> is a direct sum of these subcategories . additionally , if <m> L \in \mathcal { O } _ { \lambda } </m> is simple , it 's projective cover will also be in <m> \mathcal { O } _ { \lambda } </m> , but not necessarily in <m> \text { M o d } _ { \mathcal { O } } ( \mathfrak { g } , \lambda ) </m> . but it seems like , in some cases , these categories should be equivalent ? for simplicity , let <m> \lambda = 0 </m> . if i 'm understanding correctly : 1 . beilinson-bernstein says that there is an equivalence of categories : <m> \text { M o d } _ { \mathcal { O } } ( \mathfrak { g } , 0 ) \cong \text { M o d } _ { B } ( D _ { X } ) </m> , where the second thing is weakly <m> B </m> - equivariant <m> D </m> - modules on the flag variety <m> X </m> . 2 . riemann-hilbert says that there is an equivalence <m> \text { M o d } _ { B } ( D _ X ) \cong \mathcal { P } _ { B } ( X ) </m> , the second category being perverse sheaves on <m> X </m> whose cohomology is constant along <m> B </m> - orbits . 3 . in the bgs paper on koszul duality , it is claimed that <m> D ^ { b } ( \mathcal { O } _ { 0 } ) \cong D ^ { b } _ { B } ( X ) </m> , the latter being the bounded derived category of constructible sheaves on <m> X </m> whose cohomology is constant along <m> B </m> - orbits , and this congruence respects the <m> t - </m> structures giving <m> \mathcal { O } _ { 0 } \cong \mathcal { P } _ { B } ( X ) </m> . is this all correct ? if it is , it would seem to establish an equivalence <m> \mathcal { O } _ { 0 } \cong \text { M o d } _ { \mathcal { O } } ( \mathfrak { g } , 0 ) </m> . which seems plausible , but also somewhat strange , since one is a strict subcategory of the other -LRB- not that that by itself would imply non-equivalence . . -RRB- . and even trying the simplest case , <m> \mathfrak { s l } _ 2 </m> , i am unable to realize this equivalence , for example , the category <m> \text { M o d } _ { \mathcal { O } } ( \mathfrak { s l } _ 2 , 0 ) </m> only seems to have four indecomposables -LRB- since it does n't have the projective cover of <m> L ( - 2 ) </m> -RRB- .
if <m> X </m> is a compact oriented surface in a 4-dimensional oriented manifold <m> M </m> , then the self-intersection number <m> X ^ 2 </m> of <m> X </m> is given by the integral over <m> X </m> of the euler class of the normal bundle . in the case of <m> C P ^ 1 </m> embedded in <m> C P ^ 2 </m> , the normal bundle is isomorphic to the hopf bundle , therefore <m> X ^ 2 </m> can be obtained calculating the first chern number of the hopf fibration -LRB- or equivalently the euler number of its realization -RRB- . it is possible to have circle bundles on <m> C P ^ 1 </m> with higher chern number by taking the quotient of the total space of the hopf fibration by the action generated by <m> ( z ^ 1 , z ^ 2 ) \mapsto ( z ^ 1 \exp ( i 2 \pi / k ) , z ^ 2 \exp ( i 2 \pi / k ) ) </m> . are these bundles the normal bundles of some embedding of <m> C P ^ 1 </m> in a 4-dimensional manifold ? if yes , is it possible to describe the embedding explicitly ? is there a deeper relation between the hopf bundle and the normal bundle of <m> C P ^ 1 </m> embedded in <m> C P ^ 2 </m> or do they just happen to be the same ?

consider the scalar elliptic equation of divergence form <m> d i v ( ( 1 + a ) \nabla \pi ) = d i v F \ \ i n \ \ R ^ 3 , </m> where <m> a </m> is a schwartz function with <m> 1 + a \geq c = c o n s t > 0 </m> , <m> F = ( F _ 1 , F _ 2 , F _ 3 ) </m> is a vector-valued schwartz function . now can we give a counterexample to show that for <m> 1 < p < \infty , p \neq 2 </m> , the solution map <m> F \mapsto \nabla \pi </m> is not bounded on <m> L ^ p </m> , namely , there does not hold <m> \| \nabla \pi \| _ { L ^ p } \leq C \| F \| _ { L ^ p } . </m> let 's give a remark . denote by <m> Q = \nabla ( - \Delta ) ^ { - 1 } d i v </m> , a <m> C - Z </m> singular integral operator on <m> L ^ p </m> , then <m> ( 1 + a ) \nabla \pi = [ a , Q ] \nabla \pi + Q F , </m> where <m> [ a , Q ] \nabla \pi = a Q \nabla \pi - Q ( a \nabla \pi ) </m> is a commutator . by r. r. coifman , r. rochberg , and guido weiss , factorization theorems for hardy spaces in several variables , ann . of math . -LRB- 2 -RRB- 103 -LRB- 1976 -RRB- , no. 3 , 611 -- 635 , the commutator operator <m> [ a , Q ] </m> is bounded on <m> L ^ p </m> if and only if <m> a \in B M O </m> <m> \| [ a , Q ] \nabla \pi \| _ { L ^ p } \leq C \| a \| _ { B M O } \| \nabla \pi \| _ { L ^ p } . </m> thus if <m> \| a \| _ { B M O } </m> is sufficiently small , then the gradient estimate is valid . but what happens if we remove the smallness condition for <m> a </m> ?
anyone with any ideas on this one ? mathematica and matlab ca n't do it . <m> \int _ 0 ^ \infty \frac { \sin ( a y ) \coth ( y ) } { ( 1 + 9 y ^ 2 ) ^ 2 } d y </m> here coth is the hyperbolic cotangent , and a is a positive parameter which will figure in the answer . it 's giving me fits . greg

i have been thinking about some set that is equidistributed modulo <m> q </m> , uniformly in <m> q </m> in some sense . i was starting to think this particular condition , which i describe below , is too strong and that i am starting to doubt if any such set even exists . however , i have n't been able to prove no such set exists . i was wondering if someone could tell me how to prove that such set does not exist -LRB- or that does exist -RRB- . i would also appreciate any input or discussion on whether such set exists or not . it would be great if i could get a better understanding ! thank you very much ! let <m> \gamma > \theta > 0 </m> , and some <m> \epsilon > 0 </m> small . let <m> B \subseteq \mathbb { N } </m> and <m> B \cap [ 1 , X ] \sim X ^ { \gamma } </m> . suppose given any <m> q \in \mathbb { N } </m> and any partition of the residue class modulo <m> q </m> , <m> \{ J _ l \} _ { l = 1 } ^ L </m> , such that <m> | J _ l | X ^ { \gamma } / q > X ^ { \epsilon } </m> , we have <m> \sum _ { l = 1 } ^ L | \ \# \{ u \in B : u \leq X , u \equiv J _ l ( \text { m o d } q ) \} - ( | J _ l | X ^ { \gamma } ) / q \ | \ll X ^ { \gamma - \theta } . </m> i am wondering does such a set <m> B </m> exist ? if <m> J = \{ r _ 1 , . . , r _ k \} </m> , by <m> u \equiv J ( \text { m o d } q ) </m> , i mean <m> u \equiv r _ j ( \text { m o d } q ) </m> for some <m> j \in \{ 1 , . . . , k \} </m> . thanks !
borho in this paper showed that a sheet -LRB- i.e. a suitable union of adjoint orbits of the same dimension -RRB- in a complex semisimple lie algebra <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> is classified by a pair <m> ( \mathfrak { l } , O ) </m> where <m> \mathfrak { l } </m> is a levi subalgebra of <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> and <m> O </m> is a rigid nilpotent orbit of <m> \mathfrak { l } </m> . how does the story go in the case of a sheet in the corresponding group <m> G </m> ? i guess i need to replace the levi algebra with a pseudo-levi group . i 'd appreciate if you could suggest a reference to look at .
let <m> \mu </m> be the well-known mobius function . question : are the hankel-type determinants <m> \det [ \mu ( i + j - 1 ) ] _ { 1 \le i , j \le n } \ \ \text { a n d } \ \ \det [ \mu ( i + j ) ^ 2 ] _ { 1 \le i , j \le n } </m> always nonzero ? it seems that the answer is positive -LRB- see http://oeis.org/a228548 and http://oeis.org/a228549 for some data -RRB- but i 'm unable to prove it .
it is well known that given an operator <m> T : \ell _ \infty \to \ell _ \infty </m> such that <m> T x = 0 </m> for each <m> x \in c _ 0 </m> there exists an infinite subset <m> M </m> of the positive integers so that <m> T x = 0 </m> for each <m> x \in \ell _ \infty ( M ) </m> . see theorem 2.5.4 in the book on banach spaces by albiac and kalton . i am interested in a version of this result for <m> T : \ell _ \infty ( \Gamma ) \to \ell _ \infty ( \Gamma ) </m> when <m> \Gamma </m> is uncountable . from <m> T x = 0 </m> for each <m> x \in c _ 0 ( \Gamma ) </m> i would like to derive the existence of a subset <m> \Gamma ' </m> of <m> \Gamma </m> so that <m> T x = 0 </m> for each <m> x \in \ell _ \infty ( \Gamma ' ) </m> with card -LRB- <m> \Gamma ' </m> -RRB- = card -LRB- <m> \Gamma </m> -RRB- , or at least with <m> \Gamma ' </m> uncountable . -LRB- <m> Q _ 1 </m> -RRB- is this result true ? to extend the argument in the proof of the countable case , i need the existence of a family <m> ( \Gamma _ i ) _ { i \in I } </m> with card <m> ( I ) > </m> card <m> ( \Gamma ) </m> of almost disjoint subsets -LRB- <m> \Gamma _ i \cap \Gamma _ j </m> finite for <m> i \neq j </m> -RRB- of <m> \Gamma </m> with card <m> ( \Gamma _ i ) = </m> card <m> ( \Gamma ) </m> for each <m> i </m> , or at least with all the <m> \Gamma _ i </m> uncountable . -LRB- <m> Q _ 2 </m> -RRB- is it possible to find such a family , at least with some restrictions on card -LRB- <m> \Gamma </m> -RRB- ?
let <m> H _ 0 , \ldots , H _ n </m> be <m> n </m> hyperplanes in <m> \mathbb { P } ^ n ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> with normal crossings and denote by <m> H </m> the union of them . i am trying to understand why -LRB- 1 -RRB- <m> H ^ n ( \mathbb { P } ^ n ( \mathbb { C } ) , H ) </m> is one dimensional -LRB- 2 -RRB- <m> H ^ n ( \mathbb { P } ^ n ( \mathbb { C } ) - H ) </m> is one dimensional let us begin by -LRB- 1 -RRB- . this is what i managed to do . applying the long exact sequence for relative cohomology one gets <m> . . . \to H ^ { n - 1 } ( \mathbb { P } ^ { n - 1 } , H ) \to H ^ { n - 1 } ( \mathbb { P } ^ { n - 1 } ) \to H ^ { n - 1 } ( H ) \to H ^ n ( \mathbb { P } ^ n , H ) \to H ^ n ( \mathbb { P } ^ n ) \to H ^ n ( H ) \to H ^ { n + 1 } ( \mathbb { P } ^ { n } , H ) \to \cdots </m> assume for example that <m> n </m> is even . then <m> H ^ { n - 1 } ( \mathbb { P } ^ n ) = H ^ { n + 1 } ( \mathbb { P } ^ n ) = 0 </m> and <m> H ^ n ( \mathbb { P } ^ n ) = \mathbb { Q } ( - n ) </m> , so one gets <m> 0 \to H ^ { n - 1 } ( H ) \to H ^ n ( \mathbb { P } ^ n , H ) \to \mathbb { Q } ( - n ) \to H ^ n ( H ) \to H ^ { n + 1 } ( \mathbb { P } ^ n , H ) \to 0 </m> now i should say something about <m> H ^ { n - 1 } ( H ) </m> and <m> H ^ n ( H ) </m> . i guess i should use the fact that , <m> H </m> being normal crossings , this cohomology can be computed using the complex <m> \oplus _ i H ^ \ast ( H _ i ) \to \oplus _ { i , j } H ^ \ast ( H _ i \cap H _ j ) \to \oplus _ { i , j , k } H ^ \ast ( H _ i \cap H _ j \cap H _ k ) \to \cdots </m> and also the fact that cohomology in degree <m> n </m> or <m> n - 1 </m> should be simple because i have <m> n + 1 </m> hyperplanes . but i do n't know how to continue . can anybody help me ?
is there anyone can tell me any information about the integer solution to the combinatotial equation <m> \sum ( - 1 ) ^ k \binom { n } { k } \alpha _ k = b _ n </m> -LRB- all variables are integers -RRB- ? for example , suppose alpha _ -LCB- 0 -RCB- = 0 , when n = 2 , it is 2alpha _ -LCB- 1 -RCB- - alpha _ -LCB- 1 -RCB- = - b _ -LCB- 2 -RCB- if we take b _ -LCB- 2 -RCB- to be a given number , this is a first degree diophantine equation , we know how to solve it using elementary number theory , right ? but when n = 3 , take b _ -LCB- 3 -RCB- to be a given number , alpha _ -LCB- 0 -RCB- = 0 , could you write down a general solution to this dioph . equation ? thank you very much !
i am certain that the following result holds , but was not able to find a reference . do you know one ? or maybe you can give a short proof ? statement . let <m> ( M ^ 4 , \omega ) </m> be a compact symlectic manifold and let <m> J _ t </m> be a smooth family of compatible almost complex structures , <m> t \in ( - 1 , 1 ) </m> . suppose that <m> S _ 0 </m> is a smooth <m> J _ 0 </m> - holomorphic sphere in <m> ( M ^ 4 , J _ 0 ) </m> with zero self-intersection . consider now <m> M ^ 4 \times ( - 1 , 1 ) </m> , introduce <m> J _ t </m> on each fibre <m> M ^ 4 \times t </m> , and take in it the surface <m> S ^ 2 _ 0 \times 0 </m> . then there is a neighbourhood <m> U </m> of <m> S ^ 2 _ 0 \times 0 </m> such that for any <m> ( x , t ) \in U </m> there is a unique <m> J _ t </m> - holomorphic sphere passing through <m> ( x , t ) </m> contained in <m> U </m> . in other words <m> J _ t </m> - holomorphic spheres produce on <m> U </m> a structure of a smooth <m> S ^ 2 </m> - fibration -LRB- over a <m> 3 </m> - ball -RRB- .
i am interested in a reference for -LRB- or counterexample to -RRB- a particular <m> C ^ 0 </m> estimate for solutions of the laplace equation with neumann boundary conditions . more precisely , let <m> ( M , g ) </m> be a <m> C ^ \infty </m> compact riemannian manifold with non-empty smooth boundary <m> \partial M </m> . let <m> \Delta _ g = - d i v _ g \nabla </m> denote the laplace operator and <m> \nu </m> the outward pointing unit normal on <m> \partial M </m> . consider -LRB- strong -RRB- solutions <m> u </m> to the following system \ begin -LCB- cases -RCB- \ delta _ gu = f & \ text -LCB- in -RCB- m \ \ \ partial _ \ nu u = h & \ text -LCB- on -RCB- \ partial m \ end -LCB- cases -RCB- where <m> f \in C ^ \infty ( M ) </m> and <m> h \in C ^ \infty ( \partial M ) </m> satisfy <m> \int _ M f d v o l _ g = \int _ { \partial M } h d \sigma _ g </m> -LRB- the smoothness condition is for simplicity but the later condition is necessary for the problem to be well-posed -RRB- . here <m> d v o l _ g </m> denotes the riemannian volume form and <m> d \sigma _ g </m> denotes its pullback under the inclusion <m> \partial M \to M </m> . to specify <m> u </m> uniquely , let us also suppose that it has zero average value i.e. <m> \int _ M u d v o l _ g = 0 </m> . my question is this : does there exist <m> C > 0 </m> , independent of <m> f </m> and <m> h </m> , such that <m> \sup _ M | u | \leq C ( \sup _ M | f | + \sup _ { \partial M } | h | ) </m> ? most classical sources -LRB- evans , gilbarg + trudinger , and aubin -RRB- either only consider dirichlet conditions -LRB- in which case the analogous estimate is essentially just the maximum principle -RRB- or only provide schauder estimates for the neumann problem -- this is not quite what i want . does anyone know of a resource for this kind of estimate or of a counterexample ?

i was reading a paper where i came across the following argument : for any <m> x </m> in <m> M </m> and for a geodesic ball <m> B ( x ; \varepsilon ) </m> in a compact riemannian manifold <m> M </m> with injectivity radius bigger than or equal to epsilon , and for any smooth eigenfunction <m> f </m> of laplacian on <m> M </m> , we have : the square of <m> f ( x ) </m> is <m> \leq C </m> times -LRB- the square of <m> L ^ 2 </m> norm of <m> f </m> over <m> B ( x ; \varepsilon ) </m> <m> + </m> square of <m> L ^ 2 </m> norm of <m> L ( f ) </m> over <m> B ( x : \varepsilon ) </m> -RRB- , where <m> L ( f ) = </m> laplacian of <m> f </m> , where <m> C </m> is independent of the riemannian metric on <m> M </m> . i was unable to see , with my limited analysis knowledge , why this is true , but they mentioned that it follows from sobolev 's and garding 's inequality , for which they referred to s. agmon 's `` lectures on elliptic boundary value problems '' ... still it is unclear to me . n.b. : the injectivity radius of a manifold is the smallest of all numbers r such that i can have a geodesic ball of radius r around each point of m. e.g. injectivity radius of the sphere of radius <m> 1 </m> with standard metric is <m> \pi </m> , injectivity radius of <m> \Bbb R ^ n </m> is infinity etc. any help ? thanks in advance .

i 'm studying the ramsey numbers , especially <m> R ( 3 , 6 ) = 1 8 </m> i understand that the proof using the theorem <m> R ( m , n ) < R ( m - 1 , n ) + R ( m , n - 1 ) </m> can only prove that <m> R ( 3 , 6 ) < 2 0 </m> . however by cariolaro 's `` on the ramsey number <m> R ( 3 , 6 ) = 1 8 </m> '' i understand the proof for <m> R ( 3 , 6 ) < 1 9 </m> . now i try to understand the proof for <m> R ( 3 , 6 ) > 1 7 </m> , but the graph there is built with some program . i read that it is possible to build a graph to test <m> R ( 3 , 6 ) > 1 7 </m> without programs . in `` thesis -LRB- ph. d. -RRB- -- university of waterloo , 1966 , chromatic graphs and ramsey 's theorem '' by j. g. kalbfleisch this result supposedly exists , but unfortunately i can not find the document . can someone give the idea of the construction or do you know of any document or article where you do it ?
let <m> H </m> be the subgroup of <m> \text { G L } ( n + k , \mathbb { R } ) </m> consisting of matrices whose lower <m> n \times k </m> block is empty ; i.e. consisting of matrices of the form <m> \begin {pmatrix} A & * \\ 0 & B \end {pmatrix} , </m> where <m> A \in \text { G L } ( n , \mathbb { R } </m> -RRB- , <m> B \in \text { G L } ( k , \mathbb { R } ) </m> , and <m> * </m> is arbitrary . i know that <m> \text { G L } ( n + k , \mathbb { R } ) </m> is a principal <m> H </m> bundle over the grassmann manifold <m> G _ n ( \mathbb { R } ^ { n + k } ) </m> . let <m> E </m> denote the total space of this principal bundle . let <m> \rho : H \to \text { G L } ( n , \mathbb { R } ) </m> be the surjective homomorphism obtained by letting <m> H </m> act on the first <m> n </m> coordinates of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { n + k } </m> , and let <m> E \times _ H \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> be the total space of the <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> bundle over <m> G _ n ( \mathbb { R } ^ { n + k } ) </m> obtained from this action . how do i see that <m> E \times _ H \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> is isomorphic to the total space of the tautological bundle <m> \gamma ^ n </m> over <m> G _ n ( \mathbb { R } ^ { n + k } ) </m> ?

the number <m> k + h ^ { } </m> appears at many places in the representation theory of affine lie algebras -LRB- and probably elsewhere -RRB- . here <m> h ^ { } </m> is the dual coxeter number of the root system , and <m> k </m> is the level of the representation . a few examples which i know : the verlinde formula for the dimension of conformal blocks , modular transformation of characters , the sugawara vector , chern-simons theory , this question , and numerous places in kac 's book . i have found some explanation for the dual coxeter number , but nothing serious for this . the arguments i have seen so far usually sum over the roots/weights/generators / etc. , and then multiply/divide with this number , but it is not clear for me why . it would be nice to see what is the geometric meaning of this , if there is any . can anyone tell some motivation why does this number appear so frequently ? sorry for the `` metaquestion '' .
i am looking for a version of ehresmann 's theorem for analytic manifolds over the <m> p </m> - adic numbers <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> or , more generally , local fields . i follow the conventions from serre 's book `` lie algebras and lie groups '' concerning analytic manifolds over local fields . recall that ehresmann 's theorem states that a proper submersion between smooth manifolds is a locally trivial fibration .
given the diophantine equation <m> x ^ 2 ( 8 x - 3 ) = y ^ 2 z , </m> is there a way to efficiently count the number of solutions that satisfy <m> x + y + z \leq n </m> , where <m> n </m> is a fixed given integer ? also , for any fixed <m> x </m> , is it possible to count all such solutions <m> ( x , y , z ) </m> without having to explicitly find all the divisors of <m> x ^ 2 ( 8 x - 3 ) </m> ? a hint or a reference -LRB- if this is , in fact , easy -RRB- would be quite helpful . i asked this on mse , but got no responses .
given a map from <m> \big ( [ 0 , 1 ] , \mathcal { B } [ 0 , 1 ] , m \big ) </m> to a banach space <m> ( X , \| \cdot \| ) </m> . there are strong measurable functions -LRB- they are the point wise a.e. limit of simple functions -RRB- and weak measurable functions -LRB- for each <m> u ^ * \in X ^ * </m> , we have <m> t \mapsto \langle u ^ * , f ( t ) \rangle </m> is a measurable as a function from <m> [ 0 , 1 ] \rightarrow \mathbb { R } </m> -RRB- . i have two questions :
consider the first order nonlinear ode problem : <m> y ' ( x ) = \frac { 1 + a y ( x ) x } { 1 + b y ( x ) x } , \quad x > 0 </m> where <m> a , b > 0 </m> are some constants . i would like to know if these kind of equations were studied somewhere else -LRB- i.e. , existence of global solutions , uniqueness etc -RRB- . any references will be helpful . remarks : mathematica does not give me anything . i have tried to use maple and it shows me that <m> y </m> is a solution of an equation involving some whittaker functions but i am not sure about this . if <m> a = b </m> then <m> y = x + C </m> . if <m> a = 1 , b = 2 </m> then one can take <m> y ( x ) = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \left ( x - \frac { 1 } { x } \right ) </m>
i am interested in polynomials with few terms -LRB- `` short polynomials '' , `` fewnomials '' -RRB- in ideals . a simple to state question is given an ideal <m> I \subset k [ x _ 1 , \dots , x _ n ] </m> , what is the shortest polynomial in <m> I </m> ? there are answers for `` does an ideal contain a monomial/binomial ? '' , but the general question seems to be hard . let 's try an easy specific question : how few terms can a polynomial in <m> \langle ( x - 1 ) ( y - 1 ) ( x ^ 2 y - 1 ) \rangle \subset k [ x , y ] </m> have ? the generator has 8 terms so this is an upper bound for the minimum . a lower bound for the minimum is 6 which can be seen as follows : let <m> f </m> be the generator . the newton polytope of <m> f </m> is a hexagon with two interior points . any polynomial in <m> I </m> is of the form <m> f g </m> for some <m> g \in k [ x , y ] </m> and its newton polytope is <m> \text { N e w t o n } ( f ) + \text { N e w t o n } ( g ) </m> . since the number of vertices can not decrease under the minkowski sum , <m> f g </m> has at least six terms . are there polynomials with six or seven terms in <m> I </m> ?
i came across the problem `` find all integer solutions to <m> y ^ 2 = x ^ 3 + 1 7 </m> .

let <m> P </m> be a probability measure on a space <m> \mathcal X </m> and <m> h : \mathcal X \rightarrow \mathbb R </m> is measurable function with finite moments of order 1 and 2 . i 'm interested in approximating the log mgf <m> t \mapsto \log \mathbb E _ P [ \exp ( t h ( x ) ] </m> . now , using a simple taylor expansion , one can carelessly write <m> \log \mathbb E _ P [ \exp ( t h ( x ) ] = t \mathbb E _ P [ h ( x ) ] + \frac { t ^ 2 } { 2 } \operatorname { V a r } _ P [ h ( x ) ] + o ( t ^ 2 ) . </m> question
as well-known , <m> n \prod _ { p \vert n } ( 1 - 1 / p ) </m> -LRB- where the product is over all prime divisors of a natural integer <m> n </m> -RRB- is the number of classes modulo <m> n </m> which are invertible modulo <m> n </m> . similarly , <m> n \prod _ { p \vert n } ( 1 - 2 / p ) </m> counts the number -LRB- up to equivalence modulo affine transformations of <m> \mathbb Z ^ 2 </m> -RRB- of triangles of area <m> n / 2 </m> with integral vertices <m> A , B , C </m> -LRB- labelled in order to destroy automorphisms and inducing the orientation of the plane -RRB- and no other integral points on the boundary . -LRB- proof : up to affine transformations , one can assume <m> A = ( 0 , 0 ) , B = ( 0 , 1 ) </m> and <m> C = ( n , i ) </m> with <m> i \in \{ 0 , n - 1 \} </m> such that <m> n </m> is coprime with <m> i </m> and <m> i - 1 </m> . if <m> n </m> is a prime power <m> p ^ a </m> this leaves <m> p ^ a - 2 p ^ { a - 1 } </m> possibilities and the general case follows from the chinese remainder theorem . -RRB- is there an interesting interpretation for <m> n \prod _ { p \vert n } ( 1 - 3 / p ) </m> ? -LRB- one has perhaps to restrict the formula to odd natural integers . -RRB- by interesting i mean an interpretation different from the obvious one : for <m> n \geq 3 </m> odd , <m> n \prod _ { p \vert n } ( 1 - 3 / p ) </m> counts the number of classes <m> i </m> modulo <m> n </m> such that <m> i , i + 1 </m> and <m> i + 2 </m> are all coprime with <m> n </m> .

baker 's theorem basically says that , given algebraic numbers <m> a _ 1 , \ldots , a _ n </m> and <m> m _ 1 , \ldots , m _ n </m> , if there is no good reason for a linear combination <m> \sum m _ i \log a _ i </m> to cancel , then it is nonzero and has a lower bound , roughly <m> O ( H ) </m> , where <m> H </m> is the height of <m> m _ i </m> . i wonder if there is a version like the following : given algebraic numbers <m> a _ 1 , \ldots , a _ n , b _ 1 , \ldots , b _ n </m> and integers <m> m _ 1 , \ldots , m _ n </m> , what can we say about a linear combination <m> \sum m _ i \log a _ i \log b _ i </m> -LRB- preferably , a quantitative version of the lower bound -RRB- .
the precise statement on j. w. morgan 's `` the seiberg-witten equations and applications to the topology of smooth four-manifolds -LRB- mn-44 -RRB- '' that 4-manifold <m> X </m> admits a spinc structure -LRB- lemma 3.1.2 -RRB- seems to be that every 4-orientable manifold x admits a <m> S p i n ^ c </m> structure . this means that we impose the <m> w _ 1 ( X ) = 0 </m> for the 4-orientable manifold x. however , for 4-unorientable manifold <m> M </m> , we may modify the statement to different structures . in addition to , <m> S p i n ^ c = \frac { ( S p i n \times U ( 1 ) ) } { \mathbb { Z } / 2 \mathbb { Z } } , </m> we can have : <m> P i n ^ c = \frac { ( P i n ^ + \times U ( 1 ) ) } { \mathbb { Z } / 2 \mathbb { Z } } = \frac { ( P i n ^ - \times U ( 1 ) ) } { \mathbb { Z } / 2 \mathbb { Z } } , </m> <m> P i n ^ { \tilde c + } = \frac { ( P i n ^ + \ltimes U ( 1 ) ) } { \mathbb { Z } / 2 \mathbb { Z } } , </m> <m> P i n ^ { \tilde c - } = \frac { ( P i n ^ - \ltimes U ( 1 ) ) } { \mathbb { Z } / 2 \mathbb { Z } } . </m> see for example this ref , annals of physics 394 , 244-293 -LRB- 2018 -RRB- and references therein . it seems that i can improve john morgan 's statement to show that

i was reading james cogdell 's notes here on automorphic representations and came to the following claim about the spherical hecke algebra <m> \mathcal H ( \operatorname { G L } _ 2 ( \mathbb Q _ p ) , \operatorname { G L } _ 2 ( \mathbb Z _ p ) ) </m> . he remarks that this hecke algebra identifies with the algebra spanned by the classical hecke operators <m> T _ { p ^ r } </m> .
this question is inspired by this one , however i believe is quite different . the mellin transform for : <m> \displaystyle \Gamma ( s ) \, \zeta ( s ) = \int _ 0 ^ \infty x ^ { s - 1 } \frac { 1 } { e ^ x - 1 } \, d x </m> equals : <m> \frac { 1 } { 2 \, \pi \, i } \int _ { c - \infty \, i } ^ { c - \infty \, i } s ^ { - x } \, \zeta ( x ) \, \Gamma ( x ) \, d x = \frac { 1 } { e ^ s - 1 } </m> and is only valid for <m> c > 1 </m> -LRB- the relation breaks down for <m> c \le 1 </m> , although the lhs still converges -RRB- . however , when i replace <m> \zeta ( s ) </m> by its series <m> \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \frac { 1 } { n ^ s } </m> or its associated euler-product <m> \prod _ { p r i m e s } \frac { 1 } { 1 - p ^ { - s } } </m> then numerical evidence suggests that the relation remains valid for <m> 0 < c \le 1 </m> . i tested for increasing <m> v </m> : <m> \frac { 1 } { 2 \, \pi \, i } \int _ { c - v \, i } ^ { c - v \, i } s ^ { - x } \, \prod _ { n = 1 } ^ v \frac { 1 } { 1 - p _ n ^ { - s } } \, \Gamma ( x ) \, d x = \frac { 1 } { e ^ s - 1 } </m> and found using pari/gp -LRB- with high real precision -RRB- embedded in sagemath for e.g. <m> s = \frac 1 2 , c = \frac 1 2 </m> :
is it true that , in the category of <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - modules , <m> \operatorname { H o m } _ { \mathbb { Z } } ( \mathbb { Z } [ x ] , \mathbb { Z } ) \cong \mathbb { Z } [ [ x ] ] </m> and <m> \operatorname { H o m } _ { \mathbb { Z } } ( \mathbb { Z } [ [ x ] ] , \mathbb { Z } ) \cong \mathbb { Z } [ x ] </m> ?
consider the following chain <m> \{ A _ 1 , A _ 2 , A _ 3 , \cdots , A _ { n } \} </m> of orbit spaces of even-rank anti-symmetric tensors , where <m> A _ k : = \frac { \Lambda ^ { 2 k } ( \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 n } ) } { e _ { i _ 1 } \wedge \cdots \wedge e _ { i _ { 2 k } } \mapsto R e _ { i _ 1 } \wedge \cdots \wedge R e _ { i _ { 2 k } } } , ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ R \in O ( 2 n ) , </m> the base case is well-known , and corresponds to the canonical form for a real , antisymmetric matrix : <m> A _ 1 = \frac { \Lambda ^ 2 ( \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 n } ) } { e _ i \wedge e _ j \mapsto R e _ i \wedge R e _ j } = \left \{ \bigg [ \sum _ { j } \lambda _ { j } e _ { 2 j - 1 } \wedge e _ { 2 j } \bigg ] , ~ ~ \lambda _ j \in \mathbb { R } \right \} \simeq \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> are there any results for <m> A _ 2 </m> ?
suppose we have , for fixed <m> P ( t ) \in \mathbb { Z } [ t ] </m> , infinite couples of integer solutions <m> ( t _ i , x _ i ) \in \mathbb { Z } </m> to the equation <m> P ( t ) - T _ n ( x ) = 0 </m> where <m> T _ n </m> is the <m> n </m> - th chebycheff polynomial of the first kind with <m> n </m> a fixed odd integer . is it possible to conclude that there is a polynomial solution <m> A ( t ) </m> such that <m> P ( t ) - T _ n ( A ( t ) ) </m> is the zero polynomial or that there is a polynomial <m> B ( x ) </m> such that <m> P ( B ( x ) ) - T _ n ( x ) = 0 </m> ? edit : the answer to this question is no -LRB- see joro answer : https://mathoverflow.net/q/280037 -RRB- . please focus only on the following one : at least , is it possible to conclude that for each <m> t \in \mathbb { Z } </m> except a finite set there is a solution <m> x \in \mathbb { Z } </m> such that said equation holds ?

let <m> X </m> be a variety over a field <m> k </m> . we have the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves <m> D ^ b _ { c o h } ( X ) </m> and the derived category of perfect complex <m> P e r f ( X ) </m> . it is clear that <m> P e r f ( X ) </m> is a strictly full triangulated subcategory of <m> D ^ b _ { c o h } ( X ) </m> . then following orlov 2003 we define the triangulated category of singularities of <m> X </m> as the quotient of <m> D ^ b _ { c o h } ( X ) </m> and <m> P e r f ( X ) </m> , i.e. <m> D _ { s g } ( X ) = D ^ b _ { c o h } ( X ) / P e r f ( X ) . </m> recall that we call <m> \mathcal { A } \to \mathcal { B } \to \mathcal { C } </m> an exact sequence of triangulated categories if the composition sends <m> \mathcal { A } </m> to zero , <m> \mathcal { A } \to \mathcal { B } </m> is fully faithful and coincides -LRB- up to equivalence -RRB- with the subcategory of those objects in <m> \mathcal { B } </m> which are zero in <m> \mathcal { C } </m> , and the induced functor <m> \mathcal { B } / \mathcal { A } \to \mathcal { C } </m> is an equivalence . it is easy to verify that <m> P e r f ( X ) \to D ^ b _ { c o h } ( X ) \to D _ { s g } ( X ) </m> is an exact sequence of triangulated categories . on the other hand we have the grothendieck groups of the above triangulated categories . in more details we define <m> K ^ 0 ( X ) </m> the grothendieck groups of <m> P e r f ( X ) </m> , <m> K _ 0 ( X ) </m> the grothendieck groups of <m> D ^ b _ { c o h } ( X ) </m> , and <m> K _ 0 ( D _ { s g } ( X ) ) </m> the grothendieck groups of <m> D _ { s g } ( X ) </m> . then from the exact sequence <m> P e r f ( X ) \to D ^ b _ { c o h } ( X ) \to D _ { s g } ( X ) </m> we get an exact sequence of abelian groups <m> K ^ 0 ( X ) \to K _ 0 ( X ) \to K _ 0 ( D _ { s g } ( X ) ) \to 0 . </m> see schlichting 2008 exercise 3.1.6 . we would like to extend the above exact sequence to the left , via higher algebraic k-theory . however , there is not higher k-theory on merely triangulated categories . nevertheless we have <m> K ^ i ( X ) </m> and <m> K _ i ( X ) </m> for <m> i \geq 1 </m> in the framework of complicial exact categories . <m> \textbf { M y q u e s t i o n } </m> is : could we define the higher k-theory of <m> D _ { s g } ( X ) </m> and get a long exact sequence <m> \ldots \to K ^ i ( X ) \to K _ i ( X ) \to K _ i ( D _ { s g } ( X ) ) \to K ^ { i - 1 } ( X ) \to \ldots ? </m>
let <m> G , H </m> be finite groups . suppose we have a epimorphism <m> G \times G \rightarrow H \times H </m> . can we find an epimorphism <m> G \rightarrow H </m> ? a fellow graduate student asked me this question during ta sessions . baffled , i asked this question on mathstackexchange -LSB- site -RSB- -LSB- 1 -RSB- , received some positive votes but no answer . according to him he has been running a software check on small order groups for days , and still have not find any counter example . so i venture to ask in here . it ` feels ' unlikely to be true , yet we can not find a proof or a counter example . this is a repost of https://mathoverflow.net/questions/110857/can-we-ascertain-that-there-exist-an-epimorphism-g-rightarrow-h by the request of the moderator from meta.mathoverflow . the original post will be merged with this post .

there is a famous passage on the third page of deligne 's second paper on the weil conjectures where he expresses his dislike of the axiom of choice , as manifested in the isomorphism between <m> C </m> and <m> \bar { Q _ p } </m> . the proof of said isomorphism runs as follows . both <m> C </m> and <m> \overline { Q _ p } </m> have transcendence bases , <m> S </m> and <m> T </m> . then <m> C \simeq \overline { Q ( S ) } </m> and <m> \overline { Q _ p } \simeq \overline { Q ( T ) } </m> . but <m> C </m> and <m> \overline { Q _ p } </m> have the same cardinality , and hence , so do <m> S </m> and <m> T </m> . therefore , <m> Q ( S ) \simeq Q ( T ) </m> and , from there , <m> C \simeq \overline { Q _ p } </m> . for myself , this proof is quite convincing . recently , torsten ekedahl expressed his opinion to the contrary , and this led to the following exchange : why worry about the axiom of choice ? so i wondered about other expert opinions on this matter . do you find the isomorphism unbelievable and , if so , why ?

may i ask what is the -LRB- historical -RRB- reason we adopted the <m> \sigma </m> - algebra rhetoric instead of <m> \sigma </m> - rings -LRB- like used in halmos -RRB- ? to my knowledge almost all modern measure theory or real analysis textbooks use <m> \sigma </m> - algebra nowadays , but it seems the old theory is perfectly legitimate to teach students basics of lebesgue theory . in particular when i was learning the material , halmos ' book was very readable . hence is my question . motivation : may need to explain measure theory to undergraduates next semester as i work as a probability ta , though the class itself does not involve measure theory . my advisor told me he believe the old theory still has much of its vitality , and everything works well . so he saw no need to introduce the new theory to -LRB- first-time -RRB- learners . in fact , he is going to publish a new book in gtm series using the old theory . while this is certainly true , i do not understand what pushed the historical conceptual change . what is the real benefit -LRB- further unification of conceptual framework , cleaned up better proofs , generalized easily for non-archemedian fields , etc -RRB- ? -LRB- for an example of my past unsuccessful effort to explain measure to undergraduates , see here -RRB-

i am interested in this paper which i ca n't read because it 's in german : frobenius , g. , Über die charaktere der mehrfach transitiven gruppen. , berl . ber . 1904 , 558-571 -LRB- 1904 -RRB- . zbl35 .0154.02 . a free online copy is here . i am specifically interested in the character table of <m> M _ { 1 2 } </m> which appears at the top of p. 568 . i would like to know what , exactly , frobenius proved with regard to this character table . if i understand correctly , at the time of publication , the existence of <m> M _ { 1 2 } </m> was still somewhat contentious . mathieu had written down some permutations that generated a 5-transitive group on 12 letters , but there was some uncertainty as to whether or not these permutations generated all of <m> A _ { 1 2 } </m> . i believe the uncertainty continued until the 1930 's , at which point witt used steiner systems , to show that <m> M _ { 1 2 } </m> was really a proper subgroup of <m> A _ { 1 2 } </m> . in light of this , my guess is that frobenius proved the following theorem :
i 'm currently trying to get familiar with the jordan normal form for matrices ; and after some example i ask for the possible jordan-form for the carleman matrix for the function <m> f ( x ) = \sin ( x ) </m> when thought as of infinite size . the form , as used in wolfram-alpha is always <m> A = M \cdot J \cdot M ^ { - 1 } </m> where <m> J </m> has the near-diagonal jordan form as an upper triangular matrix . well , it 's not difficult to extrapolate this from small to big , even to unobservable sizes and possibly to infinite size - for instance for the pascal-matrix , say with size <m> n \times n </m> with <m> n = 6 </m> <m> P _ 6 = \small \begin {bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ . & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ . & . & 1 & 3 & 6 & 1 0 \\ . & . & . & 1 & 4 & 1 0 \\ . & . & . & . & 1 & 5 \\ . & . & . & . & . & 1 \end {bmatrix} </m> we get -LRB- besides <m> M </m> and <m> M ^ { - 1 } </m> which are factorially rescaled versions of the matrices of stirling numbers of first and second kind -RRB- the shape of the jordan-matrix : <m> J _ 6 = \small \begin {bmatrix} 1 & 1 & . & . & . & . \\ . & 1 & 1 & . & . & . \\ . & . & 1 & 1 & . & . \\ . & . & . & 1 & 1 & . \\ . & . & . & . & 1 & 1 \\ . & . & . & . & . & 1 \end {bmatrix} </m> which extends consistently to larger sizes , and could so be conjectured to be valid also for the case where infinite size is assumed . -LRB- the pascalmatrix <m> P </m> is here the carleman-matrix for the function <m> g ( x ) = 1 + x </m> in the sense that with a `` vandermonde-vector '' of the form <m> V _ n ( x ) = [ 1 , x , x ^ 2 , x ^ 3 , . . . , x ^ { n - 1 } ] </m> we have for every size <m> n </m> <m> V _ n ( x ) \cdot P _ n = V _ n ( 1 + x ) </m> the same question using the truncated carleman-matrices <m> M _ n </m> for <m> f ( x ) = \sin ( x ) </m> which look like <m> M _ n = \Tiny { \begin {bmatrix} 1 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . \\ 0 & 1 & . & . & . & . & . & . \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & . & . & . & . & . \\ 0 & - 1 / 6 & 0 & 1 & . & . & . & . \\ 0 & 0 & - 1 / 3 & 0 & 1 & . & . & . \\ 0 & 1 / 1 2 0 & 0 & - 1 / 2 & 0 & 1 & . & . \\ 0 & 0 & 2 / 4 5 & 0 & - 2 / 3 & 0 & 1 & . \\ 0 & - 1 / 5 0 4 0 & 0 & 1 3 / 1 2 0 & 0 & - 5 / 6 & 0 & 1 \end {bmatrix} } </m> such that for <m> \lim _ { n \to \infty } </m> we have <m> \lim _ { n \to \infty } V _ n ( x ) \cdot M _ n = V _ n ( \sin ( x ) ) </m> is difficult : it gives for every <m> n </m> a jordan normal form with three blocks , one of them always of size <m> 1 </m> and the two others of increasing sizes with increasing <m> n </m> , here the example owith <m> n = 1 2 </m> <m> J _ { n } = \Tiny { \begin {array} { r r r r r r | r r r r r | r } 1 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . \\ 1 & 1 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . \\ . & 1 & 1 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . \\ . & . & 1 & 1 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . \\ . & . & . & 1 & 1 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . \\ . & . & . & . & 1 & 1 & . & . & . & . & . & . \\ \hline \\ . & . & . & . & . & . & 1 & . & . & . & . & . \\ . & . & . & . & . & . & 1 & 1 & . & . & . & . \\ . & . & . & . & . & . & . & 1 & 1 & . & . & . \\ . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & 1 & 1 & . & . \\ . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & 1 & 1 & . \\ \hline \\ . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & 1 \end {array} } </m> and trivially it does not make sense to try to speak of two infinite-size jordan blocks and to try to do a formula with it . for my application i 'm still confident , that - so far - the matrix-logarithm provides a reliable concept for powers of that carleman-matrix even when thought as extended to the infinite size , but after the first successful contacts with the jordan-form for simpler matrices -LRB- as for instance the matrix of stirling numbers 1st and 2nd kind -RRB- this is kind of disappointing at the moment ... the view into the caracteristic polynomial seems to be of no help ; i get for every size <m> n </m> the formula <m> ( x - 1 ) ^ n </m> which is also the same for the pascal - and for the stirling-matrices . i 've two questions : q1 : how to explain the different jordan forms although the characteristic polynomials are the same ? -LRB- that is something with the arithmetic and geometric multiplicity of eigenvalues , but i 've not yet understood that concept and how to work with it in this cases -RRB- q2 : could a generalized jordan normal form for the infinite size be given for the <m> f ( x ) = \sin ( x ) </m> - carlemanmatrix , too ? and how should that look like ?

let <m> \alpha \ge 1 </m> be an even integer , and <m> k </m> an intger s.t , <m> 1 \le k \le \alpha </m> . set <m> \alpha ' = \alpha / 2 </m> , <m> A = \mathrm { C a r d } ( \{ n : 0 \le n \le k - 1 , k \mid \alpha ' ( 4 n + 1 ) \} ) , \quad B = \mathrm { C a r d } ( \{ n : 0 \le n \le k - 1 , k \mid \alpha ' ( 4 n + 3 ) \} ) </m> so my question is : can we find <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> explicitly in terms of <m> \alpha ' </m> and <m> k </m> ? i tried with some examples and i suspect that , if <m> 2 ^ g \mid \mid \alpha </m> -LRB- i.e. , <m> \alpha = 2 ^ g \beta </m> with <m> \gcd ( \beta , 2 ) = 1 </m> -RRB- then <m> A = B = \left \{ \begin {array} { c c } 0 & \mbox { i f } \; k \; \mbox { m u l t i p l e o f } \; 2 ^ g \\ \gcd ( \alpha ' , k ) & \mbox { o t h e r w i s e . } \\ \end {array} \right . </m> i am pretty sure that this is true , but i do n't know how to prove it formally .
i 'm working on a problem where i need to consider a bilinear form of the form <m> y ^ t M z </m> where <m> M </m> is an <m> n </m> - by - <m> n </m> real symmetric matrix and <m> y , z \in \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> are vectors . i also need to consider restricted forms of such a product , of the form <m> \sum _ { i , j = 1 } ^ n y _ i m _ { i j } z _ j \mathbf { I } _ { ( y _ i , z _ j ) \in E } , </m> where <m> E </m> is some subset of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> . we recover <m> y ^ t M z </m> by taking <m> E = \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> . i want a common notation for <m> y ^ t M z </m> and for these restricted sums , so i have been writing <m> y ^ t M z = \langle y , z \rangle _ M </m> , and writing <m> \langle y , z \rangle _ { M , E } </m> for the restricted sum above . i see nothing wrong with the notation i 'm using . however , if there 's a standard notation for such things that i am unaware of , i would like to know about it . is there ? if you know of another notation , can you give me a reference ?
assume that <m> f \in C ^ { \infty } </m> and that <m> M _ n </m> is a sequence such that <m> \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { M _ n } { ( n + 1 ) M _ { n + 1 } } = \infty </m> and for certain compact neighborhood of the origin <m> U </m> of <m> \mathbb { R } </m> , there is a constant <m> A </m> such that for every <m> x \in U </m> , and <m> n \in \mathbb { N } </m> , <m> | g ^ { ( n ) } ( x ) | \leq n !

B ^ n M _ n , </m> for certain constant <m> B </m> and any <m> x \in V </m> , and <m> n \in \mathbb { N } </m> ? note : for example , if <m> \forall n , \ M _ n = 1 </m> then the condition on <m> g </m> implies it is analytic . then it follows <m> f </m> is also analytic and therefore <m> f \in C _ M ( V ) </m> for some <m> V </m> and some <m> B </m> .

the theory of <m> q </m> - characters for quantum affine algebras are studied in the q-characters of representations of quantum affine algebras and deformations of w-algebras , combinatorics of q-characters of finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras , and spectra of tensor products of finite dimensional representations of yangians . i think that the following results are true . but i did n't find their proofs in the above references . do the results follow from the general theory of <m> q </m> - characters ? thank you very much . let <m> m _ 1 , \ldots , m _ k </m> be dominant monomials in <m> \chi _ q ( M _ 1 ) \chi _ q ( M _ 2 ) </m> , where <m> M _ 1 , M _ 2 </m> are two simple <m> U _ q ( \hat { g } ) </m> - modules and <m> \chi _ q ( M ) </m> is the <m> q </m> - character of <m> M </m> . then we have the following two results . suppose that <m> m _ i </m> is not contained in any <m> \chi _ q ( L ( m _ j ) ) </m> , <m> j \neq i </m> . then <m> L ( m _ i ) </m> is an irreducible subfactor of <m> M _ 1 \otimes M _ 2 </m> . here <m> L ( m _ i ) </m> is the simple <m> U _ q ( \hat { g } ) </m> - module with highest <m> l </m> - weight <m> m _ i </m> . suppose that <m> L ( m _ i ) </m> is a subfactor of <m> M _ 1 \otimes M _ 2 </m> . suppose that <m> m _ j </m> appears in <m> \chi _ q ( M _ 1 ) \chi _ q ( M _ 2 ) </m> with multiplicity <m> p </m> and <m> m _ j </m> appears in <m> \chi _ q ( L ( m _ i ) ) </m> with multiplicity <m> p </m> . then <m> m _ j </m> is not a subfactor of <m> M _ 1 \otimes M _ 2 </m> .
we know that we can put two different structures on <m> \mathbb R ^ 5 </m> in the topological category . first is <m> C ( S ^ { 4 } ) </m> and second is <m> C ( \Sigma X ^ 3 ) </m> , where <m> X ^ 3 </m> is a homology sphere and <m> C ( \cdot ) </m> stands for the open cone construction and <m> \Sigma ( \cdot ) </m> stands for the suspension construction . the question is : do other cone structures exist ? i.e. if <m> C ( Y ^ { n - 1 } ) </m> is homeomorphic to <m> \mathbb R ^ n </m> , is it true that <m> Y </m> is <m> ( n - 1 ) </m> - sphere or the suspension of a <m> ( n - 2 ) </m> - homology sphere ?
i work over field of complex numbers . let <m> G = S L ( n ) \times S L ( n ) </m> , and <m> ( A , B ) \in G </m> acts on <m> m </m> - tuples of matrices <m> M _ { n \times n } ( \mathbb { C } ) ^ { \oplus m } </m> as follows <m> ( A , B ) \cdot ( M _ 1 , \ldots , M _ m ) \mapsto ( A ^ { - 1 } M _ 1 B , \ldots , A ^ { - 1 } M _ m B ) </m> where can i find a description of the ring of invariants ? for me it is very important that i consider <m> S L </m> case -LRB- opposed to <m> G L </m> case where this is just representations of a kronecker quiver with <m> n </m> arrows and the answer is trivial . -RRB-
casson 's invariant is an invariant of a homology 3-sphere , obtained by `` counting '' representations of the fundamental group into <m> S U ( 2 ) </m> . i was wondering if there is an analogous invariant counting representations into <m> S L ( 2 , R ) </m> ? curtis has an invariant counting representations into <m> S L ( 2 , C ) </m> . these invariants are obtained by taking a heegaard splitting of the manifold , and considering the intersection of the representation varieties of the two handlebodies in the representation variety of the heegaard surface . casson has to perturb the resulting varieties to make them transverse , then counts the intersections . curtis counts only the finite points of intersection using algebraic geometry to resolve any singularities , and ignoring any higher dimensional components of the intersection . then they both have to show that this count is invariant under stabilization of heegaard splittings , and therefore an invariant of the manifold . i was wondering whether one could combine the two approaches to get an analogous invariant in the case of <m> S L ( 2 , R ) </m> representations ? one would throw away higher dimensional components of intersection of the <m> S L ( 2 , R ) </m> varieties of the two handlebodies , and perturb near the isolated intersections to get a count of intersection points . if this works , what about making an analogous floer theory , by counting holomorphic disks between finite intersection points ? i have ' t done a literature search , but i suspect this is an open question .
for some countable first-order theory <m> T </m> , if we have a linearly ordered set <m> I </m> and an elementary chain <m> \{ \mathfrak { A } _ i \} _ { i \in I } </m> we can form a structure <m> \mathfrak { A } _ { I } ^ \star = ( \bigcup _ { i \in I } \mathfrak { A } _ i , \leq ) </m> where <m> \leq </m> is a new binary predicate interpreted by <m> x \leq y \leftrightarrow ( \forall i \in I ) ( y \in \mathfrak { A } _ i \rightarrow x \in \mathfrak { A } _ i ) </m> . the theory of this structure implies that every <m> \leq </m> initial segment is an elementary sub-structure of the whole structure relative to the original language . a small modification of hodges ' proof of vaught 's two-cardinal theorem , from ` building models by games , ' gives us this statement :
a group <m> G </m> is of type <m> F P _ 2 </m> if it admits a partial projective resolution of <m> \mathbb { Z } G </m> - modules <m> P _ 2 \rightarrow P _ 1 \rightarrow P _ 0 \rightarrow \mathbb { Z } \rightarrow 0 </m> with each <m> P _ i </m> being finitely generated and projective . in the event <m> G </m> acts freely and cocompactly on a space <m> X </m> with trivial first homology , then <m> G </m> is of type <m> F P _ 2 </m> . the converse holds if <m> G </m> has cohomological dimension <m> 2 </m> , but does it hold in general ?
let <m> R </m> be a real closed field . recall that the ladder of <m> R </m> is the divisible , ordered abelian group obtained by quotienting <m> R </m> by a certain equivalence relation . note that <m> R </m> has trivial ladder iff <m> R </m> is a subfield of <m> \mathbb R </m> . if <m> R </m> has trivial ladder and <m> L </m> is a divisible ordered abelian group , let <m> R \langle \! \langle x ^ L \rangle \! \rangle </m> be the field of puiseux series . then <m> R \langle \! \langle x ^ L \rangle \! \rangle </m> has ladder <m> L </m> . conversely , from any real closed field , we may extract a maximal subfield of <m> \mathbb R </m> and a ladder . i 'm wondering whether that 's all there is to it , i.e. , whether every real closed field is of the form <m> R \langle \! \langle x ^ L \rangle \! \rangle </m> . let me state this more formally : questions : let <m> R </m> be a real closed field with ladder <m> L </m> , and let <m> R _ 0 \subseteq R </m> be a maximal subfield with trivial ladder .
consider the following set of polynomials : <m> S : = \{ x ^ { 2 m } : m \geq 0 \} </m> . is there a non-zero element <m> f \in L ^ 2 ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) </m> such that <m> \int _ 0 ^ 1 f x ^ { 2 m } = 0 </m> for each <m> m \geq 0 </m> ? note that the answer is negative if <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> is replaced by <m> [ - 1 , 1 ] </m> . more generally , given a set of polynomials , is there any standard procedure to check if its linear span is dense in <m> L ^ 2 ( X ) </m> ?
let <m> X </m> be the real line with the usual topology . then clearly <m> | C ( X ) | = c = | X | </m> and on the other hand <m> | X | = 2 ^ { \aleph _ 0 } </m> . now my question is as in the is there a tychonoff space <m> X </m> of cardinality not of the form <m> 2 ^ \alpha </m> such that <m> | C ( X ) | = | X | </m> -LRB- where <m> C ( X ) </m> is the set of all real valued continuous functions on <m> X </m> -RRB- . any reference or help would be appreciated .
this question ought to have a straightforward -LRB- perhaps even glaringly obvious -RRB- answer , but so far i 've already wasted a few hours trying to untangle this web of inconsistent identifications . i 'm sure someone more experienced in this area will be able to quickly point out exactly where things go wrong . let <m> G </m> be a lie group and let <m> \mathbf { B } G </m> denote the moduli stack obtained by fixing a model for the homotopy orbits of <m> G </m> acting on the point -LRB- for example , one can take the nerve of the resulting action groupoid -RRB- . this smooth stack classifies smooth <m> G </m> - bundles . more precisely , if we are given smooth manifold <m> M </m> , the mapping space <m> { \rm M a p } ( M , \mathbf { B } G ) </m> is equivalent to the infinity groupoid <m> { \rm B u n } ^ { \rm s m } _ G ( M ) </m> of smooth principal <m> G </m> - bundles on <m> M </m> , with smooth isomorphisms and higher isomorphisms between them -LRB- to prove this one can , for example , resolve <m> M </m> by its cech nerve and identify the resulting mapping space directly -RRB- . i was under the impression that the map <m> { \rm B u n } _ G ^ { \rm s m } ( M ) \to { \rm B u n } _ G ( M ) </m> , which forgets the smooth structure and returns the underlying -LRB- topological -RRB- principal <m> G </m> - bundle was a natural equivalence . if this is the case , then since the latter is equivalent to <m> { \rm M a p } ( M , B G ) </m> and the projection <m> M \times \mathbb { R } \to M </m> induces an equivalence <m> { \rm M a p } ( M , B G ) \to { \rm M a p } ( M \times \mathbb { R } , B G ) \; , </m> we should conclude that <m> \mathbf { B } G </m> is homotopy invariant . on the other hand , if <m> \mathbf { B } G </m> were homotopy invariant , then it should be equivalent to the locally constant stack of its global sections . the global sections functor defines a right infinity adjoint and should therefore commute with delooping . but the global sections of <m> G </m> just return the points of <m> G </m> , viewed as a discrete simplicial set . we would therefore be forced identify <m> \mathbf { B } G </m> with the locally constant stack of <m> B G ^ { \delta } </m> , where <m> \delta </m> indicates that we have taken <m> G </m> to have the discrete topology . this stack clearly classifies something very different . in particular , if <m> M </m> is a smooth manifold , then we can identify the space of maps to this stack with the space <m> { \rm M a p } ( M , B G ^ { \delta } ) </m> , where we have forgetten the smooth structure on <m> M </m> . question clearly , something is wrong here . can someone help point me in the right direction ?
i am looking for simple examples of finitely generated residually finite group <m> G </m> with a subgroup of finite index <m> H < G </m> isomorphic to <m> G </m> . there are virtually nilpotent groups with this property , lamplighter groups <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p \wr \mathbb { Z } </m> , baumslag-solitar groups . i am interested in `` essentially different '' examples . is there a just-infinite group <m> G </m> with a subgroup of finite index isomorphic to <m> G </m> and which is not virtually nilpotent ?
in this question i had asked about proof of the property of selective ultrafilter . as was answered , the proof is trivial if we know that ultrafilter is selective iff it is ramsey ultrafilter . the proof of latter fact can be found in book `` theory of ultrafilters '' by comfort and negrepontis . non-trivial part of this proof is the implication `` selective <m> \implies </m> quasi-normal '' . while it is easy to see that the proof of latter implication is correct , i was unable to understand intuitive idea of this proof . so , i tried to find more easy and intuitively clear proof . so , the question : proof that for any selective ultrafilter <m> \mathcal { F } </m> and for arbitrary family of big sets <m> \{ A _ i \} _ { i \in \omega } </m> there exists a big set <m> A </m> with the property : <m> \forall i , j \in A : i < j \implies j \in A _ i </m> i will give my proof in answers below .
i 'm considering the congruence in the title , i.e. , <m> a ^ p \equiv 1 \pmod { b ^ p } , </m> where <m> a \ge b \ge 1 </m> are positive integers and <m> p </m> is an odd prime . for <m> p = 3 </m> , a brute-force computer search found many solutions with <m> b > 3 </m> . for <m> p = 5 </m> , there appear to be only solutions with <m> 1 \le b \le 5 </m> . for <m> p = 7 </m> , my search has n't turned up any solutions yet with <m> b \ge 7 </m> . are there any complete or partial results in this direction ?
the motivation for this question comes from the volume conjecture of kashaev-murakami-murakami . the jones family of invariants of knots and <m> 3 </m> - manifolds can all be defined using <m> \mathrm { S U } ( 2 ) </m> and some corresponding character varieties , but somehow these invariants can `` see '' representations into <m> \mathrm { S L } ( 2 , \mathbb C ) </m> as well -LRB- in particular , the volumes of these representations -RRB- . thus it is natural to ask how the theory would/could extend to <m> \mathrm { S L } ( 2 , \mathbb C ) </m> . in the witten-reshetikhin-turaev tqft , we associate to a surface <m> \Sigma </m> a certain space <m> Z ( \Sigma ) </m> as follows . there is a natural line bundle <m> \mathcal L </m> over the character variety <m> X : = \operatorname { H o m } ( \pi _ 1 ( \Sigma ) , \mathrm { S U } ( 2 ) ) / \mathrm { S U } ( 2 ) . </m> there is a natural symplectic form on <m> X </m> , and choosing a complex structure on <m> \Sigma </m> equips <m> X </m> with a complex structure which together with the symplectic form makes <m> X </m> a kahler manifold . then <m> Z ( \Sigma ) </m> is the hilbert space of square integrable holomorphic sections of <m> \mathcal L </m> -LRB- note <m> \mathcal L </m> carries a natural inner product , and the curvature form of the induced connection coincides with the natural symplectic form on <m> X </m> -RRB- . everything works well here in part because <m> X </m> is compact -LRB- trivially , since <m> \mathrm { S U } ( 2 ) </m> is compact -RRB- . but what if i want to work with the <m> \mathrm { S L } ( 2 , \mathbb C ) </m> character variety instead ? let 's call this character variety <m> X _ { \mathbb C } </m> -LRB- note that everything i 've said above about the symplectic form , kähler structure , and line bundle all extend naturally to <m> X _ { \mathbb C } </m> -RRB- . do the sections forming <m> Z ( \Sigma ) </m> naturally extend to sections of <m> \mathcal L </m> over <m> X _ { \mathbb C } </m> ? in what sense are they still square-integrable ? in particular , <m> X _ { \mathbb C } </m> is now non-compact , so how do i pick a finite-dimensional subspace of the space of sections of <m> \mathcal L </m> ? a justification of the notation <m> X _ { \mathbb C } </m> is as follows . if we consider a point on the variety <m> x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 + z ^ 2 + w ^ 2 = 1 </m> as representing the matrix <m>  </m> , then the real points are exactly <m> \mathrm { S U } ( 2 ) </m> and the complex points are <m> \mathrm { S L } ( 2 , \mathbb C ) </m> . using these coordinates for the construction of character varieties shows that <m> X _ { \mathbb C } </m> is indeed the complexification of <m> X </m> .
let x be a <m> T _ { 0 } </m> space . the specialization order ≤ on x is that if x is contained in cl -LCB- y -RCB- , then we call `` x ≤ y '' . obviously -LRB- x , ≤ -RRB- is a partially ordered set . a sober space is a topological space such that every irreducible closed subset of x is the closure of exactly one point of x : that is , this closed subset has a unique generic point . it is not difficult to see that specialization order induced by a sober space is a directed complete partial order -LRB- dcpo -RRB- . a subset o of a dcpo p is called scott-open if it is an upper set and if it is inaccessible by directed joins , i.e. if all directed sets d with supremum in o have non-empty intersection with o. the scott-open subsets of a dcpo p form a topology on p , the scott topology . -LRB- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scott_continuity -RRB- let -LRB- x , <m> \tau </m> -RRB- be a sober space . the specialization order ≤ induced by a sober space makes -LRB- x , ≤ -RRB- a dcpo . generally , the scott topology on -LRB- x , ≤ -RRB- is finer than <m> \tau </m> . but when do these two topologies coincide with each other ? two examples -LRB- sober c space and sober locally finitely compact space -RRB- are given in a book `` non-hausdorff topology and domain theory '' . -LRB- http://www.cambridge.org/ca/academic/subjects/mathematics/geometry-and-topology/non-hausdorff-topology-and-domain-theory-selected-topics-point-set-topology -RRB- can you find more examples like this ? or can you characterize this kind of sober space by simple property ?
i have an optimization problem where i need to select <m> k </m> integers over the interval <m> [ 0 , N ] </m> s.t. i maximize the minimum difference between any pairwise sum of the <m> k </m> integers -LRB- where we also include the sum of one selected integer with itself -RRB- . for example , if <m> k = 3 </m> , <m> N = 3 </m> , and we select the set of integers <m> ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) </m> , we have a set of <m> \frac { 1 } { 2 } k ( k + 1 ) = 6 </m> pairwise sums : <m> 1 + 1 = 2 </m> <m> 1 + 2 = 3 </m> <m> 1 + 3 = 4 </m> <m> 2 + 2 = 4 </m> <m> 2 + 3 = 5 </m> <m> 3 + 3 = 6 </m> here , the minimum difference between any two pairwise sums is trivially : <m> ( 4 - 4 ) = 0 </m> . as a function of <m> N </m> , how does one select the optimal set of <m> k \leq N </m> integers ? what happens in the limit where <m> N \to \infty </m> ? i 'd also be interested to understand how the number of optimal subsets of <m> k </m> integers scales as <m> N </m> becomes large .
suppose i have distinct real numbers <m> a _ i \in [ - 1 , 1 ] </m> , <m> i \in [ k ] </m> . i want to choose real numbers <m> b _ j , j \in [ k ] </m> such that the matrix <m> ( \arccos ( a _ i b _ j ) ) _ { i , j \in [ k ] } </m> is nonsingular .
it is known that the infinite sum of the non-trivial zeros <m> \rho _ n = \beta + \gamma _ n i </m> of <m> \zeta ( z ) </m> , when taken in pairs that are either conjugated or reflexive -LRB- they give the same outcome -RRB- , converges : <m> Z _ 1 ( s ) : = \displaystyle \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { 1 } { \rho _ n ^ s } + \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { 1 } { \overline { \rho _ n ^ s } } </m> for <m> s \ge 1 , s \in \mathbb { R } </m> the sum can be described analytically for integer values e.g. <m> Z ( 1 ) = 1 + \frac { \gamma } { 2 } - \frac { \ln ( 4 \pi ) } { 2 } </m> . for <m> s < 1 </m> the sum diverges . however the individual sums <m> \dfrac { 1 } { \rho _ n ^ s } </m> and <m> \dfrac { 1 } { \overline { \rho _ n ^ s } } </m> do not converge . even though the real parts do , their imaginary parts diverge and are annihilated by adding both sums together . i believe there exists an alternative ` alternating ' way to split up the total sum into subtotals that each do converge : take <m> \mu _ n = \beta + ( - 1 ) ^ n \gamma _ n i </m> and : <m> Z _ 2 ( s ) : = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { 1 } { \mu _ n ^ s } + \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { 1 } { \overline { \mu _ n ^ s } } </m> and the individual sums seem to nicely converge for all <m> \beta \in \mathbb { R } </m> and <m> s \ge 1 </m> . obviously <m> Z _ 1 ( s ) = Z _ 2 ( s ) </m> , however i found that contrary to <m> Z _ 1 ( s ) </m> the domain <m> Z _ 2 ( s ) </m> can be expanded towards <m> 0 \lt s \lt 1 </m> by taking : <m> Z _ { 2 - } ( s ) : = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { 1 } { \mu _ n ^ s } - \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { 1 } { \overline { \mu _ n ^ s } } </m> the difference converges towards an imaginary value and the diverging real parts are annihilated . question : 1 -RRB- can it be proven that <m> \displaystyle \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { 1 } { \mu _ n ^ s } </m> converges for all <m> s \ge 1 </m> ? 2 -RRB- is there anything known about analytic -LRB- closed form -RRB- values of <m> \displaystyle \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { 1 } { \mu _ n ^ s } </m> ?
in kolar , michor , & slovak 's book natural operations in differential geometry , it is proved the exterior derivative is universal in the following sense . proposition 25.4 . for <m> k > 0 </m> all natural operators <m> \Lambda ^ k T ^ \ast \rightsquigarrow \Lambda ^ { k + 1 } T ^ \ast </m> are constant multiples of the exterior derivative . for relevant definition see e.g this question . however , being a natural operator turns out to be an equivariance condition , which does not seem as obviously desirable as commuting with diffeomorphisms . -LRB- maybe this is equivalent somehow ? i have n't had a chance to decode what jet-group equivariance really means . -RRB- on the other hand , a result of palais says the the exterior derivative is the only -LRB- apriori assumed -RRB- linear map which commutes with diffeomorphisms . so yeah , i guess i 'm just trying to understand the relationship between being a natural operator in the sense of the linked question , to pleasantly commuting with all diffeomorphisms .
for a drinfeld -- jimbo quantized enveloping algebra <m> U _ q ( \frak { g } ) </m> , it is standard knowledge that the categories of modules are very different in the <m> q </m> a root of unity , and <m> q </m> not a root of unity case . the later being semi-simple , the former not . i wonder how the <m> q = - 1 </m> case look like . is it in any sense `` less badly behaved '' than the complex root of unity case ? as a concrete question , for <m> q = - 1 </m> , how far is the category of modules from being semi-simple .
let <m> B </m> be a symmetric bilinear form over a euclidean space <m> E </m> . say that <m> | B ( v , v ) | \le c \| v \| ^ 2 </m> for every <m> v \in E </m> , for some <m> c \ge 0 </m> . then <m> 4 B ( v , w ) = B ( v + w ) + B ( v - w ) </m> yields <m> 2 | B ( v , w ) | \le c ( \| v \| ^ 2 + \| w \| ^ 2 ) </m> . replacing <m> v </m> by <m> t v </m> , <m> w </m> by <m> t ^ { - 1 } w </m> and minimizing over <m> t </m> , we get <m> | B ( v , w ) | \le c \| v \| \cdot \| w \| </m> . notice that we ca n't use cauchy-schwarz if <m> B </m> is indefinite . i am interested in symmetric <m> n </m> - linear forms <m> B </m> over <m> E </m> .
berkeley 's collection of past qualifying exam questions contains the following : `` what are possible extensions of degree <m> 3 </m> of <m> \mathbb { Q } _ 2 </m> ? '' i 'm trying to figure out what the general approach is to attack a question like this . in this particular case , we know that <m> \mathbb { Q } _ 2 ^ \times \simeq \mathbb { Z } \times \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ^ \times </m> , where <m> \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ^ \times </m> is a pro- <m> 2 </m> group . it follows that there is only one abelian extension of degree <m> 3 </m> which would be the unramified one . hence , all other such extensions are totally ramified . thus we are left with enumerating the totally ramified extensions . here , the only approaches i can come up with is using the idea that such extensions are given by roots of eisenstein polynomials . the standard proof that <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> has a finite number of extensions of a particular degree , then shows that such polynomials are in bijection with a compact space and then uses krasner 's lemma to find a finite cover of this such that all the polynomials in the subsets of the cover have the same splitting fields . however , i ca n't really get anywhere applying this , as it seems to give duplicates . i 'm wondering if there 's any easy `` right '' way to solve problems like this ?
let <m> d </m> be a positive integer . my question is : can we then find a positive integer <m> r </m> -LRB- dependent on <m> d </m> -RRB- with integers <m> \alpha _ 1 , \alpha _ 2 , . . . , \alpha _ r </m> and <m> \beta _ 1 , \beta _ 2 , . . . , \beta _ r </m> such that the polynomials <m> P ( X ) = ( X - \alpha _ 1 ) \cdots ( X - \alpha _ r ) </m> and <m> Q ( X ) = ( X - \beta _ 1 ) \cdots ( X - \beta _ r ) </m> satisfy <m> \frac { P ( X ) } { Q ( X ) } = 1 + O ( \frac { 1 } { X ^ d } ) </m> as <m> X </m> tends to <m> \infty </m> but also <m> P \not = Q </m> ? for example , if <m> d = 1 </m> we easily find <m> r = 1 </m> , <m> \alpha _ 1 = 1 </m> and <m> \beta _ 1 = 0 </m> is a solution . similarly , if <m> d = 2 </m> we have <m> r = 2 </m> and <m> \alpha _ { 1 / 2 } = \pm 1 </m> and <m> \beta _ 1 = \beta _ 2 = 0 </m> since then <m> \frac { P ( X ) } { Q ( X ) } = \frac { X ^ 2 - 1 } { X ^ 2 } = 1 - \frac { 1 } { X ^ 2 } . </m>
the arthur trace formula and its variations provide general results for reductive groups , however to the extent of my knowledge only few specific instances of the formula have been really worked out in details , i.e. with precise decomposition of the spectrum , as for <m> \mathrm { G L } ( n ) </m> . is there such a formula for <m> \mathrm { G S p ( 4 ) } </m> or instances of use of the general trace formula in that setting ? or should i rather come back to the classification of representations of <m> \mathrm { G S p ( 4 ) } </m> -LRB- perhaps as in roberts and schmidt -RRB- ? thanks for any idea !
consider the space of all homogeneous degree <m> d </m> polynomials in three variables <m> [ X , Y , Z ] </m> , i.e. <m> f [ X , Y , Z ] = f _ { d 0 0 } X ^ d + f _ { d 1 0 } X ^ { d - 1 } Y + \ldots . </m> this can be thought of as a section of the line bundle <m> \gamma _ { \mathbb { P } ^ 2 } ^ { * d } \rightarrow \mathbb { P } ^ 2 </m> upto scaling this is the projective space <m> \mathbb { P } ^ { \delta _ { d } } </m> , where <m> \delta _ { d } = \frac { d ( d + 3 ) } { 2 } . </m> note that `` passing through a point '' imposes a linear condition on the coefficients <m> f _ { i j k } </m> . fix any number <m> k \leq \delta _ { d } </m> . is there an abstract way to show that there exist <m> k </m> points <m> [ X _ 1 , Y _ 1 , Z _ 1 ] \ldots , [ X _ k , Y _ k , Z _ k ] </m> such that passing through those <m> k </m> points imposes linearly independent conditions on the coefficients ? more precisely , the conditions will not be linearly independent implies that a certain determinant involving the <m> [ X _ i , Y _ i , Z _ i ] </m> is zero . how do i know that this determinant is not <m> \textit { a l w a y s } </m> zero ? one can explicitly write out the matrix whose determinant should not be zero and try to produce some explicit choice of points for which the determinant is not zero . but is there a way to avoid doing that ? does the bertini theorem -LRB- or some modification of that -RRB- imply that there exists <m> k </m> points so that passing through <m> k </m> points imposes linearly independent conditions ? in any case what is the simplest way to prove this seemingly obvious statement ? everything is over the complex numbers .
i 'm reading up on quantum groups and their applications and i 've come across a question i just ca n't find an answer to . i know about the basic representation theory of <m> U _ q ( \mathfrak { s l } _ 2 ) </m> and i know that when <m> q </m> is a primitive root of unity -LRB- say , not equal to 1 or -1 -RRB- then there are two irreducible representations in each dimension strictly smaller than the degree of <m> q </m> and an infinite family of them in the dimension equal to this degree . now , i 've often heard people say that there is however some sort of finiteness to its category of representations because all the rep 's of dimension <m> d e g ( q ) </m> are `` of quantum dimension zero '' . the only notion of `` quantum dimension '' i know of is in pivotal tensor categories -LRB- which the aforementioned are -RRB- by taking the trace of identity morphisms -LRB- or the pivotal structure maps if you will -RRB- but i do n't see why this dimension should vanish for these objects . am i interpreting this right but just am too blind to see it ? edit : suppose <m> d = m i n ( n \in \mathbb { N } : q ^ n = 1 ) </m> then by <m> d e g ( q ) </m> i mean the number <m> d </m> if <m> d </m> is odd and <m> d / 2 </m> if <m> d </m> is even . an example of the context i 'm talking about would be the paper topological invariants from non-restricted quantum groups as i 'm trying to deal with these turaev-viro-type models which should be formulated over fusion categories -LRB- so in particular categories with finitely many simple objects -RRB- so that the sum over dimensions in their definition does not diverge . however , this is unfortunately all hear-say my advisors have thrown at me making it rather difficult for me to actually find reliable sources .
what are the known restrictions on the topology of complex manifolds corresponding to analytifications of smooth proper algebraic varieties over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> ? i think they have to have non-zero <m> b _ 2 </m> but other than that ? i am asking because there lots of results on topology of kaehler manifolds and smooth complex projective varieties . however , an abstract variety admits a kaehler metric iff it is projective so most of those results do not direct apply to abstract non-projective varieties . i wonder which theorems survive and which do n't .
the graph reconstruction conjecture claims that any simple graph with 3 or more vertices is reconstructible from its `` deck '' of vertex-deleted subgraphs . -LRB- a nice introduction to this problem is at this wikipedia page . -RRB- my general question : i would be interested in any recent progress on the conjecture . the sources in the wikipedia article seem to be quite old . -LRB- i also have a copy of a bondy and hemminger survey from 1977 . a more recent article by ramachandran -LRB- in pdf here -RRB- is from 2004 but like many works on this conjecture , quickly detours into other reconstruction questions , edge reconstruction , etc. -RRB- a more specific question : since one can reconstruct the degree sequence of a graph then any regular graph can be reconstructed . but graphs with exactly two degrees , <m> k </m> and <m> k - 1 </m> , seem to be quite hard to reconstruct . i would be especially interested in results related to graphs with exactly two degrees , <m> k </m> and <m> k - 1 . </m> even more narrowly , can we reconstruct graphs in which all vertices have degree 2 or 3 ? -LRB- apparently kocay worked on that in the early 1980s , says ramachandran . -RRB- surely `` small '' graphs of degrees -LCB- 2,3 -RCB- are accessible to modern computers so there may now be a place for fertile exploration on this problem ?
basic question : is it correct that the <m> p </m> - adic langlands correspondence is known for <m> G L _ 2 </m> only over <m> Q _ p </m> but not other <m> p </m> - adic fields ? if so , i would like to request some light to be shed on this restriction , i.e. , why only <m> Q _ p </m> but not its extensions . any reference for this -LRB- and prospects -RRB- would be much appreciated . thanks !
given the complex grassmannian variety g <m> ( n , k ) </m> , i consider the tautological bundle <m> S </m> , i.e. the <m> n </m> - plane bundle whose fiber at each point of g <m> ( n , k ) </m> is given by the corresponding <m> n </m> - plane in <m> \mathbf { C } ^ k </m> . i consider now the chern polynomial of <m> S </m> , <m> c ( S ) </m> . how can i explicitly compute the chern roots of <m> c ( S ) </m> -LRB- i.e. cohomology classes <m> f _ i \in H ^ 2 ( G ( n , k ) , \mathbf { Z } ) , i = 1 , \dots , n </m> such that <m> c ( S ) = \Pi _ { i = 1 } ^ n ( 1 + f _ i t ) </m> -RRB- ?
k-trees a <m> k </m> - tree is a graph defined as follows : -LRB- they were defined by harary and palmer . -RRB- a -RRB- a complete graph with <m> k </m> vertices is a <m> k </m> - tree . b -RRB- a <m> k </m> - tree on <m> n </m> vertices <m> T </m> is obtained by a <m> k </m> - tree on <m> n - 1 </m> vertices <m> S </m> by adding a new vertex and connecting it to all the <m> k </m> vertices of a complete subgraph of <m> S </m> with <m> k </m> vertices . we can also regard a <m> k </m> - tree instead of a graph , as a <m> k </m> - dimensional simplicial complex , or as a <m> k + 1 </m> - uniform hypergraph . -LRB- we can also regard it as a <m> r </m> - uniform hypergraph for <m> 2 \le r \le k + 1 </m> . -RRB- the questions the decision problem
suppose <m> f </m> is a holomorphic function in a neighborhood of zero fixing zero . suppose <m> f ' ( 0 ) = \lambda </m> and <m> 0 < \lambda < 1 </m> . it 's not so hard to prove that <m>  </m> k <m>  </m> as <m> k \to \infty </m> , where <m> \Psi ( z ) </m> is the schröder function of <m> f </m> satisfying <m> \Psi ( f ( z ) ) = \lambda \Psi ( z ) </m> and <m> \Psi ' ( 0 ) = 1 </m> . -LRB- see for instance john milnor 's `` dynamics in one complex variable '' -RRB- recently i 've encountered a kind of binomial expansion . let <m> I _ n ( z ) = \sum _ { k = 0 } ^ n \binom { n } { k } ( - 1 ) ^ k f ^ { \circ k } ( z ) </m> it seems intuitive that since <m> f ^ { \circ k } </m> looks like <m> \lambda ^ k </m> , <m> I _ n </m> should look like <m> ( 1 - \lambda ) ^ n </m> . additionally <m> I ' _ n ( 0 ) = ( 1 - \lambda ) ^ n </m> , so the heuristic plays fairly well . sadly i 'm having trouble proving this . with that being said , my question can be asked :
is there an atlas <m> \mathcal { A } </m> for <m> \mathbb { C } P ^ 2 \setminus \{ p t \} </m> such that all transition maps of this atlas are affine maps ?
there is a result saying that if <m> P </m> is an abelian <m> p </m> - group of rank <m> 2 </m> then <m> | A u t ( P ) | = ( p - 1 ) ^ k p ^ j ( p + 1 ) ^ r , </m> for some <m> k , j , r </m> which depend on the order of <m> P </m> . moreover , if <m> P = C _ { p ^ t } \times C _ { p ^ s } </m> for <m> t \neq s </m> then <m> r = 0 </m> in the above equation . however , i did n't find any reference to these facts .
let <m> G </m> be a discrete group and let <m> S </m> be a generating set for <m> G </m> ; assume that <m> S </m> is symmetric -LRB- i.e. , <m> g \in S </m> iff <m> g ^ { - 1 } \in S </m> -RRB- . let <m> L = L _ S = \frac { 1 } { | S | } ( \sum _ { g \in S } g - 1 ) </m> be an element of the group algebra . for <m> F \in \ell ^ p ( G ) </m> and <m> g , h \in G </m> let <m> \lambda _ p ( g ) F </m> be defined by <m> \lambda _ p ( g ) F ( h ) = F ( h g ^ { - 1 } ) </m> ; this is the regular representation of <m> G </m> on <m> \ell ^ p ( G ) </m> . finally let <m> L _ p = \pi _ p ( L ) </m> . it is a classical result of kesten that <m> G </m> is non-amenable iff <m> L _ 2 </m> has a bounded inverse -LRB- i.e. , <m> 0 </m> is not in the spectrum of <m> L _ 2 </m> -RRB- . what is known in the case of <m> p = 1 </m> ? clearly if <m> G </m> is amenable , then there are functions <m> f _ n \in \ell ^ 1 ( G ) </m> with the property that <m> \Vert L _ 1 f _ n \Vert _ 1 / \Vert f _ n \Vert _ 1 \to 0 </m> showing that <m> 0 </m> is in the spectrum of <m> L _ 1 </m> and so <m> L _ 1 </m> is not invertible . also , if <m> G </m> is not amenable , then such <m> f _ n </m> can not exist under the additional assumption that <m> f _ n \geq 0 </m> . given <m> G </m> non-amenable , can one find a generating set <m> S </m> with the property that <m> L _ 1 </m> is invertible ?
i have a question concerning generalized order spaces . is there a generalized order space <m> X </m> with countable tightness which is not first countable ? thanks a lot !
are there any good description of the isometry group <m> O ( U \oplus E _ 8 ) </m> ? here <m> U </m> denotes the hyperbolic lattice and <m> E _ 8 </m> the root lattice of type <m> E _ 8 </m> .

let consider the ring <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> and <m> \zeta </m> be a <m> p </m> - th root of unity . especially <m> \zeta \not \in \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> . denote with <m> \Phi _ p ( x ) </m> the cyclotomical polynomial in <m> p </m> . since <m> p </m> is a prime we know that it has the shape <m> \Phi _ p ( x ) = 1 + x + x ^ 2 + . . . + x ^ { p - 1 } </m> . this gives rise for the quotient ring <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p [ X ] / \langle \Phi _ p ( x ) \rangle \cong \mathbb { Z } _ p [ \zeta ] = \mathbb { Z } _ p \oplus \zeta \mathbb { Z } _ p \oplus \dots \oplus \zeta ^ { p - 2 } \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> which is obviously a free <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> - module of rank <m> p - 1 </m> . denote <m> g = \zeta - 1 </m> . my question is how to see that <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p [ \zeta ] </m> isa local ring with maximal ideal <m> g \mathbb { Z } _ p [ \zeta ] </m> ? i tried to argue in following way : obviously observation provides <m> \Phi _ p ( g + 1 ) = 0 </m> and the formula above gives <m> \Phi _ p ( x + 1 ) = p + \binom { p } { 2 } x + \binom { p } { 3 } x ^ 2 + \dots + \binom { p } { p - 1 } x ^ { p - 2 } + x ^ { p - 1 } </m> . in light of this i can conclude following inclusions : <m> p \mathbb { Z } _ p [ \zeta ] \subset g \mathbb { Z } _ p [ \zeta ] </m> and <m> \pi ^ { p - 1 } \mathbb { Z } _ p [ \zeta ] \subset p \mathbb { Z } _ p [ \zeta ] </m> which imply <m> ( g \mathbb { Z } _ p [ \zeta ] ) \cap \mathbb { Z } _ p = p \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> . from here i 'm stuck .
my understanding -LRB- from a talk by rob bradley -RRB- is that cauchy is responsible for the now-standard <m> \epsilon { - } \delta </m> formulation of calculus , introduced in his 1821 cours d'analyse . although perhaps instead it was introduced by bolzano a few years earlier . my question is not about who was first with this notation , but rather :
this is also the space of real , symmetric bilinear forms in <m> \Bbb R ^ n </m> .
while dealing with another problem i saw that i need to classify subspaces <m> V </m> of <m> \mathbb { C } ^ { n \times n } </m> that are multiplicatively closed . so to get an idea of the nature of the subspaces i noticed that even for <m> \mathbb { C } ^ { 2 \times 2 } </m> the question does not have an obvious answer to me . clearly , the <m> 0 </m> and <m> 4 </m> dimensional space are closed -LRB- under multiplication -RRB- , in the one-dimensional space , the only closed one appears to be the one generated by the identity . but for <m> 2 </m> or <m> 3 </m> dimensional subspaces this question is really a mess -LRB- at least if you want to answer it `` by hand '' -RRB- . so i was wondering whether there is a more abstract view on this whole topic . since this question is rather accessible , i suspect that it is well-studied , but i could not find the right words to get a `` google-match '' as the results are always messed up with scalar multiplicatively closedness .
let <m> X </m> be a topological space with a triangulation . the triangulation defines a chain complex in <m> X </m> . let <m> \mu _ d </m> be a cochain and <m> M ^ d </m> be a chain . we use <m> < \mu _ d , M ^ d > \in M </m> to denote the evaluation of the cochain <m> \mu _ d </m> on the chain <m> M ^ d </m> . here <m> M </m> is a module and <m> M = R / Z </m> . a <m> \pi </m> - cocycle <m> \mu _ d </m> is defined as a cochain that satisfy <m> < \mu _ d , M ^ d > = < \mu _ d , N ^ d > </m> for any pair of cycles <m> M ^ d </m> and <m> N ^ d </m> that can `` deform '' into each other continuously . in contrast , a cocycle <m> \nu _ d </m> is a cochain that satisfy <m> < \nu _ d , M ^ d > = < \nu _ d , N ^ d > </m> for any <m> M ^ d </m> and <m> N ^ d </m> such that <m> M ^ d - N ^ d </m> is a boundary . let <m> W _ d </m> be the collection of <m> \pi </m> - cocycles . let <m> Z _ d </m> be the collection of cocycles . let <m> B _ d </m> be the collection of coboundaries . we have <m> B _ d \subset Z _ d \subset W _ d </m> . <m> H ^ d ( X , M ) = Z _ d / B _ d </m> is the usual cohomology class . <m> { \cal H } ^ d ( X , M ) = W _ d / B _ d </m> is the new <m> \pi </m> - cohomology class . is such <m> \pi </m> - cohomology class a well defined concept ? was it already studied under a different name ? thanks !

there are several constructions of the prüfer group <m> \mathbb { Z } / p ^ \infty </m> ; here are two that are relevant for this question .
can any bounded area defined by polynomial inequality in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> be partitioned into simply connected finite areas such that for each simply finite area there exist a diffeomorphic map that maps the area to a m-sphere ? bounded means the area <m> A < \infty </m> with the boundary defined by the polynomials . to partition means to partition with k-dimension manifold -LRB- <m> k = m - 1 </m> -RRB- as boundary -LRB- the intersection of the two subset -RRB- .
let <m> k = \Bbb F _ q </m> be a finite field , <m> \mathcal { G } </m> be a reductive group over <m> k </m> , denote <m> m ( G ) </m> by the minimal dimension of faithful representation of <m> G = \mathcal { G } ( \Bbb F _ q ) </m> . do we know the value <m> m ( G ( F _ q ) ) </m> explicitly at least in the <m> G L _ n </m> case ? for example , by classification of irreducible complex representations of <m> G L _ 2 ( \Bbb F _ q ) </m> -LRB- assume <m> q </m> is not power of <m> 2 </m> -RRB- , we know <m> m ( G L _ 2 ( \Bbb F _ q ) ) = q - 1 </m> -LRB- a suitable cuspidal representation of dimension <m> q - 1 </m> is faithful -RRB- .
i 've tried posting this question on mse , but did n't manage to get an answer there , so i 'm trying again here . sorry in advance if this question is trivial or trivially false . i have n't managed to find a satisfactory proof -LRB- or reference of one -RRB- , or a counterexample for it . let <m> k </m> be the algebraic closure of the finite field <m> \newcommand { \dbF } { \mathbb { F } } \dbF _ q </m> , of characteristic <m> p </m> . if necessary , assume <m> p \gg 0 </m> . let <m> G </m> be a simple algebraic group over <m> k </m> and let <m> \sigma </m> be an endmomorphism of <m> G </m> such that the <m> \sigma </m> - fixed <m> G _ \sigma </m> subgroup of <m> G </m> is finite . my question let <m> N \subseteq G </m> be a unipotent conjugacy class . does <m> N </m> contain an element <m> n \in N </m> which is fixed under <m> \sigma </m> ? note that , by -LSB- 1 , i , 3.4 -RSB- , it is enough to show that <m> N </m> is stable under the action of <m> \sigma </m> . this question has a positive answer for <m> G = G L _ n </m> , with the ordinary frobenius map <m> ( a _ { i , j } ) \mapsto ( a _ { i , j } ^ q ) </m> since conjuagcy classes of matrices over and algebraically closed field are parametrized by the jordan normal forms , and the jordan normal form of a unipotent element is clearly <m> \sigma </m> - fixed . more generally , if <m> G </m> is split over <m> \dbF _ q </m> , i think the question still has a positive answer , since any unipotent element can be conjugated to an element of the form <m> \prod _ { \alpha \in \Phi ^ + } x _ \alpha ( \lambda _ \alpha ) </m> , where <m> \Phi ^ + </m> is the set of positive roots with respect to an <m> \dbF _ q </m> - split maximal torus within a <m> \sigma </m> - stable borel . i have n't checked this thoroughly , but i think that at this point , by acting by conjugation by elements of the maximal torus , we may assume that the <m> \lambda _ \alpha </m> 's are in <m> \dbF _ q </m> , and , since <m> \sigma </m> - does n't permute the roots in <m> \Phi </m> , this element is <m> \sigma </m> - fixed . i 'm not sure how to extend this type of argument to non-split groups ove <m> \dbF _ q </m> , but checking small cases of the unitary group , it seems like the question continues to be true for these cases . in any case , i 'm not sure where to go on from here , and i 'm not sure that the type of argument i 'm trying to pursue here is indeed true , so i would appreciate any type of input anyone would be willing to offer . thank you !
the construction quoted in the question `` how to sample a uniform random polyomino ? '' claims to produce a `` uniform random polyomino '' . but apart from the mentioned possibility of getting stuck , it also seems to me that the polyominoes obtained by this construction tend to contain less <m> 2 \times 2 </m> squares than average . this is because if three cells of such a square are already selected during the construction , there seem to be fairly high chances that the fourth cell already has a number smaller than the last picked one -LRB- and thus can never be picked -RRB- . e.g. after having chosen 1 and 3 in the given example , the only chance to obtain a <m> 2 \times 2 </m> square here is to pick 4 and then 8 . and there are only quite few other <m> 2 \times 2 </m> squares at all which might be obtained similarly at some stage of this -LRB- admittedly very particular -RRB- construction . my impression may be wrong , but in any case , without clinging to the quoted construction , it makes me wondering about the following :
so what is needed to demonstrate something -LRB- say like <m> L _ { \omega _ 1 ^ { C K } } [ a ] </m> is a <m> \omega </m> - models of <m> \mathbf { \Sigma ^ 1 _ 1 } </m> - <m> D C </m> or <m> \mathbf { \Delta ^ 1 _ 1 } </m> - <m> C A </m> ? it 's not like i do n't understand what the terms mean but i suspect there is a nice property that will suffice , at least for admissible ordinals with extra reals stuck on . also i 've been told that this is closely related to the question of whether the set is admissible . however , i 've found very little reference material on admissible sets that is n't merely about admissible ordinals , i.e. , looks at sets like <m> L _ { \omega _ 1 ^ { C K } } [ a ] </m> -RRB- . i 'm sure that the best way forward here is n't manually verifying all the axioms for kp so any hints ? for the reader 's info this is coming from friedman 's 102 problems in mathematical logic numbers 64 and 65 . my advisor claims to have answered these in a short cryptic note and i had to write up his general method for another problem so i want to include these corollaries but i still feel too fuzzy about them to write anything up .
let <m> p , q , r , s , t </m> be primes , i w 'd like to know if the following equation has solutions in integers : for <m> n \geq 2 : p ^ n + q ^ n = r ^ n + s ^ n + t ^ n </m> exactly if there are finitely many integers <m> n </m> satisfy the titled equation ? . note : even now i know that it has no solution with <m> n = 2 </m> !!!!! short proof : for <m> n = 2 </m> no solutions existed note first that : if <m> p , q , r , s , t </m> are primes and <m> q + q = r + s + t </m> then each of the numbers <m> p </m> and <m> q </m> must be different from each of the numbers <m> r , s , t </m> in fact , if we had , for instance if we had <m> p = r </m> then we would also have <m> q + s = t </m> , which is impossible since this equation can not have solution in primes <m> q , s </m> and <m> t </m> indeed , the numbers <m> s </m> and <m> t </m> could not be both odd nor could they be both even -LRB- since in this case we would have <m> q = 2 </m> which is impossible in view of the fact that the right-hand side is <m> > 4 </m> if we had <m> s = 2 </m> then the number <m> 4 </m> would be a difference of two squares of positive integers which is impossible . now : if <m> p + q = s + r + t </m> , then it is not possible that all numbers <m> p , q , r , s , t </m> are odd . if <m> p </m> is even , then <m> p = 2 </m> , and the numbers <m> q , r , s , t </m> are odd . since the square of an odd number gives the remainder <m> 1 </m> upon dividing by <m> 8 </m> , the left-hand side would give the remainder <m> 5 </m> , and the right-hand side would give the remainder <m> 3 </m> , which is impossible . if both <m> p </m> and <m> q </m> are odd , then the left-hand side gives the remainder <m> 2 </m> upon dividing by <m> 8 </m> , while on the right-hand side one -LRB- and only one -RRB- of the numbers must be even , for instance <m> r = 2 </m> . then , however , the right-hand side would give the remainder <m> 6 </m> upon dividing by <m> 8 </m> , which is impossible . edit just i have tried to show that for <m> n = 2 </m> no solutions existed in integers thank you for any help
this is just a reference request ; i have no sharp mathematical question . inspired by the <m> ( 3 + ) </m> - year old mo question , in knot theory : benefits of working in <m> S ^ 3 </m> instead of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 3 </m> ? , i would like to ask :

classically : let <m> a _ 1 , . . . , a _ r </m> be points in <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 _ { \mathbb { C } } </m> , and let <m> \alpha _ 1 , . . . , \alpha _ r </m> be simple loops around the <m> a _ i </m> , all counterclockwise , and none touching -LRB- so <m> \alpha _ 1 . . . \alpha _ r = 1 </m> in the fundamental group of the projective line minus those points -RRB- . an -LRB- pointed , to be pedantic -RRB- unramified <m> G </m> - cover -LRB- meaning a normal covering space with deck transformations <m> = G </m> -RRB- of <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 _ { \mathbb { C } } - a _ 1 , . . . , a _ r </m> is given by a surjection <m> \pi _ 1 ( \mathbb { P } ^ 1 _ { \mathbb { C } } - a _ 1 , . . . , a _ r ) \rightarrow G </m> . let <m> g _ i </m> be the image of <m> \alpha _ i </m> . we say that this <m> G </m> - galois branched cover has branch cycle description <m> ( g _ 1 , . . . , g _ r ) </m> -LRB- note that this depends on our choice of the <m> \alpha _ i </m> 's -RRB- . this covering map of curves can be extended to a map of -LRB- smooth -RRB- projective groups . it can then be shown by a simple topological argument that <m> g _ i </m> generates the inertia group -LRB- = decomposition group in this case -RRB- of some point above <m> a _ i </m> . my question is whether -LRB- and if so , how ? -RRB- this is also true for the <m> \overline { \mathbb { F } _ p } </m> case . let me be precise . it is known via grothendieck that <m> \pi _ 1 ^ { ( p ) } ( \mathbb { P } ^ 1 _ { \overline { \mathbb { F } _ p } } - a _ 1 , . . . , a _ r ) = \widehat { \langle \alpha _ 1 , . . . , \alpha _ r | \prod \alpha _ i = 1 \rangle } ^ { ( p ) } </m> -LRB- the <m> ^ { ( p ) } </m> indicates that we 're taking the inverse limit of all prime-to - <m> p </m> finite quotients -RRB- . since these <m> \alpha _ i </m> 's are given in sga1 through a rather mysterious method , i wonder if the phenomenon described in the first paragraph is still true . my question , therefore , is : let <m> G </m> be a prime-to - <m> p </m> group , and let <m> X \rightarrow \mathbb { P } ^ 1 _ { \overline { \mathbb { F } _ p } } </m> be a -LRB- pointed , to be pedantic -RRB- branched <m> G </m> - cover with branch points <m> a _ 1 , . . . , a _ r </m> . let <m> \alpha _ 1 , . . . , \alpha _ r </m> be such that <m> \pi _ 1 ^ { ( p ) } ( \mathbb { P } ^ 1 _ { \overline { \mathbb { F } _ p } } - a _ 1 , . . . , a _ r ) = \widehat { \langle \alpha _ 1 , . . . , \alpha _ r | \prod \alpha _ i = 1 \rangle } ^ { ( p ) } </m> -LRB- i 'm almost positive that what i 'm about to say is false if you 're allowed to choose any such <m> \alpha _ i </m> 's , so let 's assume that we 're taking the ones from grothendieck 's construction . if you see a better way of saying what the condition should be on the <m> \alpha _ i </m> 's i would be very interested in that -RRB- . let the branch cycle description of this cover be <m> ( g _ 1 , . . . , g _ r ) </m> -LRB- with respect to these <m> \alpha _ i </m> 's -RRB- . is it true that <m> g _ i </m> generates the inertia group -LRB- = decomposition group in this case -RRB- of some point of <m> X </m> above <m> a _ i </m> ? the topological argument that we were able to use for the <m> \mathbb { C } </m> case seems to no longer apply ...
i am aware that the following result is a classical one -LRB- by now -RRB- . but i am not able to understand who proved it . what should be a proper reference to this statement ? theorem . let <m> M ^ 4 </m> be a compact symplectic manifold with <m> \pi _ 1 \ne 0 </m> and let <m> S _ 1 </m> and <m> S _ 2 </m> be two symplectic spheres embedded in it with <m> S _ 1 ^ 2 = S _ 2 ^ 2 = 0 </m> . then <m> S _ 1 </m> and <m> S _ 2 </m> are symplectically isotopic in <m> M ^ 4 </m> . in other words , is there an article/book -LRB- say pre 2000 -RRB- claiming that any two symplectic spheres with zero self-intersection in an irrational ruled -LRB- non-minimal -RRB- surface are symplectically isotopic ?
if <m> f \in </m> diff -LRB- <m> M </m> -RRB- , where <m> M </m> is manifold , if <m> C ^ 1 </m> perturbation <m> f _ { \epsilon } </m> of <m> f </m> s.t. <m> | | f _ { \epsilon } - f | | _ { C ^ 1 } < \epsilon </m> . can we prove <m> f _ { \epsilon } \in </m> diff -LRB- <m> M </m> -RRB- if <m> \epsilon </m> is small enough ?
let <m> f : \mathbb { R ^ 2 } \mapsto \mathbb { R } </m> be continuous and have partial derivatives in <m> D = \{ ( x , y ) : x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 \leq 1 \} </m> , and let <m> \mathscr { H } </m> the set of such functions for which <m> \sup _ D | f | \leq 1 </m> . could someone calculate <m> \sup \limits _ { f \in \mathscr { H } } \inf \limits _ { z \in D } [ f _ x ^ 2 ( z ) + f _ y ^ 2 ( z ) ] \; ? </m> current work : i have an rigorous proof that it is less than 16 . proof as follows : define <m> F ( x , y ) = f ( x , y ) + 2 ( x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 ) </m> . we have <m> F ( 0 , 0 ) \leq 1 </m> and <m> F | _ { \partial D } \geq 1 </m> , which mean that minimun can be obtained in the interior . therefore , we have an interior point <m> ( x _ 0 , y _ 0 ) </m> s.t. <m> F _ x ( x _ 0 , y _ 0 ) = F _ y ( x _ 0 , y _ 0 ) = 0 . </m> then <m> f _ x ( x _ 0 , y _ 0 ) = - 4 x _ 0 , f _ y ( x _ 0 , y _ 0 ) = - 4 y _ 0 </m> <m> f _ x ^ 2 ( x _ 0 , y _ 0 ) + f _ y ^ 2 ( x _ 0 , y _ 0 ) = 1 6 ( x _ 0 ^ 2 + y _ 0 ^ 2 ) < 1 6 . </m> q.e.d. intuition : however , the upper bound may be too rough . we could always find some point where <m> f _ x ^ 2 + f _ y ^ 2 </m> is small . if there is some place slopes fast , then the restriction of <m> f </m> means there is always somewhere plain . examples like <m> f ( x , y ) = x , y </m> or <m> \displaystyle \frac { x + y } { \sqrt { 2 } } </m> all have <m> f _ x ^ 2 + f _ y ^ 2 </m> with 1 .
i want to know about low-weight galois representations in <m> H ^ i ( \overline { \mathcal M } _ { g , n } , \overline { \mathbb Q } _ \ell ) </m> that are n't cyclotomic . this should be equivalent to finding <m> p , q </m> such that <m> H ^ { p , q } ( \overline { \mathcal M } _ { g , n } ) \neq 0 </m> , <m> p \neq q </m> , and <m> p + q </m> is small , or to finding non-algebraic cohomology classes in <m> H ^ i ( \overline { \mathcal M } _ { g , n } , \mathbb Q ) </m> for small <m> i </m> . my question is : what 's the smallest weight / degree that can occur ? for <m> g = 0 </m> , this never happens . for <m> g = 1 </m> , the cohomology comes from modular forms of level <m> 1 </m> , and the lowest weight one is weight <m> 1 1 </m> , arising from the modular form <m> \Delta ( q ) </m> . for <m> g \geq 2 </m> , i do n't know if you can do better than <m> 1 1 </m> . i 'd also be intersted in knowing about especially low weight galois representations that do n't arise from classical modular forms , even if their weight is larger than <m> 1 1 </m> . i think the lowest one i know about is weight <m> 1 9 </m> on <m> \overline { \mathcal M } _ { 2 , 1 6 } </m> from a siegel modular form . should i expect the weights to keep increasing as <m> g </m> goes to infinity , so that these are the smallest ones ? i became interested in these because they are natural examples of everywhere unramified galois representations arising from geometry , and the lowest weight ones seem like the simplest in some sense . i 'd also like to know the answer purely to get a better intuition about the cohomology of these spaces .
inspired by this question , let us take a nontrivial 3-cocycle <m> \omega _ 3 ^ G ( g _ a , g _ b , g _ c ) \in H ^ 3 ( G , \mathbb { R } / \mathbb { Z } ) </m> in the cohomology group of <m> G </m> with <m> U ( 1 ) = \mathbb { R } / \mathbb { Z } </m> coefficient . in otherwords , here the 3-cocycle <m> \omega _ 3 ^ G </m> is a complex <m> U ( 1 ) = \mathbb { R } / \mathbb { Z } </m> function with the norm <m> | \omega _ 3 ^ G | = 1 </m> but with a <m> U ( 1 ) </m> complex phase satisfying the cocycle condition . here <m> g _ a , g _ b , g _ c \in G </m> . we like to ask how can we trivialize the 3-cocycle <m> \omega _ 3 ( g _ a , g _ b , g _ c ) </m> of <m> G </m> into 3-coboundary if we lift <m> G </m> into a larger group <m> J </m> , and given that we know the group homomorphism <m> r </m> :
let <m> A </m> be a <m> C ^ * </m> algebra and <m> A ' ' </m> be its bidual with the arens product . is there any relation between the hochschild cohomolgy of <m> A </m> with complex coefficients and the hochschild cohomology of <m> A ' ' </m> ?
how can i prove the following : <m> d ^ { i j } ( m , k ) > d ^ { j i } ( m , k ) </m> for all <m> k < \frac { 1 } { 2 } \binom { m } { 2 } , </m> where <m> d ^ { i j } ( m , k ) </m> denotes the number of permutations of <m> ( 1 , \ldots , i , \ldots , j , \ldots , m ) </m> with <m> k </m> inversions and where <m> i </m> is on the left of <m> j . </m> similarly <m> d ^ { j i } ( m , k ) </m> denotes the number of permutations where <m> i </m> is on the right to <m> j . </m> example : <m> m = 4 </m> , <m> k = 1 . </m> we have the following permutations <m> 2 1 3 4 , 1 2 4 3 , 1 3 2 4 . </m> so , <m> d ^ { 1 2 } ( 4 , 1 ) = 2 </m> and <m> d ^ { 2 1 } ( 4 , 1 ) = 1 . </m>
background : let <m> X </m> be an algebraic variety over a finite field <m> \mathbb { F } _ q </m> . one of the successes of etale cohomology - previously achieved by dwork - was proving the rationality of the zeta function of x , defined as <m> Z ( X , t ) = \textrm { e x p } \left ( \sum _ { n \geq 1 } \frac { | X ( \mathbb { F } _ { q ^ n } ) | t ^ n } { n } \right ) . </m> as a corollary , we get the rationality of <m> t Z ' ( X , t ) / Z ( X , t ) </m> , which is the sum <m> P ( X , t ) = \sum _ n | X ( \mathbb { F } _ { q ^ n } ) | t ^ n . </m> question : is there an elementary way to see that <m> P ( x , t ) </m> is a rational function ? note that this is strictly weaker than asking whether <m> Z ( X , t ) </m> is a rational function .
let <m> X = G / H </m> for a reductive group <m> G </m> and <m> X </m> is normal and has an open <m> B </m> - orbit , for a borel subgroup <m> B </m> then we call <m> X </m> spherical .
this is a somewhat more explicit version of a question i have recently asked . let <m> p </m> be an odd prime , and write <m> \zeta : = \exp ( 2 \pi i / p ) </m> -LRB- any other primitive <m> p </m> th root of unity will do as well -RRB- . for integer <m> n \in [ 0 , p ] </m> , the products <m> { \mathcal P } _ p ( n ) : = \prod _ { \substack { A \subseteq { \mathbb F } _ p \, | A | = n } } \ \sum _ { a \in A } \zeta ^ a </m> are rational integers ; can they be found `` explicitly '' ? it is immediately seen that <m> { \mathcal P } _ p ( 0 ) = 0 </m> and <m> { \mathcal P } _ p ( 1 ) = 1 </m> , and i can show that <m> { \mathcal P } _ p ( 2 ) = \left ( \frac 2 p \right ) </m> -LRB- it is not difficult to see that <m> { \mathcal P } _ p ( 2 ) = \pm 1 </m> , but to determine the sign is trickier -RRB- . also , we have <m> { \mathcal P } _ p ( p - n ) = ( - 1 ) ^ { \binom { p } { n } } { \mathcal P } _ p ( n ) </m> , so that <m> { \mathcal P } _ p ( p ) = 0 </m> , <m> { \mathcal P } _ p ( p - 1 ) = - 1 </m> , and <m> { \mathcal P } _ p ( p - 2 ) = \pm 1 </m> .
let <m> E </m> be an elliptic curve defined over <m> F </m> with cm by <m> \mathcal { O } _ K </m> where <m> K </m> is an imaginary quadratic field . we may assume the <m> F </m> contains <m> K </m> and also contains the <m> p </m> - division points , where <m> p </m> is a good ordinary prime . when <m> K </m> has class number 1 , schnepps ' -LRB- and gillard 's -RRB- results tell us that the <m> \mu </m> - invariant of the dual selmer over the division field extension -LRB- the split prime -RRB- is zero . is it reasonable to believe that the <m> \mu </m> - invariant for the dual selmer over the cyclotomic extension is zero as well for a cm elliptic curve ?
let <m> \{ v _ m \} _ { m \in \mathbb { N } } \subset \ell ^ 2 </m> be a sequence in <m> \ell ^ 2 </m> over the complex plane <m> \mathbb { C } </m> such that : <m> \{ v _ m \} _ { m \in \mathbb { N } } </m> is linearly independend and <m> v _ m \to v </m> let <m> V = \operatorname { s p a n } \{ v _ m \} _ { m \in \mathbb { N } } </m> let <m> \{ u _ p \} _ { p \in \mathbb { N } } \subset V </m> be a sequence in <m> V </m> such that <m> u _ p \to u </m> so we have <m> \forall p \in \mathbb { N } : u _ p = \sum _ { m = 1 } ^ \infty \left ( a _ { p , m } \cdot v _ m \right ) </m> with <m> a _ { m , p } \in \mathbb { C } </m> and for each fixed <m> p \in \mathbb { N } </m> there are only finitely many <m> m </m> with <m> a _ { p , m } \neq 0 </m> further , we have for each fixed <m> m \in \mathbb { N } </m> <m> \lim _ { p \to \infty } a _ { p , m } = 0 </m> my question is if it is true that : <m> \lim _ { p \to \infty } u _ p = a \cdot v </m> with <m> a \in \mathbb { C } </m> thanks .
consider the differential operator <m> D : </m> <m> D u : = \frac { - d ^ 2 } { d x ^ 2 } u </m> on the function space <m> C = \{ u \in C ^ 2 ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) : u ( 0 ) = u ( 1 ) = 0 \} . </m> it 's not hard to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors -LRB- eigenfunctions -RRB- for <m> D </m> by soloving the eigenvalue problem : <m> - u ' ' = \lambda u \qquad u ( 0 ) = u ( 1 ) = 0 . </m> here are my questions :
take <m> S ^ 2 </m> with its standard metric . the space of great circles in <m> S ^ 2 </m> can be identified with the real projective plane <m> \mathbb { R } P ^ 2 </m> . let <m> X </m> be an embedded circle in <m> S ^ 2 </m> ; associate to it a function <m> f _ X : \mathbb { R } P ^ 2 \rightarrow \mathbb { Z } \cup \{ \infty \} </m> which counts the number of intersection points -LRB- with multiplicity -RRB- of <m> X </m> with given great circle . can we reconstruct <m> X </m> from <m> f _ X </m> ? remark : i think from some version of crofton formula , it should be possible to determine the length of <m> X </m> from <m> f _ X </m> .

hey i am trying to find out how the baum-connes conjecture works over <m> G L ( 1 ) </m> over local fiels . i am just wondering if anybody knows how to get a countable many generators for in the l.h.s of the baum-connes conjecture over <m> G L ( 1 ) </m> : <m> \mu : K _ { j } ^ { G } ( \beta G ) \to K _ { j } ( C _ { r } ^ { * } G ) </m> , where the <m> L . H . S . </m> is the <m> K </m> - homology of the tree for <m> G L ( 1 ) </m> , and the r.h.s. is the <m> K </m> - theory group of reduce <m> C ^ { * } </m> - algebra of same group <m> G </m> . thanks a lot .
an old problem -LRB- recently `` reheated '' by casas-alvero , etc. -RRB- consists of trying to determine if degree <m> n </m> polynomials <m> P ( t ) </m> that are <m> n </m> - th powers are characterized by the following condition : <m> \deg ( g c d ( P ( t ) , P ^ { ( r ) } ( t ) ) ) > 0 </m> for all positive integers <m> r </m> and <m> r \neq n , </m> where <m> P ^ { ( r ) } ( t ) </m> is the <m> r </m> - th formal derivative of <m> P ( t ) </m> relative to <m> t </m> . seems that the case when the field of coefficients is the prime field <m> G F ( p ) </m> has not been considered . by chance i got the following polynomial <m> P _ { 3 7 } ( t ) \in G F ( 3 7 ) [ t ] </m> that proves the -LRB- conjectural -RRB- result false : <m> P _ { 3 7 } ( t ) = 1 7 t ^ { 1 2 } + 2 1 t ^ 4 + 2 4 t ^ 3 + 1 2 t ^ 2 \in G F ( 3 7 ) [ t ] </m> we have indeed : <m> \deg ( \gcd ( P _ { 3 7 } ( t ) , P _ { 3 7 } ^ { ( r ) } ( t ) ) \geq 1 </m> in <m> G F ( 3 7 ) [ t ] </m> for all <m> r = 1 , 2 , \ldots , 1 1 </m> and trivially for <m> r > 1 3 . </m> but , <m> P _ { 3 7 } ( t ) </m> is not a <m> 1 2 </m> - th power in <m> G F ( 3 7 ) [ t ] . </m> more precisely : <m> \gcd ( P ( t ) , P ^ { ' } ( t ) ) = t , \quad \gcd ( P ( t ) , P ^ { ' ' } ( t ) = t + 3 6 , </m> <m> \gcd ( P ( t ) , P ^ { ( 3 ) } ( t ) ) = t + 3 6 , \quad \gcd ( P , P ^ { ( 4 ) } ( t ) = t + 3 6 , </m> and all other <m> \gcd ( P ( t ) , P ^ { ( r ) } ( t ) ) = t </m> for <m> r = 5 , \ldots , 1 1 </m> and for <m> r > 1 2 . </m> question : there are other such examples ? . can be characterized ?
let <m> L </m> be a finite field of characteristic <m> 2 </m> . suppose that for some <m> k > 0 </m> we are given elements <m> A ( 0 ) , \, A ( 1 ) , \dots , \, A ( k - 1 ) </m> and <m> c ( 0 ) , \, c ( 1 ) , \dots , \, c ( k - 1 ) </m> of <m> L [ t ] </m> . define <m> A ( n ) </m> inductively by <m> A ( n + k ) = \sum c ( j ) A ( n + j ) </m> . i 'll say that <m> n </m> is a `` jump number '' if <m> A ( n ) </m> is an <m> L </m> - linear combination of <m> A ( r ) </m> with <m> r < n </m> . let <m> J </m> in <m> L [ [ x ] ] </m> be <m> \sum x ^ n </m> , where the exponents are the jump numbers . questions : is there a decision procedure for determining from the initial data above whether <m> J </m> is algebraic over the field <m> L ( x ) </m> ? and when it is , for determining an equation that it satisfies over <m> L ( x ) </m> ? example : suppose that <m> A ( 0 ) = A ( 1 ) = A ( 2 ) = 0 </m> , that <m> A ( 3 ) = t </m> , and that <m> A ( n + 4 ) = t ^ 4 A ( n ) + t A ( n + 1 ) </m> . the first few odd jump numbers are <m> 1 , 5 , 1 7 , 2 1 , 6 5 , 6 9 , 8 1 , 8 5 </m> . a corollary of the -LRB- technically difficult but elementary -RRB- study , by nicolas and serre , of the action of the hecke operator t3 on mod <m> 2 </m> modular forms of level <m> 1 </m> is that the set of jump numbers consists of <m> 0 </m> together with the <m> 2 ^ a ( 1 + 4 b ) </m> where <m> b </m> runs over the sums of distinct powers of <m> 4 </m> . it follows from this that the cube of <m> J + J ^ 2 </m> is <m> x ^ 3 / ( 1 + x ^ 4 ) </m> . so algebraicity holds in this case . remark : it seems implausible that <m> J </m> is always algebraic over <m> L ( x ) </m> . but in a number of examples that i 've looked at , particularly those where the recursions come from the action of hecke operators , as in the example , there is computer evidence for <m> J </m> being algebraic . one may also replace <m> L </m> by a finite field of odd characteristic , and ask the same questions .
let <m> X </m> be a finite set of positive integers . define <m> X \bmod k </m> as multiset of positive integers obtained by mod operation on every element of <m> X </m> . for example , -LCB- 3 , 5 , 8 -RCB- <m> \bmod </m> 3 = -LCB- 0 , 2 , 2 -RCB- . two multisets are equal iff they have the same elements with identical frequency . let <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> be two subsets of -LCB- 1 , 2 , 3 , ... , n - 1 , n -RCB- such that <m> | A | = | B | = m </m> , <m> A \cap B = \emptyset </m> . what is the minimum <m> k </m> -LRB- as a function of <m> n </m> and <m> m </m> -RRB- such that the multisets <m> A \bmod k \neq B \bmod k </m> . consider for example <m> A </m> = -LCB- 2 , 4 , 11 , 15 -RCB- and <m> B </m> = -LCB- 6 , 8 , 13 , 17 -RCB- for which <m> A \bmod i = B \bmod i </m> , for <m> i = 2 , 3 </m> but <m> A \bmod 4 \neq B \bmod 4 </m> . i also posted the question at math.stackexchange . for <m> m </m> = 1 , <m> k = O ( \log n ) </m> .

the following is a question i have asked here without receiving any comments , therefore i post it here : let <m> A \subseteq B </m> be commutative rings , <m> m </m> a maximal ideal of <m> A </m> . when <m> m B \neq B </m> ? this is true when <m> A \subseteq B </m> is faithfully flat . -LRB- if i am not wrong , this is also true when <m> A \subseteq B </m> is integral -RRB- . any other ideas are welcome . please notice : a similar -LRB- but not identical , i think -RRB- question is : https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/194261/when-does-mathfrakab-cap-a-mathfraka/194306#194306 , since the property i am talking about is slightly more general then <m> I B \cap A = I </m> , for every ideal <m> I </m> of <m> A </m> . indeed , let <m> m </m> be a maximal ideal of <m> A </m> . then , in particular , <m> m B \cap A = m </m> and if <m> m B = B </m> we would get <m> A = B \cap A = m B \cap A = m </m> , a contradiction to the maximality of <m> m </m> . so , '' <m> I B \cap A = I </m> implies <m> m B \neq B </m> '' . -LRB- an exercise in atiyah-macdonald , which was mentioned in the second answer of https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/194261/when-does-mathfrakab-cap-a-mathfraka/194306#194306 shows that for a flat extension those two properties are equivalent -RRB- .
let <m> \Gamma ( G ; ( G _ i ) _ { i \in I } ) </m> be a coset geometry -LRB- in the sense of buekenhout -RRB- firm , residually connected and flag transitive with borel subgroup <m> B </m> . consider <m> H </m> any subgroup of <m> B </m> . i want to find all the elements <m> \rho _ i </m> in the minimal parabolics subgroups <m> G _ { I - \{ i \} } </m> such that <m> [ \langle H , \rho _ i \rangle : H ] = 2 </m> . i have been given an idea : consider the quotient <m> G _ { I - \{ i \} } / B </m> together with the canonical homomorphism <m> \phi _ i : G _ { I - \{ i \} } \to G _ { I - \{ i \} } / B </m> . then keep all the elements <m> \rho _ i \in G _ { I - \{ i \} } - B </m> such that <m> \phi _ i ( \rho _ i ) </m> is an involution . in order to find them , take all involutions in <m> G _ { I - \{ i \} } / B </m> , then take their preimage by <m> \phi _ i </m> and it then suffices to multiply the preimage by the elements in the kernel of <m> \phi _ i </m> and keep those which normalize <m> H </m> to get the elements satisfying the condition given above . however , i have two problems . first , i do n't really see why this works . second is that i have no guarantee that <m> B </m> is normal in each minimal parabolic subgroup . worse , most of the time it is not . hence , the set of right cosets of <m> B </m> in <m> G _ { I - \{ i \} } </m> does not have a group structure . therefore , i have some problem with this solution . does anyone have a suggestion ? thanks in advance .
given a set <m> S </m> of <m> n </m> elements . let <m> T </m> be the set of all subsets of <m> S </m> , with size <m> \frac { n } { 2 } </m> -LRB- <m> n </m> is even -RRB- . we want to select a subset <m> T ' </m> of <m> T </m> , with the property that for any pair of the elements <m> x , y \in S </m> , there exists a subset <m> Q \in T ' </m> , such that <m> x \in Q </m> and <m> y \in Q </m> . what is the minimum size of <m> T ' </m> ? in particular , is <m> | T ' | < n </m> ?
let <m> A \in \mathbb { R } ^ { n \times n } </m> be a symmetric matrix , and consider the <m> l _ p </m> norm -LRB- <m> p \geq 2 </m> -RRB- . can we prove that the following problems are equivalent : <m> \max _ { \| x \| _ p = \| y \| _ p = 1 } \left | \langle x , A y \rangle \right | </m> and <m> \max _ { \| x \| _ p = 1 } \left | \langle x , A x \rangle \right | </m> can the result be generalized to symmetric tensor and symmetric multilinear form ? in particular , if <m> F : R ^ n \times \cdots \times R ^ n </m> is a <m> m </m> - order symmetric multilinear form , can we prove the problem <m> \max _ { \| x _ 1 \| _ p = \cdots = \| x _ m \| _ p = 1 } \left | F ( x _ 1 , \ldots , x _ m ) \right | </m> is equivalent to <m> \max _ { \| x \| _ p = 1 } \left | F ( x , \ldots , x ) \right | </m> if not , can we prove if for any special case ? -LRB- the case <m> p \neq 2 </m> would be more interesting . -RRB- thank you very much ! ps : i would even highly appreciate if someone could give me an example where the above statement fails .
let <m> \pi \colon X \to \mathbb { P } ^ 4 </m> be the blow-up of a smooth surface <m> S \subset \mathbb { P } ^ 4 </m> . is there a formula to compute <m> ( K _ X ) ^ 4 </m> ? -LRB- which should be dependent on invariants of <m> S </m> -RRB- . in dimension <m> 3 </m> , the formula is <m> ( K _ X ) ^ 3 = 6 2 - 8 d + 2 g </m> , where <m> d </m> is the degree of the curve and <m> g </m> is its genus .
background consider <m> B U = c o l i m \, B U _ k </m> where we take <m> B U _ k </m> to be the specific model of classifying space for the group <m> U ( k ) \subseteq O ( 2 k ) </m> given by the quotient space of the infinite real stiefel manifold <m> V _ { 2 k } </m> by the action of <m> U ( k ) </m> . the spaces <m> B U _ k </m> as described come with maps <m> f _ k : B U _ k \rightarrow B O _ { 2 k } </m> that are fibrations . with the above setup , we can define a <m> ( B U , f ) </m> - structure on a stable vector bundle <m> \xi : X \rightarrow B O _ { 2 k } </m> as a particular lift <m> \tilde { \xi } : X \rightarrow B U _ k </m> . we consider lifts <m> \tilde { \xi } _ 0 , \tilde { \xi } _ 1 </m> equivalent if there is <m> k > > 0 </m> and a fiberwise homotopy <m> H : X \times [ 0 , 1 ] \rightarrow B U _ k </m> between the two lifts . -LRB- fiberwise homotopy means <m> f _ k \circ H = \xi </m> -RRB- . there is a map <m> I : B O \rightarrow B O </m> given by sending a subspace <m> A \subseteq \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> to its orthogonal complement <m> A ^ { \perp } \subseteq \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> . the question in stong 's notes on cobordism theory , he shows that a <m> ( B U , f ) </m> - structure on the stable normal bundle is equivalent to an <m> ( I ^ * B U , f ^ * ) </m> - structure on the stable tangent bundle ; this is ok . is it possible , though , to construct a bijection between <m> ( B U , f ) </m> - structures on the stable normal bundle and <m> ( B U , f ) </m> - structures on the stable tangent bundle ? some thoughts for other kinds of <m> ( B , f ) </m> - structures it is doable , i believe . certainly for <m> ( B O , 1 ) </m> - structures you can do it . also , for <m> ( B S O , f ) </m> - structures you can do it . if <m> T X </m> is the tangent bundle of <m> X </m> and <m> N </m> is the normal bundle to <m> X </m> for some embedding in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { n + k } </m> , <m> k > > 0 </m> , one has a canonical trivialization <m> T X \oplus N \cong \epsilon ^ { n + k } </m> . as the trivial bundle has a canonical choice of orientation , given an orientation of <m> T X </m> , we can get an orientation on <m> N </m> by requiring the induced orientation on <m> \epsilon ^ { n + k } </m> agrees with the canonical one . one can do the same in the other direction . a note in davis & kirk claims you can do it for complex structures -LRB- exercise 137 -RRB- , but i do n't think the discussion is correct . it works for complex vector bundles , but that is weaker than having complex structures . e.g. the case of <m> X = p t </m> , with a trivial 2-dimensional bundle <m> \epsilon ^ 2 </m> . there are two possible -LRB- inequivalent -RRB- lifts of the bundle to <m> B U _ 1 </m> as defined above , but only one lift to <m> G _ 1 ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> .
let <m> X </m> be a fixed closed manifold , <m> S ( X ) </m> the structure set and <m> A u t ( X ) </m> the group of self homotopy equivalence of <m> X </m> . surgery theory tells us that <m> \mathcal { M } ( X ) : = S ( X ) / A u t ( X ) </m> is in bijection with the set of <m> h </m> - cobordism classes of manifolds homotopy equivalent to <m> X </m> . if <m> X </m> is simply connected and dim <m> X \geq 5 </m> , then by the <m> h </m> - cobordism theorem , <m> S ^ { T o p } ( X ) / A u t ( X ) </m> is in bijection with the homeomorphism classes of manifolds homotopy equivalent to <m> X </m> . we call manifold <m> M </m> a fake <m> X </m> if <m> M </m> is homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic to <m> X </m> . <m> S ^ { T o p } ( S ^ { 2 k + 1 } \times S ^ { 2 k + 1 } ) = 0 </m> , hence there is no fake <m> S ^ { 2 k + 1 } \times S ^ { 2 k + 1 } </m> . for <m> S ^ { 4 k } \times S ^ { 4 k } </m> , we have <m> S ^ { T o p } ( S ^ { 4 k } \times S ^ { 4 k } ) \cong \mathbb { Z } \oplus \mathbb { Z } </m> and <m> A u t ( S ^ { 4 k } \times S ^ { 4 k } ) </m> is finite group . this means <m> \mathcal { M } ( S ^ { 4 k } \times S ^ { 4 k } ) </m> is infinite .
let <m> p </m> be a prime number and <m> G = G L _ n ( \mathbb { Z } / p \mathbb { Z } ) </m> . consider the set <m> U </m> of upper-triangular matrices of <m> G </m> having entries of <m> 1 </m> on the diagonal . the cardinality of <m> U </m> is <m> p ^ { \frac { n ( n - 1 ) } 2 } </m> and <m> U </m> is a subgroup of <m> G </m> , in particular <m> U </m> is a sylow <m> p </m> - subgroup of <m> G </m> . it is well known that the sylow <m> p </m> - subgroups of a group <m> G </m> are conjugate , and every <m> p </m> - subgroup <m> H </m> of <m> G </m> is contained in some sylow <m> p </m> - subgroup of <m> G </m> . then there exists <m> g \in G </m> such that <m> H \leq g U g ^ { - 1 } </m> , which allows us to compute the number of conjugacy classes of elementary abelian subgroups of rank <m> 2 </m> -LRB- <m> H = ( \mathbb { Z } / p \mathbb { Z } ) ^ 2 </m> -RRB- in the sylow <m> p </m> - subgroup <m> U </m> . any help would be appreciated so much . thank you all .
given a symmetric monoidal <m> ( \infty , n ) </m> - category <m> \mathcal { D } </m> , one obtains a symmetric monoidal <m> ( \infty , n - 1 ) </m> - category <m> \Omega \mathcal { D } </m> by taking <m> \Omega \mathcal { D } = E n d _ { \mathcal { D } } ( 1 _ { \mathcal { D } } ) </m> , where <m> 1 _ { \mathcal { D } } </m> is the unit object of <m> D </m> . conversely , given a symmetric monoidal <m> ( \infty , n - 1 ) </m> - category <m> \mathcal { C } </m> , one obtains a symmetric monoidal <m> ( \infty , n ) </m> - category <m> B \mathcal { C } </m> by defining <m> B \mathcal { C } </m> to be the <m> ( \infty , n ) </m> - category with a single object with <m> \mathcal { C } </m> as category of morphisms . how are <m> \Omega </m> and <m> B </m> related ? clearly <m> \Omega B \mathcal { C } </m> is again <m> C </m> and <m> B \Omega \mathcal { D } </m> is the full monoidal subcategory of <m> \mathcal { D } </m> generated by the object <m> 1 _ { \mathcal { D } } </m> . but maybe there is more : in a recent discussion on this subject with alessandro valentino we came to conjecturing that , mimicing what happens between topological monoids and -LRB- pointed -RRB- topological spaces -LRB- see , e.g. http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4978 -RRB- , <m> \Omega </m> and <m> B </m> should be adjoint in a suitable sense . more precisely we expect one should have <m> F u n ^ { \otimes } ( B \mathcal { C } , \mathcal { D } ) \cong F u n ^ { \otimes } ( \mathcal { C } , \Omega \mathcal { D } ) </m> where <m> F u n ^ { \otimes } </m> stands for `` symmetric monoidal functors '' . but we have so far been unable to prove -LRB- or disprove -RRB- such a statement nor to locate it in the literature . any suggestion in either direction will be appreciated :-RRB-

given a non-negative integer <m> m </m> , let <m> \Omega _ m </m> denote the set of vectors <m> \omega = ( \omega _ 1 , \dots , \omega _ m ) \in [ 0 , 1 ] ^ m </m> such that <m> \sum _ i { \omega _ i } = 1 </m> . the set <m> \Omega _ m </m> is together with a metric <m> d _ M </m> , that is the manhattan distance between vectors , i.e. , <m> \forall \omega , \omega ' \in \Omega _ m </m> , <m> d _ M ( \omega , \omega ' ) = \sum _ i { | \omega _ i - \omega ' _ i | } </m> . given <m> S \subseteq \Omega _ m </m> , we denote <m> \min ( d _ M , S ) = \min _ { \omega , \omega ' \in S } { d _ M ( \omega , \omega ' ) } </m> . i am interested in the following `` most diverse <m> k </m> - subset '' problem : given two non-negative integers <m> m , k </m> , return a set <m> S \subset \Omega _ m </m> of size <m> k </m> that maximizes <m> \min ( d _ M , S ) </m> -LRB- i.e. , <m> S </m> is such that <m> \forall S ' \subset \Omega _ m </m> with <m> | S ' | = k </m> , we have <m> \min ( d _ M , S ' ) \leq \min ( d _ M , S ) </m> -RRB- . for example , if <m> m = 3 </m> and <m> k = 4 </m> , it seems that the only possible resulting set is <m> S = \{ ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) , ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 / 3 , 1 / 3 , 1 / 3 ) \} </m> , with <m> \min ( d _ M , S ) = 4 / 3 </m> . what would be the general algorithm to compute <m> S </m> , for all non-negative integers <m> m , k </m> ?
let <m> k </m> be a global field and let <m> S </m> be a non-empty set of places containing all archimedean ones . suppose <m> f : G \to H </m> is a surjective <m> k </m> - morphism of <m> k </m> - groups and let <m> \Gamma \leq G ( k ) </m> be an <m> S </m> - arithmetic subgroup . is <m> f ( \Gamma ) </m> an <m> S </m> - arithmetic subgroup ? if <m> k = \mathbb { Q } </m> and <m> \Gamma = G ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> this is theorem 4.1 in `` algebraic groups and number theory '' by platonov and rapinchuk . i assume that this can be extended to <m> k </m> any number field and <m> S </m> any finite set of places . what about the positive characteristic case ? is there a similar theory ? is this result still true ? what is an adequate reference for this topic when <m> k </m> is of positive characteristic ?
when i tested this in mathematica , i had expected it to say it did not converge . however , i got this : <m> \prod _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty n ^ { \mu ( n ) } = \frac { 1 } { 4 \pi ^ 2 } </m> note : this is the reciprocal of -LRB- 3 -RRB- zeta-regularized product over all primes . this indicates there is a slight skew toward the square-free numbers that have an odd number of factors . i have n't been able to find this in the literature , but my guess is that it is already known . can someone point me in the right direction ? edit : we have been told it is a bug . mathematica v. 10 does not produce a symbolic answer . edit 2 we can make this work by creating a function <m> f ( k ) </m> that returns the <m> k </m> - th square-free number -LRB- in the constructive ? order -RRB- . we can find a few ideas from a019565 . <m> \prod _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } f ( n ) ^ { \mu ( f ( n ) ) } </m> <m> \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \mu ( f ( n ) ) </m> at the steps when <m> n > 2 </m> is a power of <m> 2 </m> , sum <m> = 0 </m> and prod <m> = 1 </m> . also , at those steps , <m> f ( n ) </m> is the primorial with <m> p _ k </m> as the greatest factor , with <m> k = \frac { \log ( n ) } { \log ( 2 ) } </m> there is a revised question over here . it is a variation to edit 2 .
i felt that the earlier question may be too challenging , so let me provide a different angle and more infos to tackle an easier and separate problem . let us consider a more explicit a short exact sequence : <m> 1 \to S U ( n ) \to U ( n ) \to U ( 1 ) \to 1 , </m> where the normal subgroup <m> N = S U ( n ) </m> , <m> Q = U ( 1 ) </m> , and <m> G = U ( N ) </m> can be continuous lie groups in general -LRB- or finite groups -RRB- . we see that <m> { U } ( n ) </m> is related to <m> { S U } ( n ) </m> and <m> { U } ( 1 ) </m> by <m> { U } ( n ) = \frac { { U } ( 1 ) \times { S U } ( n ) } { \mathbb { Z } _ n } </m> where <m> { \mathbb { Z } _ n } = { \mathbb { Z } } / ( { n \mathbb { Z } } ) </m> , a finite abelian cyclic group of order <m> n </m> . this is the case because both <m> U ( 1 ) </m> and <m> { S U } ( n ) </m> shares the same subgroup <m> { \mathbb { Z } _ n } = \{ \exp ( \frac { 2 \pi i } { n } j ) \cdot \mathbb { I } _ { n \times n } \} </m> where <m> j \in \mathbb { Z } \mod n </m> . let us take <m> N \in </m> even integer , thus <m> { \mathbb { Z } _ n } \supset \{ 1 , - 1 \} = { \mathbb { Z } _ 2 } . </m>
i 've been thinking about grassmannians recently . think of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ k </m> as a <m> k </m> - dimensional vector space . let <m> \text { G r } _ n ( \mathbb { R } ^ k ) </m> denote the grassmannian of all <m> n </m> - dimensional vector subspaces of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ k . </m> -LRB- this is a compact , hausdorf topological manifold of dimension <m> n ( k - n ) </m> . -RRB- let <m> \Gamma ^ n ( \mathbb { R } ^ k ) : = \{ ( X , v ) : X \in \text { G r } _ n ( \mathbb { R } ^ k ) \text { a n d } v \in X \} . </m> there 's a standard idea of a vector bundle <m> \pi : \Gamma ^ n ( \mathbb { R } ^ k ) \twoheadrightarrow \text { G r } _ n ( \mathbb { R } ^ k ) </m> given by <m> \pi ( X , v ) : = X . </m> this bundle has the nice property that lots of other bundles can be realised as sub-bundles of it . there is a more general definition , where we use <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { \infty } </m> in place of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ k </m> . my question is about why we define <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { \infty } </m> the way we do . we define <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { \infty } </m> as the set of infinite sequences <m> ( x _ 1 , x _ 2 , x _ 3 , \ldots ) </m> where each <m> x _ i \in \mathbb { R } </m> and only finitely many of the <m> x _ i </m> are non-zero . we identify <m> \mathbb { R } ^ k </m> with the sequences of the form <m> ( x _ 1 , \ldots , x _ k , 0 , 0 , \ldots ) , </m> and then topologize <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { \infty } </m> as the direct limit of the sequence <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 1 \subset \mathbb { R } ^ 2 \subset \mathbb { R } ^ 3 \subset \ldots </m> then we get the universal bundle <m> \pi : \Gamma ^ n ( \mathbb { R } ^ { \infty } ) \twoheadrightarrow \text { G r } _ n ( \mathbb { R } ^ { \infty } ) . </m> my question is why do we insist that only finitely many of the <m> x _ i </m> are non-zero for each <m> ( x _ 1 , x _ 2 , x _ 3 , \ldots ) \in \mathbb { R } ^ { \infty } </m> ? i understand that it gives a countably infinite dimensional vector space , but that 's a result of the definition ; it does n't explain why we define it the way we do . i suspect that it 's related to the topology , but i do n't really know . edit : the context is the op is reading milnor and stasheff .
a grad student asked me this question during office hours , and i could n't for the life of me come up with a proof or counterexample : for a given <m> F : \mathbb { R } ^ 3 \to \mathbb { R } ^ 3 </m> , does <m> ( \nabla \times F ) \cdot F = ( \nabla \times F ) \cdot \nabla f </m> in <m> R ^ 3 </m> always have a solution in <m> f </m> ?

in general , frobenius splitting only defines on field of characteristic <m> p </m> -LRB- algebraically closed -RRB- field . i am reading brion and kumar 's book and i can see that there are geometric results can be proven by it on flag variety such as all higher cohomology groups of ample line bundle vanish , rational singularity , normality etc. . i am pretty curious about what kind of results over characteristic zero were/could be proven by frobenius splitting technique . can anyone give me some examples or reference about this aspect ?
what is the probability that three pairs <m> ( a , b ) </m> , <m> ( c , d ) </m> and <m> ( e , f ) </m> of integers generate <m> \mathbb Z ^ 2 </m> ? as usual the probability is the limit as <m> n \to \infty </m> of the same probability for the <m> n \times n </m> square . it is well known that for <m> \mathbb Z </m> the probability of two numbers to generate is <m> 6 / \pi ^ 2 </m> .
suppose <m> X </m> is a smooth proper curve over <m> \mathbb { F } _ p </m> for some prime number <m> p </m> . let <m> l \neq p </m> be a prime , and suppose <m> L </m> is a rank 2 local system over <m> X </m> with coefficients in <m> \mathbb { Z } _ l </m> such that <m> L </m> `` looks like '' it comes fro an elliptic curve . in paricular : 1 -RRB- <m> L </m> is of weight 1 . i.e. for any <m> \mathbb { F } _ { p ^ m } </m> point of <m> X </m> , the frobenius acting on <m> L </m> has eigenvalues that are weil numbers of absolute value <m> \sqrt { p ^ m } </m> , and 2 -RRB- <m> L </m> has coefficient field <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> . that is , the corresponding <m> \pi _ 1 ( X ) </m> representation has traces in <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> . <m> \textbf { Q u e s t i o n } </m> : does <m> L </m> come from the tate module of an elliptic curve over <m> X </m> ? <m> \textbf { T h i n g s I k n o w : } </m> i know that by work of l.lafforgue <m> L </m> is motivic , but i do n't know how to extract the above statement . also , it sees like drinfelds work on elliptic modules might allow you to find <m> L </m> in the jacobian of some modular curve , which would be enough . this would require <m> L </m> to be steinberg at one place - though i 'm not entirely sure what this means . in any case , i do n't quite understand the details well enough .
let <m> \Gamma ( \mathbb { Z } ) = \operatorname { S L } _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } ) \times \operatorname { S L } _ 3 ( \mathbb { Z } ) \times \operatorname { S L } _ 3 ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> . then <m> \Gamma </m> acts on a pair <m> ( A , B ) </m> of <m> 3 \times 3 </m> matrices via the following action : for <m>  </m> and <m> S , T \in \operatorname { S L } _ 3 ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> , we have that <m> ( U , S , T ) </m> acts on <m> ( A , B ) </m> by <m> \displaystyle ( U , S , T ) \cdot ( A , B ) = ( u _ 1 S A T ^ t + u _ 2 S B T ^ t , u _ 3 S A T ^ t + u _ 4 S B T ^ t ) </m> where <m> T ^ t </m> refers to the transpose of <m> T </m> . bhargava proved in his higher composition laws ii that the <m> \Gamma ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> - orbits of pairs of integral matrices <m> ( A , B ) </m> parametrize ideal classes of cubic orders . in particular , the associated cubic order is given by the -LRB- class of -RRB- binary cubic form <m> F </m> given as <m> F ( x , y ) = \det ( A x - B y ) . </m> an ideal class in a number field also has a norm form , which is always a decomposable form -LRB- i.e. , it splits into linear factors over an algebraically closed field -RRB- . thus there should be some way of converting the pair <m> ( A , B ) </m> into a ternary norm form . the obvious construction of taking a determinantal form , analogous to how <m> F </m> is defined , does n't seem to work as a determinantal form in three variables is in general not decomposable . how does one canonically give the norm form for the ideal class associated to <m> ( A , B ) </m> in terms of the coefficients of <m> ( A , B ) </m> ?
taylor shows that for a hilbert moduar form of parallel weight 2 , if we let <m> \rho </m> be the associated <m> \ell </m> - adic galois representation , then there is a <m> \ell </m> - divisible group <m> H </m> such <m> \rho | _ { G _ \lambda } </m> for <m> \lambda | \ell </m> is isomorphic to the <m> \ell </m> - adic tate module of <m> H </m> . what about the case for general weight ?
assume that <m> V </m> is a finite dimensional real vector space of dimension <m> n </m> . is there a <m> \mathbb { R } - </m> valued <m> k </m> - linear map <m> T </m> on <m> V </m> which is not an alternative form but it vanish on all <m> k </m> - tuple <m> ( x _ 1 , x _ 2 , \ldots , x _ k ) </m> with <m> \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ k x _ i = 0 </m> ?
let <m> X \rightarrow S </m> be an arithmetic surface -LRB- this means , in the language of qing liu 's book , <m> X </m> is a regular integral scheme of dimension 2 , projective and flat over a dedekind scheme <m> S </m> of dimension 1 -RRB- . let <m> \eta </m> be the generic point of <m> S </m> . let <m> \omega _ { X / S } </m> be the dualizing sheaf of <m> X / S </m> , which is invertible , hence there is a cartier divisor <m> K _ { X / S } </m> such that <m> \omega _ { X / S } \cong \mathcal { O } _ X ( K _ { X / S } ) </m> . at first , it seemed natural to me that since <m> \omega _ { X / S } </m> is a `` relative object '' , <m> K _ { X / S } </m> should be linearly equivalent to a purely horizontal effective divisor - ie , is a nonnegative linear combination of horizontal prime divisors . however , this can not always be the case , since if <m> X _ \eta </m> is genus <m> \ge 1 </m> , then <m> K _ { X / S } </m> can be chosen to be effective , and if <m> X </m> is not minimal -LRB- ie , contains an exceptional -LRB- vertical -RRB- divisor <m> E </m> -RRB- , then <m> K _ { X / S } \cdot E < 0 </m> , which can only happen if <m> E </m> is a component of <m> K _ { X / S } </m> -LRB- for any effective canonical divisor <m> K _ { X / S } </m> -RRB- . thus , the question is : if <m> X _ \eta </m> is say smooth of genus <m> \ge 1 </m> -LRB- or <m> \ge 2 </m> if <m> g = 1 </m> is special -RRB- , and <m> X </m> is minimal , then can we always find an effective canonical divisor <m> K _ { X / S } </m> which is a linear combination of horizontal prime divisors ? is there any intuition for why this is/isn ` t/should/shouldn ' t be the case ?
consider the compactified modular curve <m> X _ 0 ( p ^ 2 ) </m> and the corresponding algebraic curve over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> . my questions are the following :
i would like to know if there are infinitely many <m> k </m> for which <m> \sigma ( k ) / k = n ^ p </m> such that <m> m = k { n } ^ { p - 1 } </m> with <m> m , n > 0 </m> and <m> p </m> is an odd prime ? note : <m> \sigma ( \frac { m } { { n } ^ { p - 1 } } ) </m> is the sum of divisors function of <m> \frac { m } { { n } ^ { p - 1 } } </m> such that <m> m = k { n } ^ { p - 1 } </m> . edit 2 : i edited the question as it has the same meaning for the precedent . thank you for any help .
given a finite group <m> G </m> , a finite cyclic group <m> A </m> -LRB- viewed as a subgroup of <m> \mathbb { C } ^ { \times } </m> , i.e. generated by a <m> | A | </m> - th root of unity -RRB- , and a 2-cocycle <m> \alpha \in Z ^ { 2 } ( G , A ) </m> . recall that an <m> \alpha </m> - projective representation of <m> G </m> is a map <m> \rho : G \to G L ( V ) </m> such that <m> \rho ( g ) \rho ( h ) = \alpha ( g , h ) \rho ( g h ) </m> for all <m> g , h \in G </m> .
shahn majin and xavier gomez say in the beginig of their article -LRB- noncommutative cohomology and electromagnetism on <m> \mathbb { C } _ q [ S L _ 2 ] </m> at roots of unity -RRB- that tha action of left <m> \mathbb { C } _ q [ S L _ 2 ] </m> - crossed modules is given by : <m> \nonumber a \triangleright \left ( \begin {array} { c c } e _ a & e _ b \\ e _ c & e _ d \\ \end {array} \right ) = \left ( \begin {array} { c c } q e _ a + q \mu ^ 2 e _ d & e _ b \\ e _ c & q ^ { - 1 } e _ d \\ \end {array} \right ) </m> <m> \nonumber b \triangleright \left ( \begin {array} { c c } e _ a & e _ b \\ e _ c & e _ d \\ \end {array} \right ) = \left ( \begin {array} { c c } \mu e _ c & \mu e _ d \\ 0 & 0 \\ \end {array} \right ) </m> <m> \nonumber c \triangleright \left ( \begin {array} { c c } e _ a & e _ b \\ e _ c & e _ d \\ \end {array} \right ) = \left ( \begin {array} { c c } \mu e _ b & 0 \\ q \mu e _ d & 0 \\ \end {array} \right ) </m> <m> \nonumber d \triangleright \left ( \begin {array} { c c } e _ a & e _ b \\ e _ c & e _ d \\ \end {array} \right ) = \left ( \begin {array} { c c } q ^ { - 1 } e _ a & e _ b \\ e _ c & q e _ d \\ \end {array} \right ) </m> my question is how -LRB- or where -RRB- can we find the details of this result ? thank you
let <m> \mathbb F _ q </m> be a finite field -LRB- where <m> q </m> is in general a power of a prime -RRB- , and let <m> e , k </m> be positive integers with <m> k \leq e < q - 1 </m> . let <m> f _ 0 ( x ) , \ldots , f _ k ( x ) \in \mathbb F _ q [ x ] </m> be polynomials such that <m> e = \deg f _ 0 > \deg f _ 1 > \cdots > \deg f _ k , </m> and let us define <m> W : = \langle f _ 0 , f _ 1 , \ldots , f _ k \rangle </m> the subspace of dimension <m> k + 1 </m> of <m> \mathbb F _ q [ x ] _ { \leq e } </m> seen as vector space over <m> \mathbb F _ q </m> . furthermore let <m> T _ e </m> be the set defined by <m> T _ e : = \left \{ p ( x ) \in \mathbb F _ q [ x ] \; | \; \deg p = e \; , l c ( p ) = 1 , \; p ( x ) | x ^ { q - 1 } - 1 \right \} . </m> i 'd like to find <m> M _ { e , k , q } : = \max | W \cap T _ e | , </m> where the maximum is over all the subspaces of the form described above . three simple cases are : when <m> e = k </m> then <m> M _ { e , e , q } = \binom { q - 1 } { e } </m> . when <m> e = q - 2 </m> then <m> M _ { q - 2 , k , q } = k + 1 </m> . when <m> k = 1 </m> then <m> M _ { e , 1 , q } = q - e </m> . when <m> k = 0 </m> then <m> M _ { e , 0 , q } = 1 </m> . maybe it could be useful the fact that , for <m> e < q - 1 </m> , <m> T _ e </m> is a set of generators of <m> \mathbb F _ q [ x ] _ { \leq e } </m> . i think it 's a quite difficult question , but i 'd just like to know some non-obvious bounds on <m> | W \cap T _ e | </m> . edit : of course <m> M _ { e , k , q } \geq \dbinom { q - 1 - e + k } { k } </m> . let us take <m> f _ k ( x ) = \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ { e - k } ( x - \alpha _ i ) , </m> where <m> \alpha _ i \in \mathbb F _ q ^ * </m> for every <m> i = 1 , \ldots , e - k </m> and <m> \alpha _ i \neq \alpha _ j </m> for every <m> i \neq j </m> . moreover let us take , for <m> j = 0 , \ldots , k - 1 </m> , <m> f _ j ( x ) = x ^ { k - j } f _ k ( x ) . </m> then <m> W : = \langle f _ 0 , \ldots , f _ k \rangle </m> has exactly <m> \dbinom { q - 1 - e + k } { k } </m> elements of <m> T _ e </m> . i suppose that <m> M _ { e , k , q } </m> is exactly <m> \dbinom { q - 1 - e + k } { k } </m> . in fact in the three cases described above it seems to work . could anyone help me to prove it ? thanks .

i read that the unit hypersphere has maximum volume for dimension five and would like to generalize this result . -LRB- if you think that integrating over an <m> n </m> - dimensional <m> p </m> - hyper-ellipsoid area -LRB- <m> x _ 1 ^ p + x _ 2 ^ p + . . . + x _ n ^ p = 1 </m> -RRB- is too trivial for mathoverflow , delete . -RRB- mathematica gave the complicated result : <m> \frac { \Gamma ( 1 + p ^ { - 1 } ) ^ 2 } { \Gamma ( ( 2 + p ) / p ) } + { } _ 2 F _ 1 ( - p ^ { - 1 } , p ^ { - 1 } , 1 + p ^ { - 1 } , { ( - 1 ) } ^ p ) </m> which could be wrong by a factor 2 . thus even for <m> n = 2 </m> the gaussian integrals show the result is not elementary .

for a fixed natural number <m> n </m> is it possible to obtain an asymptotic for the number of solutions <m> ( a , x , b , y ) \in \mathbb { N ^ 4 } </m> to <m> a x + b y = n </m> or equivalently an asymptotic for <m> \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { n - 1 } d ( k ) d ( n - k ) </m> ? using some heuristics i got that possibly : <m> \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { n - 1 } d ( k ) d ( n - k ) \sim \frac { 3 } { \pi ^ 2 } \sigma ( n ) \ln ( n ) ^ 2 </m> i wrote : <m> \sum \limits _ { k = 1 } ^ { n - 1 } d ( k ) d ( n - k ) = \sum \limits _ { { ( a , x , b , y ) \in \mathbb { N ^ 4 } } \atop { a x + b y = n } } 1 = \sum \limits _ { d \mid n } \sum \limits _ { { ( a , x , b , y ) \in \mathbb { N ^ 4 } } \atop { ( a , b ) = d , a x + b y = n } } 1 = \sum \limits _ { d \mid n } \sum _ { { ( a , x , b , y ) \in \mathbb { N ^ 4 } } \atop ( a , b ) = 1 , { a x + b y = \frac { n } { d } } } 1 </m> <m> = \sum \limits _ { d \mid n } \sum \limits _ { { ( a , b ) \in \mathbb { N ^ 2 } } \atop { ( a , b ) = 1 } } \sum \limits _ { { ( x , y ) \in \mathbb { N ^ 2 } } \atop { a x + b y = \frac { n } { d } } } 1 </m> now i considered a fixed natural number <m> m </m> and looked at the solutions <m> ( x , y ) </m> to <m> a x + b y = m </m> then noted that <m> x \leq \frac { m - b } { a } </m> and that the solutions <m> x </m> would be of the form : <m> x \equiv c + a , c + 2 b , c + 3 b , c + 4 b , . . . c + k b </m> , so i wrote <m> c + k b \leq \frac { m - b } { a } \implies k \leq \frac { m - b } { a b } - \frac { c } { b } </m> so the largest such <m> k </m> that should satisfy this is <m> \lfloor { \frac { m - b } { a b } - \frac { c } { a } } \rfloor \approx \lfloor { \frac { m } { a b } } \rfloor </m> then went back and wrote : <m> \sum \limits _ { k = 1 } ^ { n - 1 } d ( k ) d ( n - k ) \approx \sum \limits _ { d \mid n } \sum \limits _ { { ( a , b ) \in \mathbb { N ^ 2 } } \atop ( a , b ) = 1 } \lfloor { \frac { n / d } { a b } } \rfloor \approx \sum \limits _ { d \mid n } \frac { n } { d } \sum \limits _ { { a b \leq n , ( a , b ) = 1 } \atop ( a , b ) \in \mathbb { N ^ 2 } } \frac { 1 } { a b } </m> <m> = \sigma ( n ) \sum \limits _ { a b \leq n \atop ( a , b ) = 1 } \frac { 1 } { a b } = \sigma ( n ) \sum \limits _ { k \leq \sqrt { n } } \frac { \mu ( k ) } { k ^ 2 } \sum \limits _ { a b \leq \frac { n } { k ^ 2 } } \frac { 1 } { a b } = \sigma ( n ) \sum \limits _ { k \leq \sqrt { n } } \frac { \mu ( k ) } { k ^ 2 } \sum \limits _ { j \leq \frac { n } { k ^ 2 } } \frac { d ( j ) } { j } </m> <m> \approx \sigma ( n ) \sum \limits _ { k \leq \sqrt { n } } \frac { \mu ( k ) } { k ^ 2 } \frac { \ln ( n / k ^ 2 ) ^ 2 } { 2 } \sim \frac { \sigma ( n ) \ln ( n ) ^ 2 } { 2 } \sum _ { k \ge 1 } \frac { \mu ( k ) } { k ^ 2 } = \frac { 3 } { \pi ^ 2 } \sigma ( n ) \ln ( n ) ^ 2 </m> but this does n't seem right either because i know that , <m> \sum _ { a x + b y \leq m \atop ( a , x , b , y ) \in \mathbb { N ^ 4 } } 1 = \frac { m ^ 2 \ln ( m ) ^ 2 } { 2 } + ( 2 \gamma - \frac { 3 } { 2 } ) m ^ 2 \ln ( m ) + ( 2 \gamma ^ 2 - \frac { 5 } { 2 } \gamma - \frac { \pi ^ 2 } { 1 2 } + \frac { 3 } { 2 } ) m ^ 2 + O ( m ^ { 1 + \theta } \ln ( m ) ) </m> where <m> \theta </m> is the same <m> \theta </m> in dirichlet 's divisor problem . thus i would expect that if <m> \sum \limits _ { k = 1 } ^ { n - 1 } d ( k ) d ( n - k ) \sim C ' \sigma ( n ) \ln ( n ) ^ 2 </m> for some constant <m> C ' </m> that we would then have that <m> C ' = \frac { 6 } { \pi ^ 2 } </m> , which it is n't according to the last heuristic . so i 'm not really sure how to proceed , and would really appreciate any help in finding an asymptotic expansion for <m> \sum \limits _ { k = 1 } ^ { n - 1 } d ( k ) d ( n - k ) </m> .

with a little bit of work , one can show that <m> \mathbb { C P } ^ n </m> and <m> \mathbb { R P } ^ n \times \mathbb { R P } ^ n </m> have the same stiefel-whitney numbers , so by a theorem of thom , they are -LRB- unorientedly -RRB- cobordant .

does the 6-element group <m> S _ 3 </m> have a finite -LRB- balanced -RRB- semigroup presentation of the form <m> \langle a _ 1 , . . . , a _ n \mid a _ 1 = u _ 1 , a _ 2 = u _ 2 , . . . , a _ n = u _ n \rangle </m> where <m> u _ 1 , u _ 2 , . . . , u _ n </m> are semigroup words ? let us call such a semigroup presentation -LCB- \ it tree-like -RCB- . edit : by a semigroup word , i mean a word without inverses of letters . by a semigroup presentation , i mean a presentation in the class of semigroups -LRB- not groups -RRB- . for example , <m> \langle a , b \mid a ^ 3 = a , b = a b ^ 2 a \rangle </m> defines <m> S _ 3 </m> in the class of groups but a `` bigger '' semigroup in the class of semigroups . in that semigroup , <m> b </m> does not divide <m> a </m> , so it is not a group . motivation 1 . the cyclic group of order <m> n </m> has a tree-like semigroup presentation <m> \langle a \mid a = a ^ { n + 1 } \rangle </m> . matt brin noted that the 8-element quaternion group has the tree-like presentation <m> \langle a , b , c \mid a = b c , b = c a , c = a b \rangle </m> . the groups <m> S _ m , m > 3 </m> do not have tree-like presentations because they do not even have balanced -LRB- same number of relations and generators -RRB- presentations at all since their schur multipliers are non-trivial . the group <m> S _ 3 </m> has a balanced presentation . motivation 2 . every tree-like semigroup presentation corresponds to a -LRB- closed -RRB- subgroup of the r. thompson group <m> F </m> . for example as shown by guba the brin tree-like presentation of the quaternion group corresponds to a copy of the thompson group <m> F _ 9 </m> -LRB- the group of piecewise linear homeomorphisms of <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> with slopes of the form <m> 9 ^ k </m> and break points of the derivative from <m> \mathbb { Z } [ 1 / 9 ] </m> -RRB- .
suppose that <m> \Delta f \in L ^ 1 ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) </m> , where <m> \Delta </m> denotes the laplacian . then i 'm asking whether or not we have the following estimates <m> \| \nabla | f | ^ { \frac 1 2 } \| _ { L ^ 2 } \leq C \| \Delta f \| _ { L ^ 1 } ^ { \frac 1 2 } . </m> i.e. , does the mapping <m> f \to | f | ^ { \frac 1 2 } </m> send functions from <m> \dot { W ^ { 2 , 1 } } </m> to <m> \dot { W ^ { 1 , 2 } } </m> ? it seems that a paper of w. sickel -LRB- boundedness properties of the mapping <m> f \to | f | ^ { \mu } </m> , <m> 0 < \mu < 1 </m> in the framework of besov spaces -RRB- has shown that the inhomogeneous version of the inequality above is indeed true . however i 'm not able to get that paper for now , and more importantly , i 'm not sure whether the method there will also work for the case i 'm concerning . any comment is welcome .
let <m> G </m> be a locally compact group , let <m> N </m> be a closed normal subgroup of <m> G </m> , and let <m> \sigma \colon G / N \to G </m> be a cross section . let us define <m> \alpha \colon G / N \times G / N \to N </m> by the formula <m> \sigma ( x ) \sigma ( y ) \alpha ( x , y ) = \sigma ( x y ) , </m> for all <m> x , y \in G / N </m> . then <m> \alpha </m> records how far <m> \sigma </m> is from being multiplicative . is there a standard name for <m> \alpha </m> ? it seems to be a variant of a <m> 2 </m> - cocycle , but it is not the usual <m> 2 </m> - cocylce associated to a cross section .
let <m> C </m> be a smooth projective curve over some field <m> k </m> and <m> x </m> a closed point of <m> C </m> . i 've seen some constructions in which people use <m> k ( C ) ^ \times / 1 + \mathfrak { m } _ x </m> . what 's the meaning of that ? i know that here <m> k ( C ) </m> is the function field of the curve and i guess that <m> \mathfrak { m } _ x </m> is the maximal ideal of the local ring <m> \mathcal { O } _ { C , x } </m> . so what does it mean that two regular functions on the curve have the same class modulo <m> 1 + \mathfrak { m } _ x </m> ? thanks for your help
so much is known about hermitian and non-hermitian idempotents in a <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra , that someone must have written down the following .
i 'm have some difficulties in bounding the following inequality : i want to find a c as small as possible s.t. <m> \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n x _ i ^ 4 \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n x _ i ^ 2 - \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n x _ i ^ 6 \leq c \left ( \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n x _ i ^ 3 \right ) ^ 2 </m> where <m> x _ i </m> are all non-negative i know from the cauchy-inequality that <m> \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n x _ i ^ 4 \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n x _ i ^ 2 \geq \left ( \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n x _ i ^ 3 \right ) ^ 2 </m> but i think it useless in my question . . and more generally for some k and l , find out a small c s.t. <m> \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n x _ i ^ { 2 k - l } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n x _ i ^ l - \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n x _ i ^ { 2 k } \leq c \left ( \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n x _ i ^ k \right ) ^ 2 </m> anyone help with out ? thanks !!
this question is kind of suggested by the question is the category of group objects in an <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - topos reflective as a subcategory of the groupoid objects ? question : if <m> \mathcal C </m> in an <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> topos , is the functor from groupoid objects internal to <m> \mathcal C </m> to <m> \mathcal C </m> given by the objects in some sense both a fibration and a cofibration ? i expect for the latter one needs some kind of natural number object . in the case of sets , the cofibration property gives for a groupoid <m> G </m> and a function <m> f : O b ( G ) \to Y </m> a new groupoid say <m> f _ * ( G ) </m> with object set <m> Y </m> and the appropriate universal property : see higgins ' book categories and groupoids . the topological application is the effect on the fundamental groupoid <m> \pi _ 1 ( X , X _ 0 ) </m> of vertex identifications of a cw-complex <m> X </m> . in particular , if <m> Y </m> is a singleton , we get a group from a groupoid . one can make this construction include free groups and free products of groups .
let <m> G </m> be a connected reductive group defined over a field <m> F </m> . let <m> T </m> be a maximal torus of <m> G </m> which is defined over <m> F </m> , <m> A _ 0 </m> the maximal <m> F </m> - split subtorus of <m> T </m> , and <m> X _ 0 </m> the cotorsion free subgroup of <m> X = X ( T ) </m> corresponding to <m> A _ 0 </m> . if <m> L </m> is a finite galois extension of <m> F </m> over which <m> T </m> splits , then <m> X _ 0 </m> can be described as <m> X _ 0 = \{ \chi \in X : \sum \limits _ { \sigma \in \textrm { G a l } ( L / F ) } \chi ^ { \sigma } = 0 \} </m> now , let <m> \Phi </m> be the set of roots of <m> T </m> in <m> G </m> , and <m> \Delta </m> a base for the root system <m> ( \langle \Phi \rangle _ { \mathbb { Q } } , \Phi ) </m> , where <m> \langle \Phi \rangle _ { \mathbb { Q } } </m> denotes the vector subspace of <m> \mathbb { Q } \otimes _ { \mathbb { Z } } X </m> spanned by <m> \Phi </m> . the base <m> \Delta </m> comes from a total ordering <m> < </m> of <m> \langle \Phi \rangle _ { \mathbb { Q } } </m> , or even of <m> X </m> . suppose that <m> < </m> is compatible with <m> X _ 0 </m> in the sense that if <m> \chi , \chi ' \in X </m> with <m> \chi + X _ 0 = \chi ' + X _ 0 </m> with <m> \chi \not \in X _ 0 </m> and positive , then <m> \chi ' </m> is also positive . then <m> < </m> induces a total ordering on <m> X / X _ 0 </m> . suppose <m> \Delta </m> is coming from such a total ordering . let <m> \overline { \Delta } </m> be the image of <m> \Delta </m> in <m> X / X _ 0 </m> , if necessary removing the zero element . it may not be the case that the reduction of <m> \Delta - \Delta \cap X _ 0 </m> modulo <m> X _ 0 </m> is injective . nevertheless , let <m> \overline { \Delta } = \{ \gamma _ 1 , . . . , \gamma _ t \} </m> for distinct <m> \gamma _ i \in X / X _ 0 </m> . these are positive elements in the total ordering on <m> X / X _ 0 </m> . is it the case that the <m> \gamma _ i </m> are linearly independent ? i have tried to prove this without success . i was thinking that <m> \overline { \Delta } </m> should be a base for a possibly nonreduced root system . the elements of the image of <m> \Phi </m> in <m> X / X _ 0 </m> , removing zero , are integer-linear combinations of <m> \overline { \Delta } </m> which are either all positive or all negative , but the linear independence does not seem obvious .

this is in continuation with this geometric/analytic techniques for constructive and asymptotic bounds in the lee metric codes over alphabet <m> \mathbb { Z } _ { q } </m> of length <m> n </m> for the lee metric seems to be connected to spaced points on the <m> n </m> - torus since both seem to have some circular nature over each dimension . are there any references which talks about their connection rigorously ? from wiki : in coding theory , the `` lee distance '' is a distance between two strings <m> x _ { 1 } x _ { 2 } \dots x _ { n } </m> and <m> y _ { 1 } y _ { 2 } \dots y _ { n } </m> of equal length <m> n </m> over the <m> q </m> - ary alphabet <m> \{ 0 , 1 , \cdots , q - 1 \} </m> of size <m> q \ge 2 </m> . it is a metric , defined as <m> \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n \min ( | x _ i - y _ i | , q - | x _ i - y _ i | ) </m> if <m> q = 2 </m> or <m> 3 </m> , the lee distance coincides with the hamming distance . the metric space induced by the lee distance is a discrete analog of the elliptic geometry | elliptic space .

if i understood my automorphic forms correctly , at least cusp forms can be thought of as elements of <m> L ^ 2 ( G / \Gamma ) </m> for a <m> G = \text { S L } _ 2 ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> and <m> \Gamma = \text { S L } _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> or a suitable congrence subgroup . i want to know if there is an analogous result for hyperbolic-3 space modulo a bianchi group . for example : <m> \mathbb { H } ^ 3 \, / \, \text { P S L } _ 2 \big ( \mathbb { Z } [ i ] \big ) </m> this is a group action by isometries . they inherit from this action of the full group : <m>  </m> in this case , is there a version of modular forms -LRB- or cusp forms -RRB- here ? i have never seen a discussion of modular forms over quaternionic arguments . i suppose the method of images could produce an invariant function : <m> f ( z ) = \sum _ { \gamma \in \text { P S L } _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } [ i ] ) } f _ 0 ( \gamma \, z ) </m> i am hoping or something more explicit . is there an analog of theta function or newform in this setting ? my guess this should be an element of the space <m> L ^ 2 ( G / \Gamma ) </m> that i have constructed . <m> f _ 0 ( a + b i + c j + d k ) = e ^ { 2 \pi i \, ( a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 + c ^ 2 + d ^ 2 ) } = q ^ { z \overline { z } } </m> this is just a speculation . certainly this will be invariant but it wo n't be in <m> L ^ 2 </m> .

please pardon my ignorance on the subject of open books , i 'm a noob . i would like to know some explicit descriptions of open book decompositions of the three torus <m> T ^ 3 </m> . are there examples with connected binding ? is there a direct topological proof that shows that every 3-manifold admits an open book decomposition ? ideally , such a proof might start with a heegaard decomposition or a surgery description of a given 3-manifold , and then proceed to give an algorithm for converting this to an open book decomposition . in such a case , i suppose i could then follow such a proof to answer my first question regarding <m> T ^ 3 </m> .
the situation is similar to this question let <m> D </m> be a reduced projective scheme over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> whose associated analytic space <m> D _ { a n } </m> is simply connected as a topological space i.e. <m> \pi _ 1 ( D _ { a n } ) = 1 </m> . let <m> \Omega ^ 1 _ D </m> be its k \ '' -LCB- a -RCB- hler differential sheaf and <m> \hat { \Omega } _ D ^ 1 </m> be its double dual . question is <m> H ^ 0 ( D , \hat { \Omega } _ D ^ 1 ) = 0 </m> ? is there some counterexample ? i 'm considering how to deduce the above statement from the fact <m> \mathbb { H } ^ 0 ( D , \underline { \Omega } _ D ^ 1 ) = 0 </m> where <m> \underline { \Omega } _ D ^ 1 </m> is the graded piece of the du bois complex <m> \underline { \Omega } _ D ^ { \bullet } </m> . but i do n't know the way up to now .

recently i stumbled on the problem quoted here about a geometric proof of the am-gm inequality <m> ( a _ 1 + \cdots + a _ n ) ^ n \ge n ^ n a _ 1 \cdots a _ n </m> by packing <m> n ^ n </m> rectangular <m> n </m> - dimensional boxes of sides <m> a _ 1 , \dots , a _ n </m> into a hypercube of side <m> a _ 1 + \dots + a _ n </m> . for <m> n = 2 </m> this is almost trivial <m> - </m> just leave a square of side <m> | a _ 2 - a _ 1 | </m> in the middle and pack four <m> a _ 1 \times a _ 2 </m> rectangles around it . but already for <m> n = 3 </m> it is highly non trivial , and the quoted article shows in several ways graphically a packing of 27 <m> a \times b \times c </m> blocks into a cube of side <m> a + b + c </m> . presumably this packing was found by a program using trial and error , and it has hardly any symmetries . there should be many non isomorphic packings like this , and i am wondering :

let <m> ( E , d ) </m> be a bounded polish space -LRB- separable , complete metric space satisfying <m> \sup _ { x , y \in E } d ( x , y ) < \infty </m> -RRB- . by <m> \mathcal { P } ( E ) </m> we denote the space of borel probability measures on <m> E </m> endowed with the topology of weak convergence . we fix <m> \varepsilon > 0 </m> , <m> \theta \in \mathcal { P } ( E ) </m> and a stochastic kernel <m> \pi </m> on <m> E </m> -LRB- i.e. <m> \pi : E \times B o r ( E ) \rightarrow [ 0 , 1 ] </m> such that <m> \pi ( x , \cdot ) </m> is a borel measure for all <m> x \in E </m> and <m> \pi ( \cdot , A ) </m> is measurable for all borel sets <m> A \subseteq E </m> -RRB- . we assume that <m> \pi </m> satisfies the strong feller property , i.e. <m> x _ n \rightarrow x \in E \Rightarrow \pi ( x _ n , \cdot ) \stackrel { w } { \rightarrow } \pi ( x , \cdot ) </m> , where <m> \stackrel { w } { \rightarrow } </m> denotes weak convergence . we define <m>  </m> where <m> W _ 1 </m> is the first wasserstein distance on <m> \mathcal { P } ( E ) </m> given by <m>  </m> and <m> \Pi ( \nu , \mu ) </m> is the set of measures on <m> E ^ 2 </m> with first marginal <m> \nu </m> and second marginal <m> \mu </m> . question : is m closed ? remarks : by boundedness of <m> ( E , d ) </m> weak convergence is compatible with the wasserstein distance , i.e. <m> \mu _ n \stackrel { w } { \rightarrow } \mu \in \mathcal { P } ( E ) \Leftrightarrow W _ 1 ( \mu _ n , \mu ) \rightarrow 0 </m> . if <m> \pi </m> does not satisfy the strong feller property , <m> M </m> is in general not closed . take for example <m> \varepsilon = 0 . 5 , E = [ 0 , 1 ] , \theta = \delta _ 0 , \pi ( 0 , \cdot ) = \delta _ 1 </m> and <m> \pi ( x , \cdot ) = \delta _ 0 </m> for <m> x \neq 0 </m> . then <m> M \ni \delta _ { 1 / n } \otimes \delta _ 0 \stackrel { w } { \rightarrow } \delta _ 0 \otimes \delta _ 0 \not \in M </m> . even if <m> \pi </m> is constant , i do n't know whether <m> M </m> is closed and would be very interested in an answer for this case as well .
i am trying to understand -LRB- saito 's ? -RRB- category of mixed hodge modules as a category -LRB- i.e. i am not interested in its construction , just in properties of objects and morphisms -RRB- . i would be grateful for any nice references for this -LRB- though i have some texts already -RRB- ; yet currently i am interested in the following question . for algebraic varieties over a subfield <m> k </m> of the field of complex numbers , can one define certain mixed hodge modules with some <m> k </m> - structure that would be related with the <m> k </m> - structure on the de rham cohomology of <m> k </m> - varieties ? please tell me also if such a structure could be obtained from the usual ` complex ' hodge modules , or if the presence of a <m> k </m> - structure ` does not affect morphisms significantly ' .
suppose <m> L \subset K </m> are number fields and let 's choose and fix an algebraic closure <m> \overline { L } </m> of <m> L </m> such that <m> L \subset K \subset \overline { L } </m> , hence <m> H : = \text { G a l } ( \overline { L } / K ) </m> is a closed subgroup of <m> G : = \text { G a l } ( \overline { L } / L ) </m> of finite index <m> [ K , L ] </m> . suppose now we have an <m> \ell </m> - adic representation <m> V </m> of <m> \text { G a l } ( \overline { L } / K ) </m> , then there will exist an induced representation <m> \text { I n d } _ H ^ G \, V </m> of <m> \text { G a l } ( \overline { L } / L ) </m> . if necessary we could assume <m> V </m> has a geometric origin , e.g. it is the etale cohomology of a smooth variety defined over <m> K </m> . for a finite prime <m> \mathfrak { P } </m> of <m> K </m> , the local <m> L </m> - factor is defined as <m> L _ { \mathfrak { P } } ( V , s ) : = \text { d e t } ( 1 - \text { F r } _ { \mathfrak { P } } ( N ( \mathfrak { P } ) ) ^ { - s } \big | V ^ { I _ { \mathfrak { P } } } ) </m> where <m> I _ { \mathfrak { P } } </m> is the inertia group at <m> \mathfrak { P } </m> . similarly we could define the local <m> L </m> - factor for a prime <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> of <m> L </m> . question if <m> V </m> is an artin representation , we have <m> L _ { \mathfrak { p } } ( \text { I n d } _ H ^ G \, V , s ) = \prod _ { \mathfrak { P } | \mathfrak { p } } L _ { \mathfrak { P } } ( V , s ) </m> i guess it is still true for <m> \ell </m> - adic representations , but i do n't know how to prove . the method to prove this formula might still work , since the galois groups <m> H </m> and <m> G </m> are locally compact , but i am not sure as i know basically nothing about representation theories of locally compact groups . it would be great if someone could give a complete proof .
i 'm looking for a text i could cite that explicitly states the following result : for <m> \chi ^ \lambda </m> the irreducible character of the symmetric group indexed by the partition <m> \lambda </m> , and for <m> \sigma \in \mathfrak { S } _ n </m> and <m> \lambda \vdash n </m> , <m> \chi ^ { \lambda ' } ( \sigma ) = ( - 1 ) ^ { n - \ell ( \sigma ) } \chi ^ \lambda ( \sigma ) , </m> where <m> \lambda ' </m> is the dual partition , and <m> \ell ( \sigma ) </m> is the length of the cycle type partition associated to <m> \sigma </m> . it is not a hard result to prove -LRB- a simple combinatorial method , for instance , is to invoke the <m> \omega </m> involution from chapter 7 of stanley 's enumerative combinatorics -RRB- . what i 'm hoping for is a text that states this result directly -LRB- even if as an exercise -RRB- that could be cited without introducing background material and breaking the flow of a paper whose main topic is somewhat different from combinatorial representation theory .
let <m> p </m> be a prime number , <m> K / \mathbf { Q } _ p </m> a finite extension , with integers <m> O _ K </m> , valuation ideal <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> , and residue field <m> k _ \mathfrak { p } </m> . let <m> E </m> be an elliptic curve over <m> K </m> with good reduction <m> E _ \mathfrak { p } </m> over <m> k _ \mathfrak { p } </m> . if <m> \ell </m> is a prime <m> \neq p </m> , then <m> T _ \ell ( E ) </m> is identified with <m> T _ \ell ( E _ \mathfrak { p } ) </m> in a natural way , by the good reduction of <m> E </m> . as it turns out such a galois representation is determined , up to isomorphism , by the characteristic polynomial <m> f _ { E _ \mathfrak { p } } ( x ) = x ^ 2 - a _ { E _ \mathfrak { p } } x + | k _ \mathfrak { p } | </m> associated to <m> E _ \mathfrak { p } </m> and by <m> j _ E </m> mod <m> \mathfrak { p } = j _ { E _ \mathfrak { p } } </m> unless we are in the following -LRB- very -RRB- <m> { \it s p e c i a l } </m> case : <m> p \equiv 3 </m> mod <m> 4 </m> ; <m> | k _ \mathfrak { p } | = p ^ { 2 m + 1 } </m> ; <m> a _ { E _ \mathfrak { p } } = 0 </m> ; <m> \ell = 2 </m> ; and <m> j _ E \equiv 1 7 2 8 </m> mod <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> . if the first three conditions hold , then <m> E _ \mathfrak { p } </m> is supersingular and its endomorphisms ring over <m> k _ \mathfrak { p } </m> is `` only '' isomorphic to an order in <m> \mathbf { Q } ( \sqrt { - p } ) </m> containing <m> \sqrt { - p } </m> , and thus isomorphic to either <m> \mathbf { Z } [ \sqrt { - p } ] </m> or to <m> \mathbf { Z } [ ( 1 + \sqrt { - p } ) / 2 ] </m> . the second case occurs precisely when all the two torsion is defined over <m> k _ \mathfrak { p } </m> , the first case when <m> E _ \mathfrak { p } [ 2 ] </m> has only two <m> k _ \mathfrak { p } </m> - points . both cases do arise and give rise to non-isomorphic <m> T _ 2 ( E _ \mathfrak { p } ) </m> . essentially by deuring 's lifting lemma one can decide which of the two possibilities occurs by looking at the <m> j </m> - invariant of <m> E _ \mathfrak { p } </m> unless this is equal to 1728 . the point is that if <m> j _ { E _ \mathfrak { p } } \neq 1 7 2 8 </m> then the two <m> k _ \mathfrak { p } </m> - forms of <m> E _ \mathfrak { p } \otimes _ { k _ \mathfrak { p } } \bar k _ \mathfrak { p } </m> lying in the <m> k _ \mathfrak { p } </m> - isogeny class <m> a _ { E _ \mathfrak { p } } = 0 </m> have the same ring of endomorphisms over <m> k _ \mathfrak { p } </m> , out of the two possibilities listed above . the opposite being true when <m> j _ { E _ \mathfrak { p } } = 1 7 2 8 </m> -LRB- this fact is very related to the analysis of the mod <m> p </m> reduction of hilbert class polynomials associated to discriminants <m> - p </m> and <m> - 4 p </m> done by gross and elkies -LRB- cf. <m> \S 2 </m> , proposition , in elkies ' `` the existence of infinitely many supersingular primes for every elliptic curve over <m> \mathbf { Q } </m> '' , inventiones 89 -LRB- 1987 -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- . in other words , in the special case the pair <m> ( f _ { E _ { \mathfrak { p } } } ( x ) , j _ E </m> mod <m> \mathfrak { p } ) </m> does <m> { \it n o t } </m> determine <m> T _ 2 ( E _ \mathfrak { p } ) </m> . here is the question then : in the special case can we determine what is the endomorphism ring of <m> E _ \mathfrak { p } </m> -LRB- and hence <m> T _ 2 ( E ) </m> -RRB- from congruences of <m> j _ E </m> mod a higher power of <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> -LRB- or of <m> p </m> -RRB- ? it is not even clear to me whether this should be possible , let alone what power of <m> p </m> we would need to tell one case from the other . the hope behind this is that the <m> j </m> - invariant of <m> E </m> be `` close '' to that of the cm lift of <m> E _ \mathfrak { p } </m> and of its endomorphisms ring over <m> k _ \mathfrak { p } </m> . thanks . ps : i do not know if the question above has anything to do with is there a `` classical '' proof of this <m> j </m> - value congruence ? -LSB- edit : i realize that for clarity of exposition i should have probably recalled that <m> T _ \ell ( E _ \mathfrak { p } ) </m> for <m> \ell \neq p </m> , in the above notation , is a free <m> { \rm E n d } ( E _ \mathfrak { p } ) \otimes \mathbf { Z } _ \ell </m> - module of rank one . therefore , roughly , the knowledge of either of the two is equivalent to that of the other -RSB-
assuming that <m> p </m> is an odd prime . how many primes have the form <m> ( 2 ^ p + 1 ) / 3 </m> ? is the number finite ? mathematica calculation shows that there are 23 such primes when <m> p </m> ranges over the first 500 primes . here are those primes <m> p </m> , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 , 19 , 23 , 31 , 43 , 61 , 79 , 101 , 127 , 167 , 191 , 199 , 313 , 347 , 701 , 1709 , 2617 , 3539 originally , i am concerned with prime powers of the form <m> ( 2 ^ m + 1 ) / 3 </m> , where <m> m > 0 </m> is an odd number . this number can be a prime power only when <m> m </m> is an odd prime . according to a result of t. n. shorrey and r. tijdeman -LRB- math . scand . 39 , 5-18 -LRB- 1976 -RRB- -RRB- , there are only finite number of such primer powers that are not primes , though i still do n't know how many . mathematica calculation seems to suggest there are no such prime powers that are not primes .

the `` traditional '' approach to the so-called `` field with one element '' <m> \mathbb { F } _ { 1 } </m> is by using monoids , or , to put it in another way , by forgetting the additive structure of rings . in deitmar 's approach to the subject , <m> \mathbb { F } _ { 1 } </m> is declared to be the trivial monoid <m> \{ 1 \} </m> . furthermore , <m> \mathbb { F } _ { 1 } </m> - modules -LRB- or vector spaces , since we are calling <m> \mathbb { F } _ { 1 } </m> a `` field '' after all , although it 's not really a field -RRB- are pointed sets , and <m> \mathbb { F } _ { 1 } </m> - algebras are commutative monoids . the motivations for these ideas may predate deitmar 's work , and these ideas may also be found in this unpublished work by kapranov and smirnov . deitmar 's approach is kind of a `` template '' for later approaches to the field with one element , such as the one by toen and vaquie . however , one approach that is different is the one by borger . in this approach , <m> \mathbb { F } _ { 1 } </m> - algebras are lambda rings , which are rings together with frobenius lifts . the idea is that the extra structure provided by the frobenius lifts serves as descent data to <m> \mathbb { F } _ { 1 } </m> , while the forgetful functor that forgets that extra structure is the base change to <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> , i.e. it is the functor <m> - \otimes _ { \mathbb { F } _ { 1 } } \mathbb { Z } </m> . in other words , the <m> \mathbb { F } _ { 1 } </m> - algebras have less structure than rings -LRB- <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - algebras -RRB- in deitmar 's approach , while they have more structure in borger 's approach . but it is often said that the two are related ; in fact the nlab article on the field with one element claims that borger 's approach subsumes many aspects of previous approaches . for instance , in lieven le bruyn 's paper , absolute geometry and the habiro topology , it is shown that in borger 's approach one can arrive at the idea of soule -LRB- also apparently going back to kapranov and smirnov -RRB- that <m> \mathbb { F } _ { 1 ^ { n } } \otimes _ { \mathbb { F } _ { 1 } } \mathbb { Z } = \mathbb { Z } [ \mu _ { n } ] </m> . in what other ways is borger 's approach related to these other approaches ? with ideas similar to lambda rings apparently finding their way into algebraic topology and homotopy theory -LRB- e.g. adams operations in cohomotopy by guillot and power operations and absolute geometry by morava and santhanam -RRB- , do we have an analogue of toen and vaquie 's `` schemes over <m> \mathbb { S } </m> '' and related homotopy-theoretic constructions ? what about connes and consani 's `` arithmetic site ? '' can we obtain analogous constructions but with lambda rings instead of commutative monoids playing the role of <m> \mathbb { F } _ { 1 } </m> - algebras ?
building on this question scaling the imaginary part of <m> \rho </m> s in infinite products , i like to conjecture that : <m> \displaystyle \prod _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \left ( 1 - \frac { s } { \mu _ n } \right ) \left ( 1 - \frac { s } { 1 - \mu _ n } \right ) \left ( 1 - \frac { s } { \overline { \mu _ n } } \right ) \left ( 1 - \frac { s } { \overline { 1 - \mu _ n } } \right ) </m> with <m> \mu _ n = a + \Im ( \rho _ n ) x i </m> and <m> a , x \in \mathbb { R } , x \ne 0 , s \in \mathbb { C } </m> and <m> \rho _ n </m> the n-th non-trivial zero of <m> \zeta ( z ) </m> , has the following closed form : <m> \displaystyle H ( s , a , x ) : = \frac { \xi ( \frac 1 2 - \frac { a } { x } + \frac { s } { x } ) } { \xi ( \frac 1 2 - \frac { a } { x } ) } \frac { \xi ( \frac 1 2 - \frac { a } { x } + \frac { 1 } { x } - \frac { s } { x } ) } { \xi ( \frac 1 2 - \frac { a } { x } + \frac { 1 } { x } ) } </m> where <m> \xi ( z ) = \frac 1 2 z ( z - 1 ) \pi ^ { - \frac { z } { 2 } } \Gamma ( \frac { z } { 2 } ) \zeta ( z ) </m> is the riemann xi-function . if this formula is correct , the ` constructed ' zeros <m> \mu _ n </m> can be stretched/condensed vertically via <m> x </m> on the imaginary axis and shifted left/right on the real line via <m> a </m> . in all cases they would yield an entire function expressed by this closed form -LRB- think of it as a reversed application of the weierstrass factorization theorem , i.e. starting with products of ` constructed ' zeros -RRB- . further factorization also seems possible with : <m> \frac { \xi ( \frac 1 2 - \frac { a } { x } + \frac { s } { x } ) } { \xi ( \frac 1 2 - \frac { a } { x } ) } = \prod _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \left ( 1 - \frac { s } { \mu _ n } \right ) \left ( 1 - \frac { s } { \overline { \mu _ n } } \right ) </m> and <m> \frac { \xi ( \frac 1 2 - \frac { a } { x } + \frac { 1 } { x } - \frac { s } { x } ) } { \xi ( \frac 1 2 - \frac { a } { x } + \frac { 1 } { x } ) } = \prod _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \left ( 1 - \frac { s } { 1 - \mu _ n } \right ) \left ( 1 - \frac { s } { \overline { 1 - \mu _ n } } \right ) </m> when <m> a = \frac 1 2 </m> and <m> x = 1 </m> , the formula correctly reduces to : <m> \frac { \xi ( s ) } { \xi ( 0 ) } = \prod _ { \rho } \left ( 1 - \frac { s } { \rho } \right ) \left ( 1 - \frac { s } { 1 - \rho } \right ) </m> from which the known hadamard product for <m> \zeta ( s ) </m> can been derived . unfortunately i do not have a proof for this formula , however rigorously checked it against many ` brute force ' calculations using the first 2mln <m> \rho </m> s -LRB- all correct results , but accurate up to 5 decimals max -RRB- . i manufactured the formula by replicating the symmetry of the closed form for <m> \mu _ n = a + n x i </m> -LRB- i.e. running through the integers rather than <m> \Im ( \rho _ n ) </m> , see the linked question -RRB- . since until today , all non-trivial zeros appear to be lying on the critical line , i have used <m> \frac 1 2 </m> as the `` source '' for all zeros for different <m> a </m> 's i.e. : <m> \frac 1 2 - \frac { a } { x } + \frac { s } { x } </m> just inserts <m> \frac 1 2 </m> when <m> \Re ( s ) = a </m> . i guess i have thereby implicitly assumed the rh in constructing the formula . my questions :
-LRB- this was posted previously in mse without getting any answers . -RRB- it is known that given primitive -LRB- co-prime -RRB- integer solutions to , <m> x _ 1 ^ 4 + x _ 2 ^ 4 + x _ 3 ^ 4 + x _ 4 ^ 4 = z ^ 4 </m> then there is one <m> x _ i </m> such that <m> z ^ 4 - x _ i ^ 4 </m> is divisible by <m> d _ 4 = 5 ^ 4 </m> . additionally , ward showed that if one of the <m> x _ i </m> is zero , then there is the further constraint that <m> z \pm x _ j </m> is divisible by <m> w _ 4 = 2 ^ { 1 0 } </m> . for example , <m> 6 7 3 8 6 5 ^ 4 + 1 3 9 0 4 0 0 ^ 4 + 2 7 6 7 6 2 4 ^ 4 = 2 8 1 3 0 0 1 ^ 4 </m> and , <m> z + x _ 3 = 2 8 1 3 0 0 1 + 2 7 6 7 6 2 4 = 5 ^ 4 \cdot 8 9 2 9 </m> <m> z - x _ 1 = 2 8 1 3 0 0 1 - 6 7 3 8 6 5 = 2 ^ { 1 0 } \cdot 2 0 8 9 </m>

from grothendieck 's work we know that the prime-to-p fundamental group <m> \pi _ 1 ( \mathbb { P } ^ 1 _ { \overline { \mathbb { F } _ p } } \setminus \{ a _ 1 , . . . , a _ r \} ) </m> where <m> a _ 1 , . . . , a _ r \in \mathbb { F } _ p </m> is isomorphic to the prime-to-p part of the profinite completion of <m> \langle \alpha _ 1 , . . . , \alpha _ r | \alpha _ 1 . . . \alpha _ r = 1 \rangle </m> . the question is : how does the frobenius automorphism of <m> \overline { \mathbb { F } _ p } </m> act on the prime-to-p <m> \pi _ 1 ( \mathbb { P } ^ 1 _ { \overline { \mathbb { F } _ p } } \setminus \{ a _ 1 , . . . , a _ r \} ) </m> where <m> a _ 1 , . . . , a _ r \in \mathbb { F } _ p </m> ? i do n't actually expect an answer . i gather that this is not well understood . my question is : what is known about it ? where can i read more ? and in general any insight about this question is very welcome . i put a community wiki stamp on this because there 's no one right answer .
if <m> M ^ { 4 k } </m> is an oriented riemannian <m> 4 k </m> - manifold , then the star-operator splits the bundle <m> \Lambda ^ { 2 k } </m> into <m> \pm 1 </m> - eigenspace bundles denoted <m> \Lambda ^ { 2 k } _ { \pm } </m> . i 'm curious if anyone has ever computed <m> p _ k ( \Lambda ^ { 2 k } _ { \pm } ) </m> in terms of the pontryagin classes and euler class of the tangent bundle . -LRB- i 'm still a bit sketchy on characteristic classes but from what i know this should be possible . also , as a geometer i 'm primarily thinking in terms of chern-weil theory . -RRB- i know the answer when <m> k = 1 </m> -LRB- when you integrate the class in question you get <m> 2 \chi ( T M ) \pm p _ 1 ( T M ) </m> -RRB- but i played around with the <m> k = 2 </m> case for a bit and ran into a hell of a computation , and i 've done a bunch of searches and ca n't seem to find any relevant literature . -LRB- i 'd also be curious to know about pontryagin classes of the other bundles of forms if anyone knows about them . -RRB-
in the paper `` sato-tate distributions and galois endomorphism modules in genus 2 '' -LRB- arxiv : http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6638 -RRB- , the authors use the singular homology <m> H _ 1 ( A _ \mathbb { C } ^ { t o p } , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> -LRB- <m> A </m> is an abelian variety -RRB- . i have seen this construction other places , but most recently here . i am not that well versed in homolgy but i looked up what the singular homology is and i think i understand it . however i do n't see what it represents in the abelian variety case . in the paper they state that if <m> V _ \ell ( A ) </m> is the rational tate-module then <m> V _ \ell ( A ) \cong H _ 1 ( A _ \mathbb { C } ^ { t o p } , \mathbb { Q } ) \otimes \mathbb { Q } _ \ell </m> i have studied a bit on abelian varieties over finite fields and in that case we get <m> V _ \ell ( A ) \cong T _ \ell ( A ) \otimes \mathbb { Q } _ \ell </m> where <m> T _ \ell ( A ) </m> is the -LRB- non-rational -RRB- tate-module . from there we get that <m> A ( \mathbb { F } _ q ) _ \ell \cong T _ \ell ( A ) / ( 1 - F ) T _ \ell ( A ) </m> where <m> F </m> is the frobenius . morever <m> V _ \ell ( A ) \cong V _ \ell ( B ) </m> if and only if <m> A \sim B </m> . that is , the relationship between <m> T _ \ell ( A ) </m> and <m> V _ \ell ( A ) </m> gives a way to look at the group that can appear inside a isogeny classes . is the relationship between <m> V _ \ell ( A ) </m> and <m> H _ 1 ( A _ \mathbb { C } ^ { t o p } , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> similar for abelian varieties not over finite fields as the relationship between <m> V _ \ell ( A ) </m> and <m> T _ \ell ( A ) </m> ? obviously it wo n't be exactly the same as we do not have a frobenius endomorphism . if not , what is the relevance of <m> H _ 1 ( A _ \mathbb { C } ^ { t o p } , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> and what can we interpret it as ?
let <m> G </m> be an affine group scheme of finite type over a field <m> k </m> . it is well known that the associated reduced subscheme <m> G _ { \operatorname { r e d } } </m> of <m> G </m> is a subgroup if <m> k </m> is perfect . so let us assume that <m> k </m> is perfect . in general , <m> G _ { \operatorname { r e d } } </m> is not normal in <m> G </m> -LRB- see sga 3 , vi <m> _ A </m> , 0.2 -RRB- . the wikipedia page on groupschemes claimes that <m> G _ { \operatorname { r e d } } </m> is normal in <m> G </m> if <m> G </m> is connected . i would be very thankful if somebody could point me to a proof of this .

i was thinking about the proof of the lefschetz 's fixed point theorem and the ingeniuty of the hopf 's trace formula , i.e. associating the trace of the matrix for deciding about the fixed points . now suppose for any finite-dimensional simplex <m> K </m> i have the <m> i </m> - th homology group with rational coefficients , <m> H _ i ( K , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> and <m> f : K \rightarrow K </m> . then we have the induced map <m> f _ * : H _ i ( K , \mathbb { Q } ) \rightarrow H _ i ( K , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> . since <m> f _ * </m> is a map from a finite-dimensional vetor space to itself , we can talk about its matrix and the alternating sum of the trace of the matrices of <m> i </m> - th homology groups give the lefschetz 's number for <m> f </m> . 1 -RRB- i was wondering that what could be the <m> m o t i v a t i o n / i n s i g h t </m> behind using the trace of the matrix of <m> f _ * </m> for various purposes . 2 -RRB- again , for any matrix , its trace as well as determinant are invariants , so i was wondering that are there any instances where we use the determinant of <m> f _ * </m> for associating something like lefschetz 's number . is there any example in the literature where the determinant of <m> f _ * </m> serves any purpose or is this just a vague idea . i tried to think about the 2nd question by taking some simplicial maps for lower-dimensional simplexes , but could n't get anything promising . i searched about it on the internet , but could n't find anything substantial .

is there a method to find a tight upper bound on the given integral ? note that the integral is upper bounded by <m> \sqrt { \pi / 2 } </m> , and thus converges . i first thought about applying laplace 's method . however , the function <m> - x ^ 2 / 2 - a ( 1 - e ^ { - x } ) </m> is decreasing and achieves maximum at <m> x = 0 </m> which is an endpoint of the domain of integration . as a result , i do n't think using laplace method is a good idea to find an upper bound . numerical evaluation indicates an asymptotic of <m> \sim \frac { 1 } { a } </m> , but i am not sure how to proceed to say anything about an upper bound in terms of <m> a </m> . any ideas ? thanks in advance .
let <m> \mathcal { M } _ { 0 , n } </m> denote the moduli stack of <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> 's equipped with <m> n </m> distinct sections . my understanding is that <m> \mathcal { M } _ { 0 , 3 } </m> is a point , so <m> \mathcal { M } _ { 0 , 4 } </m> is a scheme , isomorphic to <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 - \{ 0 , 1 , \infty \} </m> . this has fundamental group <m> F _ 2 </m> -LRB- the free group of rank 2 -RRB- , and so <m> \mathcal { M } _ { 0 , 5 } </m> is a fibration over <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 - \{ 0 , 1 , \infty \} </m> with fibers isomorphic to 4-times punctured <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> 's . my question is - is there a good description of the fundamental groups of <m> \mathcal { M } _ { 0 , n } </m> ? -LRB- say , over <m> \overline { \mathbb { Q } } </m> -RRB- . are they ever trivial ?
we can write the finitary special unitary group <m> S U ( \infty ) </m> as the direct limit <m> \varinjlim S U ( n ) </m> of ordinary special unitary groups . these groups <m> S U ( n ) </m> are compact , thus amenable . in other words each of them has an invariant mean -LRB- in this case , from haar measure -RRB- . is <m> S U ( \infty ) </m> amenable ? of course one then asks the same question for the full unitary group <m> U ( \infty ) </m> , the special orthogonal group <m> S O ( \infty ) </m> and the unitary symplectic -LRB- quaternion unitary -RRB- group <m> S p ( \infty ) </m> .
i have decided to edit my post a bit heavily for clarity . i was trying to be fairly general but it 's hard to see what i 'm asking so i 've decided to limit myself to a specific example which will hopefully make it clearer . suppose i have an integral operator <m> T </m> that can be defined on two distinct -LRB- zero intersection -RRB- subspaces <m> S _ 1 </m> and <m> S _ 2 </m> of <m> L ^ 2 ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> which is not a priori bounded . that is to say that for <m> f \in S _ 1 </m> or <m> f \in S _ 2 </m> , <m> T f </m> exists pointwise almost everywhere and is given by <m> T f ( y ) = \int _ { - \infty } ^ { \infty } k ( x , y ) f ( x ) d x </m> for some kernel <m> k </m> . suppose then that on <m> S _ 1 </m> i can actually show that <m> T f \in L ^ 2 ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> and <m> \| T f \| \le C \| f \| </m> . since <m> S _ 1 </m> is dense in <m> L ^ 2 ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> , <m> T </m> can be extended to a bounded operator on all of <m> L ^ 2 ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> . call the extension <m> \widetilde { T } </m> . however this extension need not -LRB- and in many cases will not -RRB- be an integral operator on all of <m> L ^ 2 ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> . clearly , <m> \widetilde { T } | _ { S _ 2 } </m> is a bounded operator but is it the case that <m> \widetilde { T } | _ { S _ 2 } </m> is actually an integral operator ? if so , does it agree identically with the definition above ?
we know that <m> \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { n } \binom { n } { i } = 2 ^ n </m> and that <m> \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { n } \binom { n } { i } ^ 2 = \binom { 2 n } { n } </m> what about <m> \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { n } \binom { n } { i } ^ 3 </m> ?
let <m> G </m> be a compact connected semisimple lie group , <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> be its complexified lie algebra and <m> \mathfrak { g } ^ * </m> its complex dual space . we can form the symmetric algebra <m> S ( \mathfrak { g } ^ * ) </m> and its <m> G </m> - invariant subalgebra <m> S ( \mathfrak { g } ^ * ) ^ G </m> . for a closed connected subgroup <m> H < G </m> we have the same construction and get <m> S ( \mathfrak { h } ^ * ) ^ H </m> . since <m> \mathfrak { h } \hookrightarrow \mathfrak { g } </m> we get <m> \mathfrak { g } ^ * \twoheadrightarrow \mathfrak { h } ^ * </m> hence <m> S ( \mathfrak { g } ^ * ) \twoheadrightarrow S ( \mathfrak { h } ^ * ) </m> . take invariant subalgebra we get the map <m> \phi : S ( \mathfrak { g } ^ * ) ^ G \rightarrow S ( \mathfrak { h } ^ * ) ^ H . </m> notice that <m> \phi </m> is not always a projection map . for example when <m> H = T </m> is a cartan subalgebra , then it is well-known that <m> S ( \mathfrak { g } ^ * ) ^ G \cong S ( \mathfrak { t } ^ * ) ^ W </m> is the invariant subalgebra under the weyl group action and <m> S ( \mathfrak { t } ^ * ) ^ T = S ( \mathfrak { t } ^ * ) </m> since <m> T </m> is abelian . therefore <m> \phi : S ( \mathfrak { g } ^ * ) ^ G \rightarrow S ( \mathfrak { t } ^ * ) ^ T </m> is the embedding -LRB- injective but not surjective -RRB- . my question is : for which <m> H </m> , the map <m> \phi </m> is injective ? we know that <m> H = G </m> itself or <m> H </m> is a cartan subgroup makes <m> \phi </m> an injection . are these the only cases ?
it 's a well-known open problem -LRB- sophie-germain primes -RRB- whether there are infinitely many primes <m> p </m> , <m> 2 p + 1 </m> . what about <m> p </m> , <m> 2 p - 1 </m> ? seemingly it 's also an open problem -LRB- see here and the linked question -RRB- . i am aware that it is a special case of more general open problems . but i 'd like a concrete reference asserting that this specific problem is indeed open . edit : as i said , i 'm not interested in more general conjectures . it 's suitable for mo , because no one has given me a reference for this exact problem .
cross-posted from https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/65195/minimum-cardinality-of-a-difference-set-in-mathbb-rn . given a finite set <m> S </m> of <m> m </m> points in <m> \mathbb R ^ n </m> that do not all lie in the same <m> ( n - 1 ) </m> - dimensional hyperplane , consider the set of difference vectors : <m> \{ x - y \, | \, x , y \in S \} </m> what is the minimum cardinality of this set , as a function of <m> m </m> and <m> n </m> ? -LRB- the sets that minimize this should be `` small '' subsets of a lattice , but i do n't know what specific shapes minimize it . -RRB- what is the status of exact results for this problem for small <m> n </m> -LRB- say <m> n = 2 </m> or <m> 3 </m> -RRB- ?
i tried to prove the green-julg isomorphism in some notion of kk-theory , but came to this basic problem : let <m> G </m> a finite group . equip <m> K : = K ( \ell ^ 2 ( G ) ) </m> -LRB- compact operators -RRB- with the left translation induced action <m> L : G \rightarrow B ( \ell ^ 2 ( G ) ) </m> and the right translation induced action <m> R : G \rightarrow B ( \ell ^ 2 ( G ) ) </m> . -LRB- to be precise , <m> L = A d ( U ) </m> of left action <m> U </m> on <m> \ell ^ 2 ( G ) </m> . -RRB- consider two <m> * </m> - homomorphisms <m> \alpha , \beta : \mathbb { C } \rtimes G \rightarrow K \rtimes _ R G , </m> where <m> \alpha </m> is the left regular representation into <m> K </m> and some averaging projection in <m> G </m> , and <m> \beta </m> injects canonically into the crossed products and takes some averaging projection in <m> K </m> . more precisely , <m> \alpha ( \lambda \rtimes g ) = \lambda L _ g \rtimes \frac { 1 } { | G | } \sum _ { h \in G } h </m> and <m> \beta ( \lambda \rtimes g ) = \lambda \sum _ { h \in G } \frac { 1 } { | G | } R _ h \rtimes g . </m> could <m> \alpha </m> and <m> \beta </m> be homotopic ? or could at least <m> \alpha ( p ) </m> and <m> \beta ( p ) </m> be homotopic projections for some projection <m> p </m> ?
consider the set of polynomials with real coefficients as a vector space with the following inner-product : <m> \langle f , g \rangle = \int _ { a } ^ { b } f ( x ) g ( x ) d x </m> . hilbert showed , in a paper from 1894 , that the norm -LRB- with respect to this inner-product -RRB- of a non-zero polynomial in <m> \mathbb { Z } [ X ] </m> can get arbitrarily small when <m> b - a < 4 </m> . in other words , <m> \min _ { 0 \neq p \in \mathbb { Z } [ X ] } \int _ { a } ^ { b } p ^ 2 ( x ) d x = 0 </m> . my questions are :
let <m> X </m> be a topological space and <m> \mu </m> be the borel measure on <m> X </m> . suppose <m> W _ 1 </m> and <m> W _ 2 </m> are continuous , non-negative functions from <m> X </m> into the real numbers such that , for all integers <m> p > 0 </m> , <m> \int _ X W _ i ( x ) \ d \mu ( x ) < + \infty , \ \ i = 1 , 2 . </m> define the weighted <m> \mathcal { L } ^ p </m> - space <m> \mathcal { L } _ W ^ p ( X ) </m> as the space of measurable functions from <m> X </m> to the reals for which the integral <m> \left ( \int _ X f ( x ) ^ p W ( x ) \ d \mu ( x ) \right ) ^ { 1 / p } </m> is finite . in this case the function <m> W </m> is called the weight function for <m> \mathcal { L } _ W ^ p </m> . furthermore , it is well known that the integral above constitutes a norm on <m> \mathcal { L } ^ p _ W ( X ) </m> . under which conditions on the weight functions <m> W _ 1 </m> and <m> W _ 2 </m> are <m> \mathcal { L } _ { W _ 1 } ^ p ( X ) </m> and <m> \mathcal { L } ^ p _ { W _ 2 } ( X ) </m> topologically isomorphic ? -LRB- i.e. when is there a banach space isomorphism which is also a homeomorphism with respect to the norm-topologies due to the two weight functions ? -RRB-
let <m> R </m> be a ring with unity -LRB- not necessarily commutative -RRB- . let <m> { } _ R M o d </m> be the category of left <m> R </m> - modules . if <m> { } _ R M o d </m> has a projective generator with commutative endomorphism ring , then does <m> { } _ R M o d </m> have a finitely generated projective generator with commutative endomorphism ring ?
morel and voevodsky construct the motivic stable homotopy category , a category through which all cohomology theories factor and where they are representable , by starting with a category of schemes , yoneda-embedding it into simplicial presheaves , endowing those with the <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 1 </m> - local model structure , and then passing to <m> S ^ 1 \wedge \mathbb { G } _ m </m> - spectra . the last step ensures that smashing with <m> S ^ 1 </m> or with <m> \mathbb { G } _ m </m> induce functors with a quasi-inverse on the homotopy category . inverting <m> S ^ 1 </m> leads to a triangulated structure on the homotopy category , which is very welcome , but i would like a motivation for inverting <m> \mathbb { G } _ m </m> . since <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> is <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 1 </m> - equivalent to <m> S ^ 1 \wedge \mathbb { G } _ m </m> i would also be content with a motivation to invert <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> .
let <m> M </m> be a separable von neumann algebra and let <m> A </m> be a -LRB- von neumann - -RRB- dense * - subalgebra . suppose that <m> \alpha , \alpha _ 1 , \alpha _ 2 , \dots </m> are automorphisms of <m> M </m> , such that for every <m> a \in A </m> , <m> \alpha _ n ( a ) = \alpha ( a ) </m> for all <m> n </m> sufficiently large . does it follow that <m> \alpha _ n </m> converges to <m> \alpha </m> in the <m> u </m> - topology ? -LRB- also : what about if we weaken the hypothesis to just assuming that <m> \alpha _ n ( a ) </m> converges in norm to <m> \alpha ( a ) </m> , for all <m> a \in A </m> ? -RRB- this question is inspired by a related mo question , where an explicit example was requested of a sequence of inner automorphisms on the hyperfinite <m> I I I _ 1 </m> - -LRB- or <m> I I _ 1 </m> - -RRB- factor which converge to an outer automorphism . an answer involved a sequence of inner automorphisms satisfying , in particular , the hypotheses of my question , although the proof of convergence uses more information . perhaps other examples answering that question would be available if the answer to my question is yes .
i am reading ben andrews book about ricci flow and at the start of the chapter about perelman 's gradient flow formulation for ricci flow he says robert bryant exposed that there are no functionals defined on the <m> L ^ 2 </m> - space of riemannian metrics that promotes ricci flow as a gradient flow . does anyone know the name of this paper ? the book does not include it on their references .

let <m> \Delta </m> be a zariski dense finitely generated subgroup of <m> S L ( 3 , \mathbb { R } ) </m> . assume that <m> \Delta </m> contains no element of finite order . then , does there exist a finite-order element <m> A \in S L ( 3 , \mathbb { R } ) </m> such that the group generated by all the elements of <m> \Delta </m> and <m> A </m> contains <m> \Delta </m> as a finite index subgroup ? we assume that <m> A </m> is not an identity . is there some known conditions for <m> \Delta </m> that the above statement holds ?
question : suppose that <m> f </m> is an entire function -LRB- i.e. analytic in <m> \mathbb { C } </m> -RRB- , and satisfies the condition <m> \iint _ { \mathbb { C } } | f | ^ p d x d y < \infty </m> for some <m> p \in ( 0 , 1 ) </m> . i guess that <m> f \equiv 0 </m> but i do not know how to prove it . note . if <m> p \in [ 1 , \infty ) </m> , it is easy to prove that <m> f \equiv 0 </m> . in the settting <m> p \in ( 0 , 1 ) </m> , one should deal with the integral of an entire function near the essential singularity point <m> \infty </m> carefully . edit . thank alexandre eremenko for his answer . i also want to know the solution to the following harmonic version of question . question -LRB- h -RRB- : suppose that <m> f </m> is a harmonic function -LRB- <m> i . e . \Delta f = 0 </m> , <m> f </m> may be complex-harmonic in <m> \mathbb { C } </m> -RRB- , and satisfies the condition <m> \iint _ { \mathbb { C } } | f | ^ p d x d y < \infty </m> for some <m> p \in ( 0 , 1 ) . </m> i believe that <m> f \equiv 0 </m> .
let <m> A </m> be a finite dimensional algebra and assume all modules are also finite dimensional . a module <m> M </m> is said to have dominant dimension at least <m> n </m> in case the term <m> I _ i </m> for <m> i = 0 , 1 , . . . , n - 1 </m> are projective when <m> ( I _ i ) </m> denotes a minimal injective coresolution of <m> M </m> . the dominant dimension of the algebra is the dominant dimension of the regular module <m> A </m> . a module <m> M </m> is said to be <m> r </m> - torsionfree in case <m> E x t _ A ^ i ( D ( A ) , \tau ( M ) ) = 0 </m> for <m> i = 1 , 2 , . . . , r </m> . note that this generalises the classical concept of reflexive modules , which are exactly the 2-torsionfree modules . i have the following conjecture :
with <m> V \subset H \subset V ' </m> a hilbert triple -LRB- separable spaces as well -RRB- , let 's consider <m> u ' + A u = f </m> in <m> L ^ 2 ( 0 , T ; V ' ) </m> , where <m> A : V \to V ' </m> is bounded and linear . if <m> V \subset H </m> is not compact , then the hilbert-schmidt theory does n't apply to <m> A </m> , i.e , its eigenfunctions do not form a orthonormal basis of <m> H </m> . so we just have a basis of <m> V </m> and <m> H </m> called <m> \{ \varphi _ j \} </m> . how then can i obtain a bound on <m> \lVert u _ m ' \rVert _ { L ^ 2 ( 0 , T ; V ' ) } </m> ? here <m> u _ m ' </m> is the finite-dimensional solution of <m> \langle u _ m ' , \varphi _ j \rangle + \langle A u _ m , \varphi _ j \rangle = \langle f , \varphi _ j \rangle </m> for <m> j = 1 , . . . , m . </m> we can define a projection <m> P _ m : H \to V _ m </m> with <m>  </m> v _ m \ in v _ m <m>  </m> which is clearly bounded from <m> H \to H </m> . but we require a bound on <m> P _ m : V \to V </m> since the bilinear form <m> A </m> generates is bounded in <m> V \times V </m> . obtaining this bound is easy to do when the basis are the eigenfunctions . but i do n't know how to obtain this bound in this circumstance when the basis is not the eigenfunctions . are there any alternate techniques to get this bound ? thank you .

what is the dual to <m> L ^ \infty ( I , H ^ 1 ( M ) ) </m> ? , where <m> I </m> is an interval in the real line ; <m> H ^ 1 ( M ) </m> is sobolev space of degree 1 , and <m> M </m> is a compact manifold like the torus . any references that show that is appreciated .
i am interested in literature/results characterizing the dual of the fractional sobolev space <m> W ^ { s , p } ( \Omega ) </m> , where <m> \Omega \subset \mathbb { R } ^ N </m> is open , bounded , and smooth , <m> 0 < s < 1 </m> , and <m> 1 < p < \infty </m> . for example , we can characterize the dual of <m> W _ 0 ^ { 1 , 2 } ( \Omega ) </m> as follows . if <m> f \in W ^ { 1 , 2 } ( \Omega ) </m> then there exist <m> f _ i \in L ^ 2 ( \Omega ) </m> such that -LRB- for <m> v \in W ^ { 1 , 2 } _ 0 ( \Omega ) </m> -RRB- <m> \langle f , v \rangle = \int _ \Omega f _ 0 v + \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ N f _ i v _ { x _ i } \; d x </m> , and so we write <m> f = f _ 0 - \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ N ( f _ i ) _ { x _ i } </m> . a similar characterization holds for the dual of <m> W _ 0 ^ { 1 , p } ( \Omega ) </m> , where instead the <m> f _ i </m> are in <m> L ^ p ( \Omega ) </m> -LRB- though i do not have a reference for this - the <m> W _ 0 ^ { 1 , 2 } </m> case can be bound in evan 's pde book -RRB- . my question is do we have such a representation <m> f = f _ 0 + ( - \Delta ) ^ \frac { s } { 2 } f _ 1 </m> , for <m> f _ 0 , f _ 1 \in L ^ p ( \Omega ) </m> , or something like this ?
let <m> n \in \mathbb { N } </m> be a positive integer . we say that an <m> n \times n </m> - matrix <m> A </m> with all entries in <m> \{ 0 , 1 \} </m> is <m> k </m> - regular for some <m> k \in \{ 0 , \ldots , n \} </m> if the sum of every row and the sum of every column of <m> A </m> equals <m> k </m> . let <m> M ( n , k ) </m> be the number of <m> k </m> - regular <m> n \times n </m> - matrices with all entries in <m> \{ 0 , 1 \} </m> . it 's easy to see that <m> M ( n , 1 ) = n ! </m> . moreover , a symmetry argument shows that <m> M ( n , k ) = M ( n , n - k ) </m> for all <m> k \in \{ 0 , \ldots , n \} </m> . question . given <m> n > 1 </m> , is it true that for all <m> k \in \{ 0 , \ldots , n \} </m> we have <m> M ( n , k ) \leq M ( n , \lfloor \frac { n } { 2 } \rfloor ) </m> ?
for nakayama algebras <m> A </m> with a linear quiver and at most 7 points -LRB- which are 196 algebras -RRB- the following was true : <m> m a x \{ d i m ( E x t _ A ^ 2 ( S , A ) ) | S </m> simple <m> \} = m a x \{ d i m ( E x t _ A ^ 2 ( X , A ) ) | X </m> indecomposable <m> \} . </m> question :
let <m> X </m> be a banach space with continuous dual space <m> X ' </m> with norm topology . let us regard the following property of <m> X </m> : property : any linear subset <m> A \subset X ' </m> that satisfies <m> \bigcap _ { \alpha \in A } \ker \alpha = \{ 0 \} </m> is dense in <m> X ' </m> . any reflexive space <m> X </m> has this property . can you classify the spaces that share this property ? i wonder whether it is equivalent to reflexivity .
let <m> X </m> be the total space of <m> \mathscr { O } ( - 1 ) ^ { \oplus { n } } \rightarrow \mathbb { P } ^ m </m> . i think there should be some general way to compute its quantum cohomology <m> Q H ^ \ast ( X ) </m> . however , since i 'm not familiar with these things , i found it hard to carry out the computations directly by hand without assuming that <m> m \gg n </m> , or both of <m> m </m> and <m> n </m> are very small , and of course it 's trivial when <m> n = 1 </m> . when <m> m \gg n </m> , by checking dimensions one sees easily that the degrees of the holomorphic curves must be 0 or 1 in order to obtain non-trivial gromov-witten invariants , but this simplification does not seem to happen in general . is there any coherent way to compute <m> Q H ^ \ast ( X ) </m> for all the possible <m> m , n \geq 1 </m> ? i think the problem should be trivial to experts and it 's quite possible that it can be found in the literature .
theorem : in this paper of frei and levesque , they correct the proof of a result of halter-koch and stender : define the real pure algebraic number field <m> \mathbb { K } = \mathbb { Q } ( \omega _ n ) </m> for <m> \omega _ n = \sqrt [ n ] { D ^ n \pm d } > 0 </m> -LRB- the <m> \pm </m> sign is fixed -RRB- , where <m> d , D , n \in \mathbb { Z } ^ + </m> such that <m> d | D ^ n </m> and <m> D ^ n \pm d </m> is not a <m> k ^ { \text { t h } } </m> - power positive integer for <m> k | n </m> . let <m> \epsilon _ { n , k } = \frac { ( \omega _ n - D ) ^ k } { \omega _ n ^ k - D ^ k } </m> . then the set <m> \{ \epsilon _ { n , k } : k \in \mathbb { Z } _ { \ge 2 } , k | n \} </m> is an independent system of units in <m> \mathbb { K } </m> . background : i am looking specifically at computing units of algebraic number fields of the form <m> \mathbb { Q } ( \sqrt [ p ] { t } ) </m> for odd primes <m> p </m> -LRB- any infinite family in <m> t \in \mathbb { Z } ^ + </m> , with <m> p </m> fixed -RRB- . unfortunately , the above result gives only one unit <m> \frac { ( \omega _ p - D ) ^ p } { \omega _ p ^ p - D ^ p } </m> . question : are there results on obtaining at least one other independent -LRB- non-torsion -RRB- unit ? note : for irreducible <m> x ^ p - t </m> there is one real root <m> \sqrt [ p ] { t } </m> and <m> p - 1 </m> non-real complex roots <m> \zeta _ p ^ i \sqrt [ p ] { t } </m> for <m> i = 1 , \ldots , p - 1 </m> and <m> \zeta _ p = e ^ { \frac { 2 \pi i } { p } } </m> . then by dirichlet 's unit theorem , the unit rank of <m> \mathbb { Q } ( \sqrt [ p ] { t } ) </m> is <m> 1 + \frac { p - 1 } { 2 } - 1 = \frac { p - 1 } { 2 } </m> . thus i am especially interested in <m> p = 5 </m> where there can be at most two independent units .
for any spectrum <m> E </m> , there is a `` discrete '' topos spectrum <m> ( S p a c e s / E _ n ) _ n </m> . and i believe any topos spectrum is a localization of a `` discrete '' one . are there any `` non-discrete '' topos spectra ? to be precise , let <m> T o p o i </m> be the <m> \infty </m> - category of <m> \infty </m> - topoi and geometric morphisms -LRB- pointing in the direction of the right adjoint -RRB- . note that <m> S p a c e s </m> is terminal in <m> T o p o i </m> . let <m> S p ( T o p o i ) </m> be the stabilization of this category : an object is a sequence <m> ( E _ n ) _ { n \in \mathbb Z } </m> of pointed <m> \infty </m> - toposes equipped with equivalences <m> E _ n = \Omega E _ { n + 1 } </m> where <m> \Omega </m> is the loops functor on the category <m> T o p o i _ \ast </m> of pointed toposes . the question is question : are there examples of objects of <m> S p ( T o p o i ) </m> other than the `` discrete '' ones referred to above ? as alluded to above , i think there is a major restriction on the possibilities : the <m> \Omega </m> functor on pointed <m> \infty </m> - categories lands in spaces . because the `` presheaves '' functor preserves limits , the <m> \Omega </m> functor on presheaf toposes lands in slices of <m> S p a c e s </m> . since every <m> \infty </m> - topos embeds in a presheaf topos and embeddings are stable under finite limits , this implies that if <m> ( E _ n ) _ n </m> is a topos spectrum , then each <m> E _ n </m> embeds in -LRB- i.e. is a localization of -RRB- a slice of <m> S p a c e s </m> . i think this sounds pretty restrictive -- i do n't know an example of a topos that embeds into a slice of <m> S p a c e s </m> which is not itself a slice of <m> S p a c e s </m> !
let <m> M </m> be a semi-finite von neumann algebra with a trace <m> \tau </m> . let <m> S ( M ) </m> be the algebra of all affiliated operators measurable with respect to <m> M </m> . the <m> L ^ p </m> norm on <m> M </m> is given by <m> \| a \| ^ p _ { L ^ p ( M ) } = \tau ( | a | ^ p ) , \quad a \in S ( M ) . </m> now , there is a notion of the generalised singular values for <m> a \in S ( M ) </m> <m> \mu _ t ( a ) = \inf \{ s \geq 0 \colon \tau ( E _ { ( s , + \infty ) } ( | A | ) \leq t \} , </m> where <m> E _ { ( s , + \infty ) } ( | A | ) </m> is the spectral projection of the modulus of <m> A </m> . it has been shown in f. thierry and h. kosaki . generalized s-numbers of τ-measurable operators . pacific j. math. , 123 -LRB- 2 -RRB- : 269 -- 300 , 1986 . corollary 2.8 <m> \| a \| _ { L ^ p ( M ) } = \left ( \tau ( | a | ^ p \right ) ^ { \frac 1 p } = \, \left ( \int \limits ^ { + \infty } _ 0 \mu _ t ( a ) ^ p \, d t \right ) ^ { \frac 1 p } \quad 0 < p < + \infty . </m> now , we are almost ready to formulate the question . let <m> M </m> be an arbitrary von neumann algebra with a normal faithful weight <m> \varphi _ 0 </m> . let <m> L ^ 1 ( M ) </m> be the haagerup <m> L ^ 1 </m> - space . to the best of my understanding , <m> L ^ 1 ( M ) </m> is the space of all operators <m> a </m> which are radon-nykodime derivative of a weight <m> \varphi </m> with respect to a chosen and fixed weight <m> \varphi _ 0 </m> . then its <m> L ^ 1 </m> - norm <m> \| a \| _ { L ^ 1 ( M ) } = \varphi ( 1 ) </m> . now , regarding the <m> \mu _ t ( a ) </m> for an operator <m> a </m> from general von neumann algebra . the cross-product <m> R ( M , \sigma ^ { \varphi _ 0 } ) </m> of <m> M </m> with respect to the modular automorphism group <m> \sigma ^ { \varphi _ 0 } </m> has always a semi-finite trace <m> \tau </m> . then using the definition for <m> \mu _ t ( a ) </m> above it has been shown in http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022123684900557 lemma b that <m> \mu _ t ( a ) = \frac 1 { t } \| a \| _ { L ^ 1 ( M ) } , </m> here <m> \mu _ t ( a ) </m> is computed with respect to the trace on <m> R ( M , \sigma ^ { \varphi _ 0 } ) </m> . then one should get <m> \| a \| _ { L ^ 1 ( M ) } = \int \limits ^ { + \infty } _ 0 \mu _ t ( a ) d t = \| a \| _ { L ^ 1 ( M ) } \int \limits ^ { + \infty } _ 0 \frac { d t } { t } . </m> since the integral is divergent , we get absurd . i have to be wrong somewhere . could anyone help me understand my mistake ? i might suggest that the different traces are used . thanks a lot .
for sake of simplicity , let 's say that we live in <m> G = S L ( 2 , \mathbb { C } ) </m> . every conjugacy class of diagonalizable matrices <m> [ A ] : = \{ g A g ^ { - 1 } \mid g \in G \} </m> can be identified with its set of eigenvalues <m> \{ \lambda , \lambda ^ { - 1 } \} </m> . as such , the collection of diagonalizable matrices in <m> S L ( 2 , \mathbb { C } ) </m> can be identified with <m> \mathbb { C } ^ \times / \{ z \sim z ^ { - 1 } \} </m> . how about the conjugacy class of pair of matrices <m> [ A , B ] = \{ ( g A g ^ { - 1 } , g B g ^ { - 1 } ) \mid g \in G \} ? </m> can they similarly be identified with their eigenvalues in a natural way ? what is the significance of this identification ?
suppose v is a model of godel-berney 's set theory with the axiom of choice . a well-known result of kunen says that there can be no elementary embedding <m> V </m> to itself . this result further implies that there can be embedding from <m> V </m> to <m> V </m> which is <m> \Sigma _ 1 </m> - elementary . is it consistent -LRB- with say godel-berney 's set theory with the axiom of choice -RRB- that there is a <m> \Delta _ 1 </m> - elementary embedding from <m> V </m> to <m> V </m> ? how about a <m> \Delta _ 0 </m> - elementary embedding ?
let <m> ( X , * ) </m> be pointed a -LRB- 1-connected -RRB- space , and let <m> \Omega X </m> denote its based loops space . then , as one knows very well , <m> \Omega X </m> is a group up to homotopy -LRB- this includes all the necessary higher homotopies -RRB- . let <m> Y </m> be a <m> \Omega X </m> - space , i.e. a space , on which <m> \Omega X </m> acts from the left so that all the usual associativity conditions hold -LRB- up to all the necessary higher homotopies -RRB- . i wonder , if anybody knows , whether there exists a theory of <m> \Omega X </m> - equivariant cohomologies of such <m> Y </m> ? if yes , can you give me a reference ? in particular , i am interested in the values of such an equivariant cohomology in case , when <m> X </m> is a smooth manifold , <m> Y </m> is equal to the fibre of a smooth bundle over <m> X </m> , and the action of <m> \Omega X </m> on <m> Y </m> is determined by a connection on <m> X </m> .
let <m> K </m> be a field , let <m> L </m> be a field containing <m> K </m> , and let <m> G </m> be a reductive group over <m> K </m> . does there always exist a torus <m> T </m> of <m> G </m> so that <m> T _ { / L } </m> is a maximal split torus of <m> G _ { / L } </m> ? if such a torus does not exist in general , are there assumptions on <m> K </m> and <m> L </m> that guarantee that such a torus does exist -LRB- aside from the well-known case of <m> L </m> algebraically closed -RRB- ?
i 'm trying to understand why on earth the first chern class of a line bundle in k-theory <m> c _ 1 ( L ) = 1 - L </m> . i understand that the first chern class of the trivial bundle is zero , and that <m> H - 1 </m> generates the reduced k-theory of <m> C P ^ 1 </m> -LRB- where h is the canonical line bundle over <m> C P ^ 1 </m> -RRB- , but there must be more reasoning behind this ! additionally , i have seen <m> c _ 1 ( L ) </m> as both <m> L - 1 </m> and <m> 1 - L </m> , and i 'm curious if this has to do with choosing the universal line bundle to be <m> \mathcal { O } ( 1 ) </m> or <m> \mathcal { O } ( - 1 ) </m> , respectively .

for proving another interesting question : tauberian theorem <m> \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { \infty } e ^ { - \lambda _ { k } t } c _ { k } \xrightarrow { t \to 0 } \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { \infty } c _ { k } </m> i need the following inequality for dirichlet eigenvalues <m> \lambda _ { k } </m> in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } </m> for large enough k : <m> \frac { 4 \pi } { | D | } k < \lambda _ { k } < \frac { 4 \pi } { | D | } k + c \sqrt { k } . </m> for all k the lower bound is called polya 's conjecture and we only have <m> \frac { 2 \pi } { | D | } k < \lambda _ { k } </m> so far . however , since <m> \lambda _ { k } - c \sqrt { k } \approx \sqrt { k } </m> it seems reasonable that for large k , we can fit a larger lower bound <m> \frac { 4 \pi } { | D | } k < \lambda _ { k } </m> . any hints -LRB- eg . looking some part of li-yau 's proof -RRB- will be appreciated .
let <m> G </m> be a finite group and <m> M </m> a finitely generated <m> \mathbb { Z } G </m> - module . then <m> M \otimes k </m> is a representation of <m> G </m> for any field <m> k </m> . i am interested in the number of ways we can turn <m> M \otimes k </m> into a -LRB- non associative -RRB- <m> k G </m> - algebra . equivalently , i would like to compute <m> \operatorname { H o m } _ { k G } ( M \otimes M \otimes k , M \otimes k ) </m> . suppose that we know that <m> M \otimes \mathbb { C } </m> is irreducible and that <m> M \otimes M \otimes \mathbb { C } </m> contains a unique composition factor isomorphic to <m> M \otimes \mathbb { C } </m> . then we know , by schur 's lemma , that <m> \operatorname { H o m } _ { \mathbb { C } G } ( M \otimes M \otimes \mathbb { C } , M \otimes \mathbb { C } ) \cong \mathbb { C } </m> . what can we say about <m> \operatorname { H o m } _ { k G } ( M \otimes M \otimes k , M \otimes k ) </m> ? i have the feeling that <m> \operatorname { H o m } _ { k G } ( M \otimes M \otimes k , M \otimes k ) \cong k </m> if <m> k </m> is algebraically closed and <m> \operatorname { c h a r } ( k ) \nmid \left | G \right | </m> . is this correct and if so , why ? in the other cases , i think that a good knowledge of modular representation theory might give a sufficient answer but i am not sure where i should start looking in the literature .
by an admissable subcategory <m> A </m> in a triangulated category <m> B </m> , i mean a triangulated subcategory that has <m> A \oplus B \in A </m> , then <m> A </m> , <m> B \in A </m> , and so that there is either a right or left adjoint to the inclusion of <m> A </m> into <m> B </m> . then , if <m> X </m> is a projective variety -LRB- possibly with mild assumptions on the singularities -RRB- , is <m> D ^ b _ { p e r f } ( X ) </m> admissible in <m> D ^ b ( X ) </m> ? it clearly has the first condition , so i am curious about if an adjoint can be constructed . i would like to know what is the best perfect approximation to a given complex . given a module , we can write <m> 0 \to T o r ( M ) \to M \to M / T o r ( M ) \to 0 </m> . for some rings -LRB- e.g. <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> -RRB- , this is good enough , i think . but i do n't know if there is or is n't something smarter one can do that works on any variety . follow up question : if so , then what is the -LRB- left or right -RRB- orthogonal to <m> D ^ b _ { p e r f } ( X ) </m> in <m> D ^ b ( X ) </m> ? i am trying to understand if <m> D ^ b ( X ) </m> can be understood in general as a decomposition of some category of well behaved objects -LRB- perfect complexes -RRB- , and some other category . what is that other category ? something torsion something ?
the homology algebra <m> H _ * ( K ( \mathbb { Z } , 2 n ) ; \mathbb { Z } ) </m> contains a divided polynomial algebra on a generator <m> x </m> of dimension <m> 2 n </m> . i suppose i could read through the cartan seminar for a proof , but i 'm hoping someone knows of a nice simple argument for this fact .
in preparing some practice problems for my complex analysis students , i stumbled across the following . it is not hard to show , using liouville 's theorem , that <m> \pi \cot ( \pi z ) = \frac { 1 } { z } + \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \left ( \frac { 1 } { z + n } + \frac { 1 } { z - n } \right ) , </m> which implies that <m> - \frac { \pi z } { 2 } \cot ( \pi z ) = - \frac { 1 } { 2 } + \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ \infty \zeta ( 2 k ) z ^ { 2 k } , \qquad 0 < | z | < 1 . </m> this formula predicts correctly that <m> \zeta ( 0 ) = - \frac { 1 } { 2 } </m> , and allows to calculate <m> \zeta ( 2 k ) </m> as a rational multiple of <m> \pi ^ { 2 k } </m> as well -LRB- in terms of bernoulli numbers -RRB- . is there some simple explanation why the above prediction <m> \zeta ( 0 ) = - \frac { 1 } { 2 } </m> is valid ? perhaps there is a not so simple but still transparent explanation via eisenstein series . added . just to clarify what i mean by `` simple explanation '' . the second identity above follows directly from the first identity , i.e. from basic principles of complex analysis : <m> - \frac { \pi z } { 2 } \cot ( \pi z ) = - \frac { 1 } { 2 } + \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { z ^ 2 } { n ^ 2 - z ^ 2 } = - \frac { 1 } { 2 } + \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ \infty \left ( \frac { z ^ 2 } { n ^ 2 } \right ) ^ k = - \frac { 1 } { 2 } + \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ \infty \zeta ( 2 k ) z ^ { 2 k } . </m> i would like to see a similar argument , perhaps somewhat more elaborate , that explains why the constant term here happens to be <m> \zeta ( 0 ) </m> , which seems natural in the light of the other terms .

the stone -- Čech compactification of <m> \mathbb { N } </m> as a discrete space has been extensively studied and can be represented using ultrafilters . consider <m> X = ( \mathbb { Z } , \mathcal { T } ) </m> , where <m> \mathcal { T } </m> is the fürstenberg topology generated by arithmetic sequences . equipped with this exotic topology , <m> X </m> is a topological ring , metrizable , and totally disconnected . since <m> X </m> is metrizable , it is tychonoff and the map from <m> X </m> to its image in <m> \beta X </m> -LRB- its compactification -RRB- is a homeomorphism . has <m> \beta X </m> been studied ? is there a straightforward description analogous to the compactification of <m> \mathbb { N } </m> with the discrete topology ?
the irreducible but solvable octic , <m> x ^ 8 - x ^ 7 + 2 9 x ^ 2 + 2 9 = 0 \tag { 1 } </m> was first mentioned by igor schein in this 1999 sci.math post . this does not factor over a quadratic or quartic extension , but over a 7th deg one . it can also be nicely solved using the <m> 2 9 t h </m> root of unity . let <m> \omega = \exp ( 2 \pi i / 2 9 ) </m> then define , <m> y = y _ k = \omega ^ { k } + \omega ^ { 1 2 k } + \omega ^ { 1 7 k } + \omega ^ { 2 8 k } \tag { 2 } </m> <m> z _ k = 4 ( y ^ 3 + y ^ 2 - 9 y - 4 ) ( y ^ 2 - 2 ) ( y - 1 ) + 9 \tag { 3 } </m> then i found a pair of roots of <m> ( 1 ) </m> as , <m> x = \frac { 1 \color { red } { - } \sqrt { z _ { 1 } } + \sqrt { z _ { 2 } } + \sqrt { z _ { 4 } } + \sqrt { z _ { 8 } } + \sqrt { z _ { 1 6 } } + \sqrt { z _ { 3 2 } } + \sqrt { z _ { 6 4 } } } { 8 } \approx 1 . 7 9 1 0 6 + 0 . 8 2 8 6 \, i \dots </m> <m> x = \frac { 1 + \sqrt { z _ { 1 } } \color { red } { - } \sqrt { z _ { 2 } } \color { red } { - } \sqrt { z _ { 4 } } + \sqrt { z _ { 8 } } + \sqrt { z _ { 1 6 } } \color { red } { - } \sqrt { z _ { 3 2 } } + \sqrt { z _ { 6 4 } } } { 8 } \approx 1 . 7 9 1 0 6 - 0 . 8 2 8 6 \, i \dots </m> and the other pairs using appropriate signs of the square roots . note : of course , <m> y _ k </m> and <m> z _ k </m> are roots of two different 7th-deg eqns with integer coefficients , while <m> ( 3 ) </m> is the 6th-deg tschirnhausen transformation between them . -LRB- in an earlier edit , i used an alternative expression for <m> z _ k </m> by p. montgomery found in the sci.math link , but i like this one better . -RRB- question : does anyone know why <m> ( 1 ) </m> has such a simple form , and if we can find other similar irreducible but solvable octics involving a <m> p </m> th root of unity for other prime <m> p </m> ? -LRB- for some reason , this does not appear in the kluener 's database of number fields for 8t25 . -RRB-
i have an lfsr , essentially <m> x ^ k \bmod p ( x ) </m> for some characteristic primitive polynomial of degree <m> N </m> with coefficients in <m> G F ( 2 ) </m> , as outlined in clark and weng 's article : it has a period <m> 2 ^ N - 1 </m> -LRB- = order of the associated finite field -RRB- that is a `` smooth '' integer -LRB- prime factors are small -RRB- , e.g. <m> N = 4 8 </m> -LRB- largest factor of 673 -RRB- or <m> N = 6 0 </m> -LRB- largest factor of 1321 -RRB- . i know how to compute discrete logarithms using silver-pohlig-hellmann given a completely determined polynomial , so if you told me , hey you ! i have <m> x ^ { 2 3 } + x ^ { 1 6 } + x ^ { 1 4 } + 1 \equiv x ^ k \pmod { p ( x ) } </m> so what 's <m> k </m> ? then i could tell you by following the algorithm . but what if i do n't know all of the coefficients , e.g. all i know is <m> a _ { 3 1 } x ^ { 3 1 } + a _ { 3 0 } x ^ { 3 0 } + a _ { 2 9 } x ^ { 2 9 } + x ^ { 2 3 } + a _ { 2 0 } x ^ { 2 0 } + x ^ { 1 6 } + x ^ { 1 4 } + a _ 2 x ^ 2 + 1 \equiv x ^ k \pmod { p ( x ) } </m> and i do n't know the five unknown <m> a _ j </m> 's -LRB- so <m> k </m> has <m> 2 ^ 5 = 3 2 </m> principal solutions -RRB- . aside from running through each of the possibilities , is there a way to figure out <m> k </m> from one of them -LRB- e.g. set the unknown <m> a _ j </m> to zero , then take discrete logarithm -RRB- , and then determine the rest ?
how to construct the homeomorphism between <m> C [ 0 , 1 ] </m> and <m> C [ 0 , 1 ] \setminus \{ \theta \} </m> in the explicit form ? here , as usual , <m> C [ 0 , 1 ] </m> is the banach space of continuous functions <m> f : [ 0 , 1 ] \to \mathbb { R } </m> with the norm <m> \| f \| = \max \limits _ { x \in [ 0 , 1 ] } | f ( x ) | ; </m> and <m> \theta ( x ) \equiv 0 </m> <m> \forall x \in [ 0 , 1 ] </m> .

the usual fubini 's theorem -LRB- see the wikipedia article for example -RRB- assumes completeness or <m> \sigma </m> - finiteness on measures . however , i think i came up with a proof of the fubini 's theorem without those assumptions . am i mistaken ? i restate the theorem to avoid confusion : if a function is integrable on a product measure space , its integral can be calculated by iterated integrals . the idea of my proof is to use a fact that if a function is integrable on a product measure space , the function must be zero outside a <m> \sigma </m> - finite subset of the product measure space .
let <m> X </m> be the following vector field on <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 2 \setminus \{ 0 \} </m> <m>  </m> it is well known that there is no a riemannian metric on the punctured plane such that the orbits of the above vector field would be unparametrized geodesics . the proof is based on existence of opposite orientation of two consecutive nested limit cycles in the phase portrait of the vector field . now we reduce the above geodesibility requirement to the following question ; -LRB- is this an obvious reduced question -RRB- ?
i have been looking at this for days and i am going insane . i need to show that for a dirichlet series equal to <m> \zeta ( s ) \zeta ( 2 s ) </m> , the sum of the coefficients less than <m> x </m> is <m> x \zeta ( 2 ) + O ( x ^ { ( 3 / 4 ) } ) </m> , and then expand that to the <m> \Pi \zeta ( k s ) </m> for all <m> k </m> in an effort to find the formula for the number of non-isomorphic abelian groups . i know that using perron 's formula there is a simple pole at <m> s = 1 </m> that gives a residue of <m> X \zeta ( 2 ) </m> , but i ca n't find a contour that converges or the exact error term .
is there a natural example of a discrete subgroup <m> \Gamma \leq P S L _ 2 ( \mathbf { R } ) </m> such that -LRB- 1 -RRB- <m> \Gamma </m> has finite covolume -LRB- 2 -RRB- <m> \mathfrak { h } / \Gamma </m> is not compact -LRB- <m> \mathfrak { h } </m> being the upper half-plane -RRB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- <m> \Gamma </m> is not commensurable to a conjugate of <m> P S L _ 2 ( \mathbf { Z } ) </m> . i can not think of any such example but i do n't see any reason why they should not exist .
is there an operator <m> T : X \rightarrow Y </m> that factors through a banach space <m> Z </m> containing no complemented copy of <m> l _ { 1 } </m> , but does not factor through any banach space <m> W </m> containg no copy of <m> l _ { 1 } </m> ?
this is an immediate successor of chebyshev polynomials of the first kind and primality testing and does not have any other motivation - although original motivation seems to be huge since a positive answer -LRB- if not too complicated -RRB- would give a very efficient primality test -LRB- see the linked question for details -RRB- . recall that the chebyshev polynomials <m> T _ n ( x ) </m> are defined by <m> T _ 0 ( x ) = 1 </m> , <m> T _ 1 ( x ) = x </m> and <m> T _ { n + 1 } ( x ) = 2 x T _ n ( x ) - T _ { n - 1 } ( x ) </m> , and there are several explicit expressions for their coefficients . rather than writing them down -LRB- you can find them at the wikipedia link anyway -RRB- , let me just give a couple of examples : <m> T _ { 1 5 } ( x ) = - 1 5 x ( 1 - 4 \frac { 7 \cdot 8 } { 2 \cdot 3 } x ^ 2 + 4 ^ 2 \frac { 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 \cdot 9 } { 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 } x ^ 4 - 4 ^ 3 \frac { 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 1 0 } { 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 } x ^ 6 + 4 ^ 4 \frac { 1 0 \cdot 1 1 } { 2 \cdot 3 } x ^ 8 - 4 ^ 5 \frac { 1 2 } { 2 } x ^ { 1 0 } + 4 ^ 6 x ^ { 1 2 } ) + 4 ^ 7 x ^ { 1 5 } </m> <m> T _ { 1 7 } ( x ) = 1 7 x ( 1 - 4 \frac { 8 \cdot 9 } { 2 \cdot 3 } x ^ 2 + 4 ^ 2 \frac { 7 \cdot 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 1 0 } { 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 } x ^ 4 - 4 ^ 3 \frac { 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 1 0 \cdot 1 1 } { 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 } x ^ 6 + 4 ^ 4 \frac { 1 0 \cdot 1 1 \cdot 1 2 } { 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 } x ^ 8 - 4 ^ 5 \frac { 1 2 \cdot 1 3 } { 2 \cdot 3 } x ^ { 1 0 } + 4 ^ 6 \frac { 1 4 } { 2 } x ^ { 1 2 } - 4 ^ 7 x ^ { 1 4 } ) + 4 ^ 8 x ^ { 1 7 } </m> it seems that <m> n </m> is a prime if and only if all the ratios in the parentheses are integers ; this is most likely well known and easy to show . the algorithm described in the above question requires determining whether , for an odd <m> n </m> , coefficients of the remainder from dividing <m> T _ n ( x ) - x ^ n </m> by <m> x ^ r - 1 </m> , for some fairly small prime <m> r </m> -LRB- roughly <m> \sim \log n </m> -RRB- are all divisible by <m> n </m> . in other words , denoting by <m> a _ j </m> , <m> j = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . </m> the coefficients of <m> T _ n ( x ) - x ^ n </m> , we have to find out whether the sum <m> s _ j : = a _ j + a _ { j + r } + a _ { j + 2 r } + . . . </m> is divisible by <m> n </m> for each <m> j = 0 , 1 , . . . , r - 1 </m> . the question then is : given <m> r </m> and <m> n </m> as above -LRB- <m> n </m> odd , <m> r </m> a prime much smaller than <m> n </m> -RRB- , is there an efficient method to find these sums <m> s _ j </m> without calculating all <m> a _ j </m> ? i. e. , can one compute <m> T _ n ( x ) </m> modulo <m> x ^ r - 1 </m> -LRB- i. e. in a ring where <m> x ^ r = 1 </m> -RRB- essentially easier than first computing the whole <m> T _ n ( x ) </m> and then dividing by <m> x ^ r - 1 </m> in the ring of polynomials ? -LRB- as already said , only the question of divisibility of the result by <m> n </m> is required ; also <m> r </m> is explicitly given -LRB- it is the smallest prime with <m> n </m> not <m> \pm 1 </m> modulo <m> r </m> -RRB- . this might be easier to answer than computing the whole polynomials mod <m> x ^ r - 1 </m> . -RRB-
this might be well known for algebraic topologist . so i am looking for an explicit example of a 4 dimensional manifold with fundamental group isomorphic to the rationals <m> \mathbb Q </m> .
in this question which i flag it as a community wiki , i search for a big list of <m> C ^ { * } </m> algebras -LRB- and a big list of criterions -RRB- which do not admit a non trivial idempotent <m> C ^ { * } - </m> morphism . i know 2 cases : simple <m> C ^ { * } </m> algebras , <m> B ( H ) </m> , where <m> H </m> is a separable hilbert space .
the purpose of this question is to collect sufficient conditions on a unital <m> \ast </m> - subalgebra <m> \mathcal { A } </m> of the algebra of bounded linear operators <m> B ( \mathcal { H } ) </m> on a separable hilbert space <m> \mathcal { H } </m> that guarantee that <m> \mathcal { A } </m> is actually a <m> C ^ { * } </m> algebra -LRB- is closed in the operator norm -RRB- . please provide links and references . at least , i 'd like a reference or proof for the following : `` thm : '' if <m> \mathcal { A } </m> is a unital <m> \ast </m> - subalgebra of <m> B ( \mathcal { H } ) </m> and whenever <m> A \in \mathcal { A } </m> is self-adjoint it follows that <m> A _ { + } </m> and <m> A _ { - } </m> both lie in <m> \mathcal { A } </m> , then <m> \mathcal { A } </m> is norm-closed . -LRB- here , <m> A _ { + } </m> and <m> A _ { - } </m> live naturally in the <m> C ^ { * } </m> - algebra generated by <m> A </m> and <m> I </m> , isomorphic to <m> C ( \sigma ( A ) ) ) </m> , where <m> A </m> corresponds to the function <m> f ( x ) = x </m> , <m> A _ { + } </m> corresponds to <m> m a x [ f , 0 \] </m> and <m> A _ { - } </m> to <m> m i n [ f , 0 ] </m> . -RRB- -LRB- edit : nik has pointed out that the `` thm '' is false . the broader question stands : is there any other interesting abstract characterization of a c * - algebra that does n't obviously say the algebra is norm-closed ? -RRB-
consider a surface of revolution of positive curvature . my question is , what are the surfaces -LRB- with boundary -RRB- in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 3 </m> which are isotopic to the surface of revolution , provided each member of the family is positively curved ? i am trying to see if we can achieve any positively curved surface -LRB- with boundary -RRB- diffeomorphic to the surface of revolution -LRB- i guess we have to include the restriction that the boundaries of such surfaces will be `` unknots '' to remove the obvious obstruction -RRB- .
this is not a homework problem , although i fear it may turn out to be at that level . for any nonnegative <m> x \in \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> , let <m> f _ k ( x ) </m> be the sum of the <m> k </m> largest values in <m> x </m> , and define <m> f ( x ) = \max _ { k } \frac { f _ k ( x ) } { \sqrt { k } } </m> over all <m> k \in \{ 1 , \dots , n \} </m> . it is easy to see that <m> f ( x ) \leq \| x \| _ 2 </m> for all nonnegative <m> x </m> . is the ratio <m> \| x \| _ 2 / f ( x ) </m> bounded from above ?
endow <m> S ^ 7 </m> with a structure of an <m> H </m> - space induced from multiplication in octonions <m> \mathbb { O } = \mathbb { R } ^ 8 </m> . it is not associative as octonion multiplication is not associative . is it associative up to homotopy , i.e. are maps <m> m ( m ( - , - ) , - ) : S ^ 7 \times S ^ 7 \times S ^ 7 \to S ^ 7 </m> and <m> m ( - , m ( - , - ) ) : S ^ 7 \times S ^ 7 \times S ^ 7 \to S ^ 7 </m> homotopic ?
let <m> f ( t ) </m> be a monic real polynomial such that <m> f ( t ) > 0 </m> for all <m> t \ge 0 </m> . suppose that <m> \log f ( e ^ x ) </m> is strictly convex on <m> \mathbb { R } </m> , i.e. <m> f ( s ^ 2 ) \cdot f ( t ^ 2 ) > f ( s t ) ^ 2 </m> for all <m> s , t \ge 0 </m> . can one show that in fact <m> \frac { d ^ 2 } { d x ^ 2 } ( \log f ( e ^ x ) ) > 0 </m> for all <m> x \in \mathbb { R } </m> ? remark : since <m> \log f ( e ^ x ) </m> is strictly convex -LRB- and hence convex -RRB- , we always have <m> \frac { d ^ 2 } { d x ^ 2 } ( \log f ( e ^ x ) ) \ge 0 </m> . -LRB- this question is migrated from math stack exchange , where it has not received a response . -RRB-

which cardinals <m> \lambda > 2 </m> have the following property ? there is a space <m> ( X , \tau ) </m> such that
let <m> f : \{ - 1 , 1 \} ^ n \rightarrow \{ - 1 , 1 \} </m> be a boolean function which is of degree at most <m> d </m> when expressed as a multilinear polynomial -LRB- <m> f ( x ) = \sum _ S \hat { f } ( S ) \prod _ { i \in S } x _ i </m> -RRB- . it is known that such a function is a <m> d 2 ^ { d - 1 } </m> - junta - i.e. <m> f </m> depends on at most <m> d 2 ^ { d - 1 } </m> variables . in fact , this should hold for any range of size <m> 2 </m> . suppose the range of <m> f </m> consisted of <m> m </m> real numbers and <m> f </m> were still of degree <m> d </m> . is it known whether <m> f </m> is a <m> g _ m ( d ) </m> - junta for some function <m> g _ m ( d ) < < n </m> ?
this question can be formulated for general -LRB- <m> \sigma </m> - finite -RRB- von neumann algebras , but for me it is enough to consider matrix algebras . so let <m> M </m> be a matrix algebra and <m> \rho </m> a faithful state -LRB- density operator -RRB- on <m> M </m> . for <m> 1 \le p < \infty </m> , we define the <m> L _ p </m> - norm on <m> M </m> with respect to <m> \rho </m> as <m> \| a \| _ { p , \rho } ^ p = T r ( \rho ^ { 1 / 2 p } a \rho ^ { 1 / 2 p } ) ^ p . </m> let us also introduce the inner product <m> \langle a , b \rangle _ \rho = T r a ^ * \rho ^ { 1 / 2 } b \rho ^ { 1 / 2 } </m> , for <m> a , b \in M </m> , then <m> L _ p </m> and <m> L _ q </m> are dual with respect to <m> \langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle _ \rho </m> for <m> 1 / p + 1 / q = 1 </m> . let <m> N </m> be another matrix algebra and <m> \phi : N \to M </m> be a unital completely positive -LRB- ucp -RRB- map , such that the state <m> \rho _ 0 = \phi ^ * ( \rho ) </m> , given by <m> T r ( \rho _ 0 a ) = T r ( \rho \phi ( a ) ) , \ a \in N </m> is faithful . then <m> \phi </m> is a contraction with respect to the <m> L _ p </m> - norms , <m> \| \phi ( a ) \| _ { p , \rho } \le \| a \| _ { p , \phi ^ * ( \rho ) } , \ a \in N . </m> i am interested in a characterization of the set of elements where equality is attained in the above inequality . namely , let <m> 1 < p < \infty </m> and let <m> \mathcal I _ p : = \{ a \in N , \| \phi ( a ) \| _ { p , \rho } = \| a \| _ { p , \phi ^ * ( \rho ) } \} </m> for <m> p = 2 </m> , this set can be determined easily . in this case , <m> M </m> with the <m> L _ 2 </m> - norm is a hilbert space with the inner product <m> \langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle _ \rho </m> and <m> \mathcal I _ 2 </m> is equal to the set <m> \mathcal F </m> of fixed points of the map <m> \phi _ \rho ^ * \circ \phi </m> , where <m> \phi ^ * _ \rho </m> is the adjoint of <m> \phi </m> with respect to this inner product . it is easy to see that <m> \phi ^ * _ \rho </m> is an ucp map <m> M \to N </m> , so that <m> \phi ^ * _ \rho \circ \phi </m> is an ucp map on <m> N </m> that preserves the faithful state <m> \rho _ 0 </m> . consequently , <m> \mathcal F </m> is a subalgebra invariant under the modular group <m> \sigma ^ { \rho _ 0 } </m> of <m> \rho _ 0 </m> . for <m> p \ne 2 </m> , the inclusion <m> \mathcal F \subseteq \mathcal I _ p </m> is easily obtained by the fact that <m> \phi ^ * _ \rho </m> is an ucp map and therefore also a contraction . so my questions are :
a link between formal series convergence in deformation quantization -LRB- strict deformation quantization -RRB- and producing <m> C ^ * </m> - algebras instead of mere <m> * </m> - algebras -LRB- which <m> ( \mathcal { C } ^ { \infty } ( M ) [ [ t ] ] , \star ) </m> is -RRB- after deforming the initial commutative <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra of observables is evoked here : http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/c-star+algebraic+deformation+quantization however this is done very briefly and in the language of higher symplectic geometry which i 'm not familiar with . can anyone give simpler explanations and arguments/theorems justifying the link between convergence and the <m> C ^ * </m> - condition ? or some reference for an introduction ?
consider the function <m> h : [ 0 , 1 ] \to \mathbb { R } </m> <m> h ( \theta ) : = \sum _ { k \geq 1 } \frac { a _ { k } } { \sqrt { k } } \cos ( 2 \pi k \theta ) + \frac { b _ { k } } { \sqrt { k } } \sin ( 2 \pi k \theta ) , </m> where <m> a _ { k } , b _ { k } \in \mathbb { R } </m> . for simplicity let 's take <m> \big ( \frac { a _ { k } } { \sqrt { k } } \big ) , \big ( \frac { b _ { k } } { \sqrt { k } } \big ) \in \ell ^ { 1 } </m> , so that <m> h \in H ^ { 1 } ( S ^ { 1 } ) </m> . the ode we have is <m> y ' = \exp ( - h ( y ) ) \; \Leftrightarrow \; y ( x ) = \int _ { 0 } ^ { x } \exp ( - h ( y ( t ) ) ) d t . </m> does this fit anywhere into the ode theory -LRB- e.g. fixed points of integral equations -RRB- ? maybe the simpler problem with a truncated series <m> y ' = \exp ( - h ^ { N } ( y ) ) , </m> where <m> h ^ { N } ( \theta ) = \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { N } \frac { a _ { k } } { \sqrt { k } } \cos ( 2 \pi k \theta ) + \frac { b _ { k } } { \sqrt { k } } \sin ( 2 \pi k \theta ) </m> . or even simpler with a single term : <m> y ' = \exp \Big ( - \big ( \frac { a _ { k } } { \sqrt { k } } \cos ( 2 \pi k y ) + \frac { b _ { k } } { \sqrt { k } } \sin ( 2 \pi k y ) \big ) \Big ) . </m> or even more simply <m> y ' = \exp ( - ( \cos ( 2 \pi y ) ) . </m> our main question is to obtain a -LRB- series -RRB- approximation solution to <m> y </m> -LRB- for any of the above odes -RRB- ?
i have a <m> Z ^ 2 </m> lattice . every element <m> ( z _ 1 , z _ 2 ) \in Z ^ 2 </m> is connected to one of its 4 neighbours <m> ( z _ 1 , z _ 2 ) + ( 0 , 1 ) </m> , <m> ( z _ 1 , z _ 2 ) + ( 0 , - 1 ) </m> , <m> ( z _ 1 , z _ 2 ) + ( 1 , 0 ) </m> , <m> ( z _ 1 , z _ 2 ) + ( - 1 , 0 ) </m> by an edge . the edges can be `` open '' with a probability <m> p </m> and `` closed '' with a probability 1-p . i call <m> \sigma _ n </m> the total number of self avoinding walks starting from <m> ( 0 , 0 ) </m> and composed of <m> n </m> steps through the edges . then i define the event -LCB- <m> N _ n = k </m> -RCB- = -LCB- `` the number of saw composed of n open steps is k '' -RCB- . my question is : is it correct writing that the probability of this event is the following ? <m> P ( N _ n = k ) = \binom { \sigma _ n } { k } ( p ^ n ) ^ k ( 1 - p ^ n ) ^ { \sigma _ n - k } . </m> this would mean that the events -LCB- `` this saw is open '' -RCB- and -LCB- `` this other saw is open '' -RCB- are all independent one from the other , but i think it should be wrong because some saws necessarily share some edge one with the other one . but on the other hand , this is the only way i am able to justify the last equality in the following expression , which i find in many text books of percolation theory , <m> P ( N _ n \geq 1 ) = \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { \sigma _ n } P ( N _ n = k ) \leq \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { \sigma _ n } k P ( N _ n = k ) = E [ N _ n ] = p ^ n \sigma _ n . </m> where e is the expectation . could anyone help me to clarify this point ?
this is a followup to this question about the -LRB- left -RRB- noetherianity of the group ring of <m> G L _ n ( \mathbf { Z } ) </m> : does gl _ n -LRB- z -RRB- have a noetherian group ring ? given that <m> \mathbf { Z } [ G L _ n ( \mathbf { Z } ) ] </m> is not left noetherian , i want to ask if there is a relaxation . what i gather from this fact is that this ring is too large and contains information about all representations of <m> G L _ n ( \mathbf { Z } ) </m> , while maybe the right thing is to restrict to some class of `` reasonable '' representations to get more control . as an analogy , the theory of polynomial representations of <m> G L _ n ( K ) </m> for an algebraically closed field <m> K </m> is `` reasonable '' and is equivalent to the study of modules over the schur algebra . i would like to know if there are similar nice classes of representations for <m> G L _ n ( \mathbf { Z } ) </m> . one candidate is to look at polynomial representations , but i do not necessarily want to assume that the representations are compatible with base change of the ring <m> \mathbf { Z } </m> to <m> \mathbf { Q } </m> , for example , so i am looking for something else . ideally the class of representations would be equivalent to modules over some nice algebra , where nice might mean left noetherian .

partly inspired by recent developments in enumeration of pattern avoiding permutations , which is known to be connected with brownian excursions -LSB- hoffman & rizzolo -RSB- . the exciting milestone is the solution of stanley -- wilf conjecture -LRB- btw wilf is the same person in this post -RRB- in 2004 -LSB- marcus & tardos -RSB- characterizing the pattern-avoiding permutations by limiting the number of such permutations to be <m> C ^ n </m> -LRB- <m> C </m> being constant -RRB- among all permutation of length <m> n </m> in <m> \mathcal { S } _ n </m> . and fox showed that the <m> C </m> is almost surely exponential -LSB- fox -RSB- . the problem i have in mind is about random permutations acting on a fixed set <m> M </m> .
take <m> n </m> lines in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ d </m> -LRB- not necessary different , and all passing through the origin , though this is not important -RRB- . what is maximal possible sum of angles between them for given <m> n </m> and <m> d </m> ? conjecturally you should use only <m> d </m> different mutually orthogonal directions , either <m> \lfloor n / d \rfloor </m> or <m> \lceil n / d \rceil </m> times each of them . i can not prove or disprove this even for <m> d = 3 </m> . note that if you take <m> n </m> rays instead of lines then the optimal configuration contains only two opposite directions , each <m> \lfloor n / 2 \rfloor </m> or <m> \lceil n / 2 \rceil </m> times .
two questions . first , let <m> \Sigma _ 3 </m> be the closed genus 3 surface and let <m> \rm M o d ( \Sigma _ 3 ) </m> be its mapping class group . is it true that for any mapping class <m> g \in \rm M o d ( \Sigma _ 3 ) </m> there is some hyperelliptic involution of <m> \Sigma _ 3 </m> which it commutes with ? by hyperelliptic involution , i mean a mapping class with an order two representative <m> f </m> with <m> 8 </m> fixed points . also , another question , are there any results on choosing representatives for each coset of <m> \rm H M o d ( \Sigma _ 3 ) </m> , the hyperelliptic mapping class group ? thank you for any help .
let <m> A </m> be a von neumann algebra acting on a hilbert space <m> H </m> . write <m> \mathcal { B } ( H ) </m> for the bounded linear operators on <m> H </m> . suppose that <m> \rho : \mathcal { B } ( H ) \rightarrow \mathcal { B } ( H ) </m> is an inner automorphism of <m> \mathcal { B } ( H ) </m> , that is <m> \rho ( x ) = u x u ^ { * } </m> for some unitary operator <m> u </m> on <m> H </m> . suppose furthermore that <m> \rho </m> leaves <m> A </m> invariant , that is <m> \rho ( A ) = A </m> .
please forgive me if this is a very easy question . let <m> A \subset [ 0 , 1 ] </m> be a borel-measurable set with strictly positive lebesgue measure . does there necessarily exist a countable subgroup <m> G </m> of <m> \mathbb { R } </m> such that the set <m> \{ t \in [ 0 , 1 ] : ( t + G ) \cap A \neq \emptyset \} </m> has lebesgue measure 1 ?
i should preface this by saying that i am not a representation theorist , so i apologize if this can easily be found in standard sources -LRB- but sadly i can not seem to extract it from any of the books i know of -RRB- . let <m> p </m> be a prime number . what are all the irreducible representations -LRB- over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> -RRB- of <m> \text { S L } ( n , \mathbb { F } _ p ) </m> and <m> \text { S p } ( 2 n , \mathbb { F } _ p ) </m> whose dimensions are <m> p ^ k </m> for some <m> k </m> ? there are the steinberg representations , but i assume that there are also others . i 'm particularly interested in the symplectic group .
let <m> M </m> be a path-connected finite <m> C W </m> - complex . suppose the first integral homology group is <m> H _ 1 ( M ; \mathbb { Z } ) = \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ^ { \oplus r } \oplus A </m> where <m> r \geq 1 </m> and <m> A </m> is a finite abelian group of odd order . does <m> M </m> necessarily satisfy the property -LRB- 1 -RRB- for any nonzero element <m> x \in H ^ 1 ( M ; \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) </m> , <m> x ^ 2 \neq 0 </m> ?
let <m> k </m> be a finite field , <m> T H H ( k ) </m> its topological hochschild homology spectrum . for essentially formal reasons , we know that it 's an <m> E _ \infty </m> - algebra over the eilenberg-mac lane spectrum <m> H k </m> , and so can be modeled by an <m> E _ \infty </m> - dga over <m> k </m> . question : is this <m> E _ \infty </m> - structure equivalent to a strictly commutative multiplication ? we know that the homotopy algebra <m> \pi _ * T H H ( k ) </m> is a polynomial ring on a generator in degree <m> 2 </m> , so in particular it can not be equivalent to a simplicial commutative <m> k </m> - algebra -LRB- for then it would support a divided-power structure relative to its ideal of positive-degree elements . -RRB- so in a sense a positive answer to the question above would say that <m> T H H ( k ) </m> is `` as commutative as it could possibly be '' given its homotopy algebra .
i guess the question can be asked for all manifolds . but i am particularly interested in <m> S ^ 1 \times S ^ 2 </m> right now . concrete example preferrd .
the paper : http://www.math.mcgill.ca/radziwill/cltnotes3.pdf . briefly , i 'm having trouble inferring the moments given at the end of proposition 2 from lemma 1 . i 'm going by splitting the integrands into real and imaginary parts , and then expanding into products of the real and imaginary parts of <m> \mathcal { P } _ 0 </m> itself . i run into a jungle of binomial coefficients as coefficients of <m> ( \Re \mathcal { P } _ 0 ) ^ n ( \Im \mathcal { P } _ 0 ) ^ { k - n } </m> , where i 'm trying to show that appropriate linear combinations of <m> | \mathcal { P } _ 0 | ^ n \Re ( \mathcal { P } _ 0 ^ { k - n } ) </m> give the final results . in the odd cases any combination of integrals with <m> k \neq l </m> will do , so we just need existence , while in the even case of <m> k </m> -LRB- using the <m> k </m> they have after the lemma -RRB- we need particular combinations starring <m> \mathcal { P } _ 0 ^ k </m> to give us the new coefficient in the main term . is this a good path , in which case how does one follow it ? or am i going in too messy a direction , in which case how should i really be thinking of this ?
let me quote the following theorem about the structure of <m> C ^ * ( G ) </m> for property <m> T </m> group -LRB- the reference is higson and roe `` analitycal k-homology '' -RRB- :
i wonder if there is a nice and short proof that the <m> K </m> - theory of a topological space is a special <m> \lambda </m> - ring without invoking the splitting principle and alike . is it possible to show directly that <m> \lambda ^ k ( V \otimes W ) </m> and <m> P _ k ( \lambda ^ 1 ( V ) , . . . , \lambda ^ k ( V ) , \lambda ^ 1 ( W ) , . . . , \lambda ^ k ( W ) ) </m> are stabily equivalent , without making unnatural choices ? the same question for <m> \lambda ^ i ( \lambda ^ k ( V ) ) </m> and <m> P _ { i k } ( \lambda ^ 1 ( V ) , . . . , \lambda ^ { i k } ( V ) ) </m> . it would be nice if there is some natural isomorphism on the level of vector spaces , which then may be glued to an isomorphism between vector bundles , perhaps with some extra summands on both sides which vanish in k-theory . note that an affirmative answer would , in particular , answer this question by darij grinberg . i hope that my question is clear enough although it is not precise . on the other hand , there is a precise generalization : let <m> A </m> be a topological ring , perhaps a banach algebra . is the grothendieck ring of topological <m> A </m> - module bundles over a fixed <m> X </m> a special <m> \lambda </m> - ring ?
given that many sums over the naturals -LRB- e.g. , <m> 1 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 2 + \ldots </m> -RRB- can be extended to sums over the primes using integration and the prime number theorem , it seems natural to look at sums that would be difficult to extend . the alternating sum <m> 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 \ldots </m> has an elementary sum ; so consider the corresponding sum on the primes <m> 2 - 3 + 5 - 7 + \ldots P _ n </m> . for <m> n </m> even , this is the negative of <m> ( 3 - 2 ) + ( 7 - 5 ) + ( 1 3 - 1 1 ) + \ldots </m> which is the negative of the sum of half the prime gaps between <m> 2 </m> and <m> n </m> . but the sum of all the prime gaps telescopes to <m> P _ n - 2 </m> . thus , heuristically a good estimate for the alternating sum appears to be <m> - P _ n / 2 </m> which by the prime number theorem is asymptotic to - <m> n \ln n / 2 </m> . similarly , for odd <m> n </m> , a similar estimate is <m> - P _ n / 2 + P _ n = n \ln n / 2 </m> . i coded up this estimate -LRB- actually , my code used the estimate due to dusart of <m> P _ n = n ( \ln n + \ln \ln n - 1 ) </m> -RRB- and found errors less than 2 % for <m> 5 0 0 < n < 7 8 , 4 0 1 </m> for both <m> n </m> odd and <m> n </m> even . the question remains : is there a proof that the sum is asymptotic to <m> n \ln n / 2 </m> for n odd and to <m> - n \ln n / 2 </m> for <m> n </m> even ? one of the comments refers to a limit by ruiz http://www.primepuzzles.net/puzzles/puzz_211.htm . one of the posts there suggests that the ruiz limit holds for prime powers as well . i have no idea whether the ruiz result is proved -LRB- there seems to be some doubt -RRB- but the same heuristic argument above seems to extend to alternating series on prime powers <m> 2 ^ k - 3 ^ k + 5 ^ k + . . . P _ n ^ k </m> . again , for <m> n </m> even this is the negative of the sum of the gaps <m> ( 3 ^ k - 2 ^ k ) + ( 7 ^ k - 5 ^ k ) + \ldots </m> which is half of the sum of <m> ( 3 ^ k - 2 ^ k ) + ( 5 ^ k - 3 ^ k ) + ( 7 ^ k - 5 ^ k ) + \ldots </m> which telescopes to <m> P _ n ^ k - 2 ^ k </m> . this suggests heuristically again that a good estimate for the alternating sum to power <m> k </m> is <m> - P _ n ^ k / 2 </m> for <m> n </m> even and <m> P _ n ^ k / 2 </m> for <m> n </m> odd . or in terms of <m> n </m> , <m> - ( n \ln n ) ^ k / 2 </m> for <m> n </m> even and <m> ( n \ln n ) ^ k / 2 </m> for <m> n </m> odd . the oeis has a page for <m> k = 1 </m> and some conjectures but not seemingly related to the sum . there does not seem to be an entry for <m> k = 2 </m> -LRB- the partial sums <m> 4 , - 5 , 2 0 , - 2 9 , \ldots </m> -RRB-
while teaching number theory this quarter , i have come across a phenomenon which was already addressed in another mo posting , but i have new questions . let <m> p </m> be a prime congruent to 3 mod 4 . then an elementary refinement of wilson 's theorem says that <m> \frac { p - 1 } 2 ! </m> is congruent to <m> \pm 1 </m> mod <m> p </m> . in fact , a published result of mordell says that it is congruent to <m> ( - 1 ) ^ { ( h + 1 ) / 2 } </m> , where <m> h </m> is the class number of the imaginary quadratic number field <m> \mathbb { Q } ( \sqrt { - p } ) </m> . mordell 's identity is taken to mean that -LRB- 1 -RRB- you can not expect <m> \frac { p - 1 } 2 ! \in \mathbb { Z } / p </m> to be governed by any very simple property of <m> p </m> such as a congruence , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- we can conjecture but not prove that the density of both values is <m> \frac 1 2 </m> . so i wonder about the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- what is fastest known algorithm to compute <m> \frac { p - 1 } 2 ! \in \mathbb { Z } / p </m> ? i read somewhere that you can compute <m> h </m> in time <m> O ( p ^ { 1 / 5 } ) </m> , but for this question -LRB- actually for the interest of the class -RRB- i only care about <m> h </m> mod 4 . -LRB- 2 -RRB- never mind the density , is it known that both values occur infinitely often ? -LRB- 3 -RRB- if it is known that both values occur infinitely often , then is it known , for each <m> \text { g c d } ( n , a ) = 1 </m> , that they occur infinitely often when <m> p = k n + a </m> ? -LRB- it is of course dirichlet 's theorem that there are infinitely many such primes . -RRB-
if <m> X </m> is a set of ordinals , define <m> f ( X , \alpha ) </m> such that <m> f ( X , 0 ) = X </m> , <m> f ( X , \beta + 1 ) = f ( X , \beta ) \cap L i m ( f ( X , \beta ) ) </m> , where <m> L i m ( Y ) = \{ </m> limit points of <m> Y \} </m> , and <m> f ( X , \gamma ) = \bigcap \{ f ( X , \beta ) : \beta < \gamma \} </m> for limit <m> \gamma </m> . now let <m> \kappa </m> be uncountable regular , and let <m> X \subset \kappa </m> such that for all <m> \alpha < \kappa </m> , <m> f ( X , \alpha ) </m> is unbounded in <m> \kappa </m> . can we then conclude that <m> X </m> is stationary in <m> \kappa </m> ? i feel the answer is no , but i could not come up with a counter example .
let <m> X </m> be a nonsingular algebraic variety over a field <m> k </m> of characteristic zero . -LRB- we may assume <m> k </m> algebraically closed if need be , but i want to avoid specifically demanding <m> k = \mathbb { C } </m> . -RRB- let <m> \mathcal { D } _ X </m> be the sheaf of <m> k </m> - linear differential operators on <m> X </m> , and let <m> \mathcal { M } </m> be a left <m> \mathcal { D } _ X </m> - module . since giving a left <m> \mathcal { D } _ X </m> - module structure on <m> \mathcal { M } </m> is equivalent to giving an integrable connection <m> \nabla </m> on <m> \mathcal { M } </m> , we can use <m> \nabla </m> to construct the de rham complex <m> \mathcal { M } \otimes \Omega ^ { \bullet } _ { X / k } </m> of <m> X </m> with coefficients in <m> \mathcal { M } </m> . the corresponding de rham cohomology is the hypercohomology <m> \mathbb { H } ^ { \bullet } ( X , \mathcal { M } \otimes \Omega ^ { \bullet } _ { X / k } ) </m> of this complex . this is the definition given in hartshorne 's 1975 paper `` on the de rham cohomology of algebraic varieties '' , section iii .4 . my main question is the following :
i will present my question in the context that i encountered it , although i believe it probably applies in general context . consider <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 4 \cong \mathbb { C } ^ 2 </m> with the standard symplectic form <m> \omega = \sum d p _ k \wedge d q _ k </m> . consider a lagrangian <m> L \cong S ^ 1 \times S ^ 1 </m> given by the product of two circles , <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> , each lying in an <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> factor of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 4 </m> . consider a class <m> \alpha \in \pi _ 2 ( \mathbb { R } ^ 4 , L ) </m> , such that <m> \omega ( \alpha ) > 0 </m> . 1 -RRB- does there exists an almost complex structure <m> J </m> compatible with <m> \omega _ { s t d } </m> such that <m> \alpha </m> is represented by a <m> J </m> - holomorphic disc <m> u </m> with boundary mapped to <m> L </m> ? note that for the integrable complex structure <m> J _ { s t d } </m> that comes from <m> \mathbb C </m> this is true only for <m> \alpha </m> of the form <m> k A + m B </m> , where <m> k , m \ge 0 </m> -LRB- here i abused notation and referred to the discs bounded by the circles <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> using the same letters -RRB- 2 -RRB- if the answer to 1 is positive , can <m> J </m> be chosen to be regular ? -LRB- in the sense that all the moduli spaces of curves are being cut out transversally -RRB- . thank you ! :-RRB-

let 's endow <m> \mathbb { C P } ^ { 2 } </m> with symplectic structure given by fubini-study form . then we have a class of lagrangian tori of zero mean curvature in it -LRB- minimal lagrangian tori -RRB- . is there a result asserting that clifford torus has the least area in that class ? results of haskins in `` the geometric complexity of special lagrangian t2-cones '' suggest that minimal lagrangian tori of spectral genus at least 44 have bigger area than clifford torus ; but there are also some tori with spectal genus in <m> [ 0 , 4 4 ) </m> .
let <m> G </m> be a finite abelian group -LRB- cosidered as a discrete topological group -RRB- , <m> A </m> a unital separable <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra . let <m> T \colon G \to \operatorname { A u t } ( A ) </m> , <m> T _ g ( a ) = a </m> for all <m> g \in G </m> the trivial action . let <m> L t \colon G \to \operatorname { A u t } ( C ( G ) ) </m> the left translation , i.e. <m> L t </m> is given by <m> L t _ g ( f ) ( h ) = f ( g ^ { - 1 } h ) </m> for a continuous function <m> f \in C ( G ) </m> and <m> h \in G </m> . my question : is <m> T \otimes L t \colon G \to \operatorname { A u t } ( A \otimes C ( G ) ) </m> the dual action of <m> T </m> , or is it possible to identify the dual action of <m> T </m> with <m> T \otimes L t </m> ? -LRB- <m> \otimes </m> here means the minimal tensor product of <m> C ^ * </m> - algebras , but note that <m> C ( G ) </m> is nuclear -RRB- first of all , the dual action is an action <m> \hat { T } \colon \hat { G } \to \operatorname { A u t } ( A \rtimes _ T G ) </m> , defined by <m> \hat { T } _ \tau ( \sum _ { s \in G } a _ s \delta _ s ) = \sum _ { s \in G } a _ s \tau ( s ) \delta _ s </m> for <m> \tau \in \hat { G } </m> and <m> \sum _ s a _ s \delta _ s \in C _ C ( G , A ) </m> . <m> \hat { G } </m> denotes the dual group -LRB- the pontryagin dual -RRB- of <m> G </m> . since <m> T </m> is the trivial action , there is an isomorphism <m> A \rtimes _ T G \to A \otimes _ { m a x } C ^ * ( G ) , </m> induced by the canonical map <m> \sum _ s a _ s \cdot \delta _ s \mapsto \sum _ s a _ s \otimes \delta _ s </m> on the <m> * </m> - algebraic tensor products -LRB- <m> C ^ * ( G ) </m> means the full group <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra of <m> G </m> -RRB- . since <m> C ^ * ( G ) </m> is nuclear , <m> A \otimes _ { m a x } C ^ * ( G ) \cong A \otimes C ^ * ( G ) </m> . forthermore , there is an isomorphism <m> F \colon C ^ * ( G ) \to C ( \hat { G } ) , </m> given by the fourier transform <m> F ( f ) ( \chi ) = \sum \limits _ { g \in G } f ( g ) \chi ( g ) </m> , where <m> f \in C _ C ( G ) </m> and <m> \chi \in \hat { G } </m> . all in all , after composing these isomorphisms , we obtain an action <m> \hat { T } \colon \hat { G } \to \operatorname { A u t } ( A \otimes C ( \hat { G } ) ) </m> which does not look like <m> T \otimes L t \colon \hat { G } \to \operatorname { A u t } ( A \otimes C ( \hat { G } ) ) </m> to me , or does it ? the last step is to identify <m> \hat { G } \cong G </m> -LRB- but this is not canonically isomorphic -RRB- . i appreciate your help .

a few weeks ago , i asked on math.stackexchange.com how many quadruples of non-negative integers <m> ( a , b , c , d ) </m> satisfy the following equation : <m> 2 ^ a + 3 ^ b = 2 ^ c + 3 ^ d \quad ( a \neq c ) </m> i found 5 quadruples : <m> 5 = 2 ^ 2 + 3 ^ 0 = 2 ^ 1 + 3 ^ 1 </m> , <m> 1 1 = 2 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 1 = 2 ^ 1 + 3 ^ 2 </m> , <m> 1 7 = 2 ^ 4 + 3 ^ 0 = 2 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 2 </m> , <m> 3 5 = 2 ^ 5 + 3 ^ 1 = 2 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3 </m> , <m> 2 5 9 = 2 ^ 8 + 3 ^ 1 = 2 ^ 4 + 3 ^ 5 </m> i did n't get an answer , but only a link to an oeis sequence -LRB- no more quadruples below <m> 1 0 ^ { 4 0 0 0 } </m> -RRB- , so i 'm asking the same question here .
i 'm thinking about making an attempt at counting the number of latin squares of order 12 . currently i 'm in -LRB- what i call -RRB- the `` sanity check '' stage , where we check that the ranges that need searching through are n't too massive . the standard method of counting latin squares involves building up from latin rectangles . we get an improvement if we `` forget '' the structure of the latin rectangle and remember only which symbols occur in which column -LRB- in fact , this is what 's makes counting latin squares possible-ish , the idea goes back to sade -RRB- . this can be achieved by interpreting the latin rectangle as a k-regular subgraph of <m> K _ { n , n } </m> . so , in order to perform my sanity check , i 'm after the number of non-isomorphic <m> k </m> - regular subgraphs of <m> K _ { 1 2 , 1 2 } </m> where <m> k \in \{ 1 , 2 , \ldots , 6 \} </m> -LRB- where subgraphs include all 24 vertices -RRB- . -LRB- sloane 's http://oeis.org/a008327 -RRB- . i 'm particularly interested in the case <m> k = 6 </m> .

define the ramanujan theta function <m> f ( a , b ) </m> as , <m> f ( a , b ) = \sum _ { n = - \infty } ^ { \infty } a ^ { n ( n + 1 ) / 2 } \, b ^ { n ( n - 1 ) / 2 } </m> and the dedekind eta function , <m> \eta ( \tau ) = q ^ { 1 / 2 4 } \prod _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \left ( 1 - q ^ n \right ) </m> a. in ramanujan 's notebooks iii , p. 372 , entry 8 he gives a series of identities which can be summarized as follows : let <m> q = e ^ { 2 \pi i \tau } </m> and <m> h _ k = ( - 1 ) ^ { k - 1 } q ^ { k ( - 1 3 + 3 k ) / 2 6 } \, \frac { f ( - q ^ { 2 k } , - q ^ { 1 3 - 2 k } ) } { f ( - q ^ { k } , - q ^ { 1 3 - k } ) } \; \; \text { f o r } \; k = 1 , \dots , 6 . </m> then the 3 roots of the cubic <m> \left ( \frac { \eta ( \tau ) } { \eta ( 1 3 \tau ) } \right ) ^ 2 = \frac { y ^ 3 + y ^ 2 - 4 y + 1 } { y ( 1 - y ) } \tag { 0 } </m> are <m> y _ 1 = h _ 1 h _ 5 , \; \; y _ 2 = h _ 2 h _ 3 , \; \; y _ 3 = h _ 4 h _ 6 . </m> b. i suspected this might have an analogue for <m> n = 2 5 </m> , the last integer such that <m> n - 1 </m> divides <m> 2 4 </m> . define <m> h _ k = ( - 1 ) ^ { k - 1 } q ^ { k ( - 2 5 + 3 k ) / 5 0 } \, \frac { f ( - q ^ { 2 k } , - q ^ { 2 5 - 2 k } ) } { f ( - q ^ { k } , - q ^ { 2 5 - k } ) } \; \; \text { f o r } \; k = 1 , \dots , 1 2 . \tag { 1 } </m> one pair is a constant , <m> h _ 5 h _ { 1 0 } = - 1 </m> . after some experimentation with mathematica 's integer relations , the other five pairs were the roots of a quintic which , to my surprise , turned out to be the emma lehmer quintic for real cyclic fields , <m> 1 + ( 1 0 + 1 0 v + 4 v ^ 2 + v ^ 3 ) x + ( 5 + 1 5 v + 1 1 v ^ 2 + 5 v ^ 3 + v ^ 4 ) x ^ 2 \, - 2 ( 5 + 5 v + 3 v ^ 2 + v ^ 3 ) x ^ 3 + v ^ 2 x ^ 4 + x ^ 5 = 0 . \tag { 2 } </m> this is solvable in radicals for any <m> v </m> . moreover , if we let <m> v = \frac { 1 } { R ( q ^ 5 ) } - R ( q ^ 5 ) - 1 = \frac { \eta ( \tau ) } { \eta ( 2 5 \tau ) } , \tag { 3 } </m> where <m> R ( q ) </m> is the rogers-ramanujan continued fraction , then it can be empirically observed that the five roots are <m> x _ 1 , \, \dots , \, x _ 5 = h _ 1 h _ 7 , \; h _ 2 h _ { 1 1 } , \; h _ 3 h _ 4 , \; h _ 6 h _ 8 , \; h _ 9 h _ { 1 2 } , \tag { 4 } </m> hence emma lehmer 's quintic is analogous to ramanujan 's cubic . question : anybody knows how to prove that if <m> v </m> is defined by <m> ( 3 ) </m> , then these <m> x _ i </m> are indeed the roots ?
i have spent an insane amount of time searching for a preprint i have printed a few months ago but misplaced . i can not find it anymore and this drives me crazy . it might not have been meant for publication , or might be more of a survey , i am not sure . i do not remember the authors -LRB- obviously -RRB- but remember the content : it was notably proved that <m> C ^ 1 </m> partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms have hölder-continuous stable holonomies . i insist on <m> C ^ 1 </m> -LRB- i know the <m> C ^ 2 </m> case dates back to pugh , shub and wilkinson -RRB- . the paper also proved absolute continuity of holonomies in <m> C ^ { 1 + \alpha } </m> regularity .
for some numerical analysis of a fluid , i am wondering if there is any inequality that provides a lower bound -LRB- in the <m> L ^ 2 </m> norm -RRB- , for the <m> L ^ 2 </m> inner product of a quantity with its derivative . in particular , i am seeking one that is useful for the form : <m> ( D ( x ) , D ( v ) ) _ { L ^ 2 } + ( \nabla \cdot { x } , \nabla \cdot { v } ) _ { L ^ 2 } + ( \nabla \cdot { v } , \nabla \cdot { v } ) _ { L ^ 2 } \ge C \| \nabla x \| ^ 2 _ { L ^ 2 } + K \| \nabla v \| ^ 2 _ { L ^ 2 } </m> for constants <m> C > 0 </m> and <m> K \ge 0 </m> , where strain-rate tensor <m> D ( v ) \equiv \frac 1 2 ( \nabla v + ( \nabla v ) ^ T ) </m> , <m> t </m> represents time , and velocity <m> v = \frac { d } { d t } x </m> for displacement <m> x </m> . i am trying to see if i can show that the left hand side is coercive in terms of <m> \nabla x </m> . i.e. it is okay if <m> K </m> may be zero . <m> x </m> and <m> v </m> are in the sobolev space <m> V = \{ \varphi \in ( H ^ 1 ( \Omega ) ) ^ d \; | \; \varphi = 0 \textrm { o n } \partial \Omega \} </m> where <m> \Omega </m> is a <m> d - </m> dimensional region of the fluid flow , for <m> d = 2 , 3 </m> . p.s. if the inequality were to be reversed , i would have used the fact that <m> \| \nabla \cdot { v } \| _ { L ^ 2 } \le \sqrt { d } \| \nabla { v } \| _ { L ^ 2 } </m> for a <m> d </m> - dimensional domain ; and also applied cauchy-schwartz inequality , then young 's inequality , and korn 's inequality . this answer on math se mentions kantorovich inequalities , but there is no reference and my searches so far have been futile .

in reading the harris-taylor book , i encounter expressions like `` let <m> \xi </m> be an algebraic representation of <m> G </m> over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> '' . what does this mean ? here <m> G </m> is a reductive group over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> , namely a group scheme over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> . it seems to me that what they really mean is that <m> \xi </m> is a representation of the real points <m> G ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> . am i understanding correct ? also what does `` algebraic '' mean ?
i have seen the following statment somewhere , for example in appendix b2 on silverman 's book `` the arithmetic of elliptic curves '' : let <m> M </m> be an abelian group with discrete topology and <m> G </m> be a profinite group . then an linear action -LRB- which means that <m> \sigma ( m _ 1 + m _ 2 ) = \sigma ( m _ 1 ) + \sigma ( m _ 2 ) </m> , i.e it is a <m> G </m> - module -RRB- <m> \phi : G \times M \rightarrow M </m> is continuous if and only if the stabilizer <m> \sigma \in G | \sigma ( m ) = m </m> has finite index in <m> G </m> for all <m> m \in M </m> . but what we need is that this stabilizer is open in <m> G </m> . i also saw that in a profinite group , not every subgroup of finite index is open . so is this statement correct ? or how to see that this stabilizer is open if it has finite rank ?
for an odd prime <m> p </m> , let <m> \zeta : = e ^ { \frac { \pi i } p } </m> and choose odd <m> 1 < n < p </m> . further let <m> q ( x ) </m> and <m> r ( x ) </m> be integer polynomials such that <m> r ( x ) </m> has no common factor with <m> x ^ n + 1 </m> , and <m> \xi </m> any root of unity -LRB- not necessarily related to <m> \zeta </m> -RRB- .
1-let <m> P \in L </m> be a nontrivial set forcing or even a tame class forcing -LRB- tameness in the sense of sy friedman ; see for example his handbook paper -RRB- , and let <m> G </m> be <m> P - </m> generic over <m> L </m> . then it is well-known that in <m> L [ G ] , </m> <m> 0 ^ \sharp </m> does not exist , hence by jensen 's covering lemma the pair <m> ( L , L [ G ] ) </m> satisfies the covering lemma ; i.e any uncountable set <m> X \in L [ G ] </m> of ordinals is covered by a set <m> Y \in L </m> of the same cardinality . is there a direct proof of this fact without using jensen 's covering lemma and using the properties of <m> P </m> and the fact that we are forcing over <m> L </m> ? 2-work in <m> L </m> . let <m> P </m> be the easton support product of forcing notions <m> A d d ( \kappa ^ + , 1 ) , \kappa </m> a singular cardinal . then <m> P </m> is tame , preserves cardinals and the <m> G C H </m> . is there any tame class forcing notion <m> Q </m> such that forcing with <m> P \times Q </m> over <m> L </m> collapses all cardinals into <m> \omega </m> remark . it is possible to define a tame and cardinal preserving class forcing notion <m> P </m> over <m> L </m> whose product <m> P \times P </m> collapses all cardinals into <m> \omega </m> .
let <m> A </m> be a poisson <m> \mathbb { C } </m> - algebra : <m> A </m> has a the structure of a complex commutative algebra and at the same time it carries the structure of a lie algebra , with lie bracket <m> \{ \cdot , \cdot \} </m> . the latter should be a biderivation of the commutative multiplication , as well as the lie multiplication . just as the definition of an <m> A </m> - module may be seen as an abstraction of left multiplication of <m> A </m> on itself , we can define a poisson <m> A </m> - module to be a vector space <m> V </m> together with two multiplicative rules <m> A \times V \rightarrow V </m> satisfying compatibility conditions . for more detail see one of the original papers by farkas . my question is the following : is every simple poisson module finitely generated as an <m> A </m> - module ? i expect that the answer is ` no ' although i have been unable to find a counterexample or indeed any reference which considers this question . i am especially interested in the case where <m> A </m> is an affine algebra , ie . finitely generated and reduced . proposition 1.1 in the paper cited above states that when <m> A </m> is symplectic every poisson module is induced by a <m> \mathcal { D } </m> - module , so this may be a fertile source of counterexamples : is every simple <m> \mathcal { D } ( A ) </m> - module finitely generated over <m> A </m> ? thanks in advance ! edit : following ben 's response i am now specifically looking for examples where <m> A </m> is a reduced poisson algebras , ie . no nilpotent elements .
hi , i 'm trying to find all rational points on the surface of the title , in connection with the euler brick -LRB- aka rational box -RRB- problem . this surface is equivalent to <m> x ^ 2 z ^ 2 - 1 = ( x ^ 2 - z ^ 2 ) y ^ 2 </m> , and it is easy to find an addition formula for rational points by jogging the second into a form conformable with the equations defining jacobian elliptic functions : a rational point on the second form clearly implies rational <m> a , b , . . e </m> -LRB- and conversely -RRB- satisfying the pair <m> ( a b ) ^ 2 - 1 = e ( a b c ) ^ 2 </m> and <m> ( a b ) ^ 2 - b ^ 4 = e ( a b d ) ^ 2 </m> and dividing each by <m> ( a b ) ^ 2 </m> , one can express the variables as follows with modulus <m> k = b ^ 2 </m> : <m> s n ( k , u ) = 1 / ( a b ) </m> <m> c n ( k , u ) = \sqrt e . c </m> <m> d n ( k , u ) = \sqrt e . d </m> because in the addition formulae for jacobian elliptic functions , <m> c n </m> and <m> d n </m> arise only in products of pairs , and `` cross products '' <m> c n . d n </m> occur only in the resulting <m> s n </m> , this means that a pair of rational solutions with <m> e = e _ 1 </m> and <m> e = e _ 2 </m> implies a rational solution with <m> E = e _ 1 e _ 2 </m> to the pair : <m> C ^ 2 + E S ^ 2 = 1 </m> <m> D ^ 2 + b ^ 4 E S ^ 2 = 1 </m> treating this as a diophantine pair in its own right , without reference to elliptic functions , one can absorb <m> S ^ 2 </m> into e , and plug the expression for <m> E </m> given by the first into the second to obtain : <m> D ^ 2 - b ^ 4 C ^ 2 = 1 - b ^ 4 </m> for any given <m> b </m> this is a conic curve , with a rational point <m> C , D = 1 , 1 </m> and hence has a rational parametrization over q , in b ^ 4 and some parameter t say . now i 'm sure the original surface is not rational -LRB- i gather it is a k3 surface -RRB- . but i wonder if the above can be reversed , to some extent , to at least give a procedure for finding all rational points on the surface from those of the pencil of conics parametrized by <m> b </m> .
this is sort of a strange question ; if it 's not appropriate for mathoverflow i apologize in advance . i 'm in a situation where i 'd like to be able to give a computer two <m> G L _ n </m> representations <m> V </m> and <m> W </m> and compute a basis the subspace of <m> \mathrm { H o m } ( V , W ) </m> consisting of all the <m> G L _ n </m> - equivariant maps . i 'd like a basis that 's as explicit as possible -- consisting of actual matrices . we can say that <m> V </m> and <m> W </m> are given in terms of a square matrix of polynomials in <m> n ^ 2 </m> variables specifying the action of <m> G L _ n </m> , though in my case i actually just want <m> \mathrm { H o m } _ G ( \mathbb { S } _ \nu ( \mathbb { C } ^ n ) , \mathbb { S } _ \lambda ( \mathbb { C } ^ n ) \otimes \mathbb { S } _ \mu ( \mathbb { C } ^ n ) ) </m> for some partitions <m> \lambda , \mu , \nu </m> . -LRB- <m> \mathbb { S } _ \lambda </m> is the schur functor . -RRB- i 'm happy to just handle this case . -LRB- obviously i know how to find the solution abstractly , but i 'd like an actual basis of actual matrices . -RRB- i have a bad , slow way to do this in macaulay2 already which seems to work . say <m> V = \mathbb { S } _ \nu ( \mathbb { C } ^ n ) </m> is irreducible . we look at the map from <m> \mathrm { H o m } ( V , W ) </m> to itself given by <m> T \mapsto g T - T g </m> . we think of this as a map from <m> R ^ { \oplus ( \dim V \cdot \dim W ) } </m> to itself , where <m> R </m> is a polynomial ring in <m> n ^ 2 </m> variables , and take its kernel as a map of modules . then the submodule we want is the <m> | \nu | </m> - graded part of this kernel . this is quite slow , and it also feels like it 's computing more than i need , but i ca n't come up with anything that 's any faster . -LRB- the other idea i had was to take that matrix of polynomials and look for the subspace where each coefficient is zero . this is even slower . -RRB- is there a smarter way to do this ?
problem : for <m> 1 < p < \infty </m> , <m> p \ne 2 </m> , has the complex banach space <m> L ^ p ( \mathbb T ^ \omega ) </m> got a schauder basis consisting of characters of the compact topological group <m> \mathbb T ^ \omega </m> ?
this follows up the comment which suggests that asking the later 2nd part of subquestion in `` gso -LRB- gliozzi-scherk-olive -RRB- projection and its mathematics '' as a new different question gso -LRB- gliozzi-scherk-olive -RRB- projection is an ingredient used in constructing a consistent model in superstring theory . the projection is a selection of a subset of possible vertex operators in the worldsheet conformal field theory -LRB- cft -RRB- -- usually those with specific worldsheet fermion number and periodicity conditions . such a projection is necessary to obtain a consistent worldsheet cft . for terminology , for a compact 1-manifold as a <m> S ^ 1 </m> circle , there are two spin structures , let one be periodic or antiperiodic in going around the circle . in string theory , these are called
let <m> \alpha </m> be an orientation-preserving automorphism of the torus <m> T ^ 2 = S ^ 1 \times S ^ 1 . </m> since the mapping torus <m> M _ { \alpha } = T ^ 2 \times [ 0 , 1 ] / ( x , 0 ) \sim ( \alpha ( x ) , 1 ) </m> is an orientable compact 3-dimensional manifold , it is <m> s p i n ^ c . </m> but is there a <m> s p i n ^ c </m> structure on <m> M _ { \alpha } </m> that restricts to the trivial <m> s p i n ^ c </m> structure on <m> T ^ 2 \times [ 1 / 4 , 3 / 4 ] </m> ? thank you !
recall that a poset is directed if every finite subset has an upper bound , and directed-complete -LRB- a dcpo -RRB- if every directed subset has a join -LRB- supremum -RRB- . in a dcpo , <m> x \ll y </m> is defined to mean that every directed subset with join <m> \ge y </m> contains some element <m> \ge x </m> , and <m> x </m> is compact if <m> x \ll x </m> . a dcpo is continuous if every element <m> x </m> is the join of a directed set of elements <m> \ll x </m> , and algebraic if every element is the join of a directed set of compact elements . define also the above terms prefixed with '' <m> \sigma </m> - '' by replacing `` finite '' with `` countable '' throughout . i 'm looking for -LRB- a -RRB- a written-down reference for the following -LRB- easy -RRB- fact , which i 'm guessing is standard in domain theory : every continuous dcpo is <m> \sigma </m> - algebraic . -LRB- proof : given <m> x \ll y </m> , find <m> x \ll x _ 1 \ll x _ 2 \ll \dotsb \ll y </m> ; then <m> \bigvee _ i x _ i </m> is <m> \sigma </m> - compact , and it is easy to check that the set of such elements is <m> \sigma </m> - directed below <m> y </m> . i think there may also be an `` abstract nonsense '' proof using the urysohn-lawson lemma ; pointers appreciated . -RRB- furthermore , it seems -LRB- i have n't checked the details -RRB- that one can characterize the posets which are the <m> \sigma </m> - compact elements in some continuous dcpo -LRB- from which the dcpo can thus be recovered as the <m> \sigma </m> - ideals -RRB- : they are the posets with joins of countable increasing sequences , which are `` continuous '' with respect to such joins . i 'd appreciate -LRB- b -RRB- a reference which also mentions this -LRB- assuming it 's true -RRB- , and possibly other facts concerning such posets -LRB- `` continuous '' wrt countable directed joins -RRB- . i 've checked continuous lattices and domains -LRB- aka a compendium of continuous lattices -RRB- and stone spaces , but neither seems to mention <m> \sigma </m> - algebraicity , etc. there appears to be a notion of `` continuous <m> \omega </m> - chain-complete poset -LRB- <m> \omega </m> - ccpo -RRB- '' in the literature -LRB- e.g. , here -RRB- , but it does n't seem to quite coincide with the posets mentioned in -LRB- b -RRB- above . -LRB- for example , it excludes an uncountable antichain . -RRB-
a standard measure on trees on <m> n </m> vertices is the uniform spanning tree -LRB- ust -RRB- on the complete graph . this is the measure where every tree has equal probability , <m> 1 / n ^ { n - 2 } </m> by cayley 's formula . here is another measure . take an erdős -- rényi -LRB- i.e. edge independent -RRB- random graph <m> G \in G ( n , p ) </m> with <m> p </m> large enough to ensure that <m> G </m> is asymptotically almost surely connected , and then choose a ust on <m> G </m> . note that if <m> p = 1 </m> these two measures are identical . my guess is that they are close -LRB- say in total variation distance -RRB- , even for much smaller <m> p </m> . in particular , suppose that <m> p \ge \frac { \log n + \omega } { n } , </m> where <m> \omega \to \infty </m> arbitrarily slowly as <m> n \to \infty </m> . -LRB- this is barely sufficient to guarantee that the probability that <m> G </m> is connected tends to one . -RRB-
i 'm studying the spectral theorem as appears in reed and simon 's functional analysis . assume we have constructed the continuous functional calculus for a self adjoint bounded operator <m> A </m> on a hilbert space <m> H </m> . the construction of the borel functional calculus is through a function <m> \Phi : \mathbb { B } ( \mathbb { R } ) \to L ( H ) </m> from the bounded borel functions to bounded linear operators on <m> H </m> , which extends the continuous functional calculus . please see this link for the explicit construction -LRB- page 4 of the pdf -RRB- : http://www.math.mcgill.ca/jakobson/courses/ma667/mendelsontomberg-spectral.pdf i want to show <m> A B = B A \implies B \Phi ( f ) = \Phi ( f ) B </m> . the claim is clearly true for polynomials -LRB- for <m> f ( x ) = x , \Phi ( f ) = A </m> -RRB- , and hence for continuous functions , being the uniform limit of polynomials and as <m> \Phi </m> is continuous under the supremum norm . my attempt : step 1 is to prove <m> \forall x \in H ( x , B \Phi ( f ) x ) = ( x , \Phi ( f ) B x ) </m> . step 2 is to notice that the above implies <m> \forall x , y \in H </m> <m> ( x , B \Phi ( f ) y ) = ( x , \Phi ( f ) B y ) </m> by the polarization identity . step 3 the above of course implies that <m> \Phi ( f ) B = B \Phi ( f ) </m> . so we only need a proof for 1 : set <m> x \in H </m> . define <m> \phi _ k = B ^ * x + i ^ k x </m> for <m> k \in \{ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 \} </m> , <m> \psi _ k = x + i ^ k B x </m> for <m> k \in \{ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 \} </m> . define <m> \mu = \sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { 3 } | \mu _ { \phi _ k } | + | \mu _ { \psi _ k } | </m> . where <m> \mu _ { \phi _ k } </m> , <m> \mu _ { \psi _ k } </m> are the spectral measures associated to the corresponding vectors . as each is a regular borel measure it follows that <m> \mu </m> is a regular borel measure . choose <m> \{ f _ n \} \subset C ( \sigma ( A ) ) </m> s.t <m> \int f _ n d \mu \to \int f d \mu </m> . it follows that <m> \int f _ n \mu _ { \psi _ k } \to \int f \mu _ { \psi _ k } </m> , and <m> \int f _ n \mu _ { \phi _ k } \to \int f \mu _ { \phi _ k } </m> for all <m> k \in \{ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 \} </m> . so we have that -LRB- see the mcgill link -LRB- page 4 -RRB- for the second and sixth equalities -RRB- : <m> ( x , B \Phi ( f ) x ) = ( B ^ * x , \Phi ( f ) x ) \overset { d e f i n i t i o n } { = } \frac { 1 } { 4 } \sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { 3 } i ^ k \int f d \mu _ { \phi _ k } = l i m _ n \frac { 1 } { 4 } \sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { 3 } i ^ k \int f _ n d \mu _ { \phi _ k } = l i m _ n ( B ^ * x , \Phi ( f _ n ) x ) \overset { f _ n \in C ( \sigma ( A ) ) } { = } l i m _ n ( x , \Phi ( f _ n ) B x ) = l i m _ n \frac { 1 } { 4 } \sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { 3 } i ^ k \int f _ n d \mu _ { \psi _ k } = \frac { 1 } { 4 } \sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { 3 } i ^ k \int f d \mu _ { \psi _ k } = ( x , \Phi ( f ) B x ) </m> . btw , also posted this question on mse , but the methods suggested draw from backgrounds i do n't have yet , and i 'd like to get feedback for this answer .
probably this is a trivial question , but i am unable to find an answer : is there a function <m> v ( x ) </m> such that <m> \int _ { 0 } ^ \infty x ^ n e ^ { v ( x ) } d x = \frac { 1 } { n ! } </m> for all positiv integer n ?
let <m> \omega ^ \omega </m> denote the set of all functions <m> f : \omega \to \omega </m> . we write <m> f < ^ * g </m> if there is <m> N \in \omega </m> such that <m> f ( n ) < g ( n ) </m> for all <m> n > N </m> . a set <m> D \subseteq \omega ^ \omega </m> is said to be dominating if for all <m> f \in \omega ^ \omega </m> there is <m> g \in D </m> such that <m> f < ^ * g </m> . set <m> \frak { d } = \textrm { m i n } \{ | \mathrm { D } | : \mathrm { D } \subseteq \omega ^ \omega \textrm { a n d } \mathrm { D } \textrm { i s d o m i n a t i n g } \} . </m> is it consistent that <m> \frak { d } < 2 ^ { \aleph _ 0 } </m> ?
i 'm looking for explicit bases of weight 2 modular forms under <m> \Gamma ( N ) </m> , for small n -LRB- < 16 would be enough -RRB- . -LRB- ideally in terms of theta - or eta-functions -RRB- it seems to me that this should probably be a problem that people have already solved but i ca n't find good references .
has anyone discovered a vector of algebraic real numbers <m> ( a _ 1 , . . . , a _ k ) </m> such that <m> 1 , a _ 1 , . . . , a _ k </m> are linearly independent over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> and such that <m> ( a _ 1 , . . . , a _ k ) </m> is not `` badly approximable '' ? has anyone discovered a vector of algebraic real numbers <m> ( a _ 1 , . . . , a _ k ) </m> such that <m> [ \mathbb { Q } ( a _ 1 , . . . , a _ k ) : \mathbb { Q } ] > k + 1 </m> but such that <m> ( a _ 1 , . . . , a _ k ) </m> is `` badly approximable '' ? knowing whether either of these is open would be a great help . by badly approximable i mean that there exists <m> c > 0 </m> such that the <m> \ell _ \infty </m> distance from <m> ( q a _ 1 , . . . , q a _ k ) </m> to <m> \mathbb { Z } ^ k </m> is greater than <m> c q ^ { - 1 / k } </m> for all large <m> q \in \mathbb { N } </m> . or the equivalent notion that there exists <m> c > 0 </m> such that the distance from <m> \sum _ i q _ i a _ i </m> to <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> is greater than <m> c \| q \| _ { \ell _ \infty } ^ { - k } </m> for all large <m> q \in \mathbb { Z } ^ k </m> .
hi , i 'm interested in the behaviour of the sequence <m> ( \sin ( n ! \pi x ) ) </m> , when <m> x </m> is irrational , as <m> n </m> tends to infinity . 1 -RRB- is the sequence dense in <m> ( - 1 , 1 ) </m> ? or 2 -RRB- is it possible that for some irrational <m> x </m> , <m> \sin ( n ! \pi x ) </m> tends to <m> 0 </m> as <m> n </m> tends to infinity ? any reference would be appreciated , thank you
the definition of a monoidal model category requires that the tensor product is biclosed -LRB- such is needed to ensure that the tensor product is derivable in both variables -RRB- . obviously , in the situation of relative categories and simplicial categories , which we know model all <m> \infty </m> - categories , we ca n't really pull this off . so a few questions : what explicit data , if any , give <m> E _ 1 </m> - monoidal structures on simplicial and relative categories ? given an actual monoidal model category <m> M </m> , an on-the-nose braiding satisfying the strict coherences gives <m> M </m> an <m> E _ 2 </m> monoidal structure . are all <m> E _ 2 </m> enhancements represented by strict braidings ? more generally , can we say that a monoidal model category <m> M </m> is <m> E _ n </m> monoidal by demanding that particular explicit function complexes are <m> n </m> - connected ?
let <m> A , B , C </m> be finitely generated abelian groups . assume that there is an exact sequence <m> 0 \to C \to A ^ n \to B ^ n \to 0 , </m> where <m> A ^ n = A \oplus \dotsc \oplus A </m> as usual . it is not assumed that <m> A ^ n \to B ^ n </m> is induced by some <m> A \to B </m> .
let <m> ( X , \tau ) </m> be a topological space . for a given topological base <m> \mathcal { E } </m> for <m> \tau </m> , let us denote bor <m> ( \mathcal { E } ) </m> , by the smallest <m> \sigma </m> - algebra containing <m> \mathcal { E } </m> . q. assume that bor <m> ( \mathcal { E } ) = </m> bor <m> ( \tau ) </m> . let <m> O </m> be an open in <m> X </m> . does there exists a sequence of open sets <m> \{ O _ n \} \subseteq \mathcal { E } </m> with <m> O = \cup O _ n </m> ?
the motivation for this question comes from this paper where we study lower bounds on the complexity of convex optimization algorithms -LRB- btw , if you find a better title for my question , please let me know -RRB- . some notation : let <m> X = B _ p ^ n </m> be the unit ball of <m> ( \mathbb { R } ^ n , \| \cdot \| _ p ) </m> , and let <m> Y = B _ { q _ { \ast } } ^ n </m> be the unit ball of <m> ( \mathbb { R } ^ n , \| \cdot \| _ { q _ { \ast } } ) </m> , where <m> 2 \leq p , q \leq \infty </m> and <m> 1 / q + 1 / q _ { \ast } = 1 </m> -LRB- in the paper we consider the case <m> p = q </m> -RRB- . let now <m> T \leq n </m> . one of the key ingredients of our analysis depends on finding linear functionals <m> \xi ^ t \in Y </m> , <m> t = 1 , \ldots , T </m> , such that we can lower bound , for arbitrary <m> s _ t = \pm 1 </m> , the quantity <m> \Delta _ { p , q } ^ { T , n } = - \min _ { x \in X } \max _ { 1 \leq t \leq T } s _ t \langle \xi ^ t , x \rangle . </m> in the case <m> p = q </m> this is done by simply picking <m> \xi ^ t </m> to be the first <m> T </m> canonical vectors , which gives <m> \Delta _ { p , p } ^ { T , n } \geq 1 / T ^ { 1 / p } </m> . my question is whether there exist good lower bounds when <m> p \neq q </m> . in general , by simple dualization arguments , this turns out to be equivalent to <m> \Delta _ { p , q } ^ { T , n } = \min _ { \lambda \in \partial B _ 1 ^ T } \left \| \sum _ { t = 1 } ^ T \lambda _ t \xi ^ t \right \| _ { p _ { \ast } } , </m> where <m> \partial B _ 1 ^ T </m> denotes the boundary of the <m> \| \cdot \| _ 1 </m> - unit ball . therefore , we are just looking for a linear transformation <m> \Xi : B _ 1 ^ T \to B _ { p _ { \ast } } ^ n </m> -LRB- in matrix form : <m> \Xi = [ \xi ^ 1 | \ldots | \xi ^ T ] </m> , where each <m> \| \xi ^ t \| _ { q _ { \ast } } = 1 </m> -RRB- with <m> \mbox { k e r } ( \Xi ) = 0 </m> , and with the image of the boundary of the cross-polytope as far as possible from the origin . this question looks remarkably similar to some computations for <m> \ell _ p </m> embeddings in the local theory of banach spaces . however , this is far from my expertise , so i have n't been able to extract useful ideas from there . if you see some explicit connection with something that is known -LRB- or figure out a simple way to lower bound <m> \Delta </m> -RRB- , please let me know .

i am aware of some of the history of the gamma function <m> \Gamma ( z ) </m> , partly through a 2009 -LRB- ! -RRB- mo question `` who invented the gamma function ?

we consider the class <m> C </m> of directed simple -LRB- no multiple edges -RRB- graphs having the property that every vertex is reachable by a directed path from every other vertex . given an integer <m> k </m> , what is the maximal possible number of -LRB- directed -RRB- edges in a graph of <m> C </m> with <m> n </m> vertices such that there are no directed cycles of length <m> \leq k </m> ? for <m> k = 2 </m> this means simply that the existence of an edge from <m> v </m> to <m> w </m> forbids the existence of an edge from <m> w </m> to <m> v </m> and one can thus choose arbitrary orientions -LRB- giving rise to a graph in <m> C </m> -RRB- on the edges of the complete unoriented graph . for <m> k = 3 </m> , one has also to forbid oriented triangles which is not possible by orienting all edges of a complete graph on <m> n \geq 3 </m> vertices such that the result is in <m> C </m> . on the other hand , there are of course no triangles by choosing arbitrary orientations -LRB- giving rise to an element in <m> C </m> -RRB- of a complete bipartite graph . there are thus such graphs having roughly <m> n ^ 2 / 4 </m> directed edges . there should be better upper and lower bounds . motivation : g. higman -LRB- a finitely generated infinite simple group . j. london math . soc . 26 , -LRB- 1951 -RRB- . 61 -- 64 -RRB- constructed finitely generated infinite simple groups by considering quotients of the finitely presented group <m> \langle g _ 1 , \dots , g _ n | g _ { i - 1 } ^ { - 1 } g _ i g _ { i - 1 } = g _ i ^ 2 \rangle </m> where indices are modulo <m> n </m> . this group is trivial for <m> n = 2 , 3 </m> and infinite for <m> n \geq 4 </m> . given a directed graph , one can consider the corresponding group-presentation with generators corresponding to vertices and directed edges corresponding to relations <m> a ^ { - 1 } b a = b ^ 2 </m> . the triviality of the group constructed by higman associated to <m> n = 2 , 3 </m> implies that we want to avoid oriented cycles of length <m> \leq 3 </m> when searching for interesting examples .
let <m> L ( C , s ) = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { a _ n } { n ^ s } </m> be the dirichlet series of the hasse -- weil l-function of an elliptic curve <m> C </m> over <m>  </m> . the modularity theorem implies that <m> L ( C , s ) </m> is the <m> L </m> - function of a holomorphic cusp form for a congruence subgroup and it is entire function and have a holomorphic continuation . also there is a rapidly-converging series <m> f ( s ) </m> expression <m> L ( C , s ) </m> for any complex number <m> s </m> given in http://modular.math.washington.edu/books/bsd/ on page 9 . i am interested on the real points <m> a </m> such that the equation <m> f ^ { ( k ) } ( s ) = a </m> have a finite number of real solutions <m> s </m> for some <m> k </m> . unfortunately , i have no idea to start .
after some months wandering through examples of algebraic groups in the theory of automorphic forms and number theory , i wonder why so many efforts are spent in understanding <m> G S p ( 4 ) </m> -LRB- local newforms , liftings , correspondences , etc. -RRB- without any mention to <m> P S p ( 4 ) </m> . explicit examples and computable settings are rare and valuable , and it seems far easier to deal with <m> P S p ( 4 ) </m> than with <m> G S p ( 4 ) </m> at first . is there any reason for not having anything in that direction ? are the results and theories involved straightforward from other known cases ?
article exotic <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 4 </m> on wikipedia says that there is at least one maximal smooth structure on <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 4 </m> , that is such an atlas on <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 4 </m> that any other smooth <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 4 </m> can be embedded into it . is the construction of such a maximal exotic <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 4 </m> explicit ? can anyone give a reference to the construction ? what is a good source -LRB- or sources -RRB- with examples of exotic smooth structures on <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 4 </m> ? thanks .
i am not specialist on topological group theory , i apologize if this is a trivial question . question . if <m> G _ 1 = G _ 2 </m> are amenable topological groups what additional hypothesis we have to consider on the group , in order to prove that <m> G _ 1 \times G _ 2 </m> is amenable ? following leinster , in this question why are abelian groups amenable ? , `` the direct product of two amenable groups is amenable . this is n't exactly trivial , but the measure on the product is at least constructed canonically from the two given measures . '' so discreteness of the <m> G _ 1 </m> and <m> G _ 2 </m> are enough to prove that <m> G _ 1 \times G _ 2 </m> is amenable and also we do not need to suppose that <m> G _ 1 = G _ 2 </m> . looking for a proof , in more general cases , i found the following statement : '' ... direct product <m> G _ 1 \times G _ 2 </m> of two countable amenable groups can not be amenable . '' in the paper , on subadditive processes on direct product of countable amenable groups by seyit temir - publications de l'institute mathématique -LRB- 2002 -RRB- , 119-122 . since the author did not mention if the example needs two different groups and i have no access to the paper containing this information , i decided to post this question . i would be grateful if you could point me out some references discussing about this problem .
the gessel sequence is known for ira gessel 's lattice path conjecture of <m> 2 0 0 1 </m> , which has been proved by kauers , koutschan and zeilberger in <m> 2 0 0 9 </m> with the aid of a computer . later , other proofs were found -LRB- `` human proofs '' -RRB- , e.g. , by using weierstrass elliptic functions -LRB- see here -RRB- . i was wondering whether or not it is true that the integers <m> a _ n </m> of the gessel sequence are never prime numbers for <m> n \ge 3 </m> . there is an easy recursion for this sequence , namely <m> a ( 0 ) : = 1 </m> and <m> a _ { n + 1 } = \frac { 4 ( 6 n + 5 ) ( 2 n + 1 ) } { ( 3 n + 5 ) ( n + 2 ) } a _ n </m> for all <m> n </m> . is there some -LRB- obvious -RRB- reason that all <m> a _ n </m> are composite ?
let <m> H = K _ 1 \oplus K _ 2 </m> be infinite dimensional hilbert spaces . voiculescu 's free gaussian functor gives us free group factors <m> L ( H ) </m> , <m> L ( K _ 1 ) </m> , <m> L ( K _ 2 ) </m> acting on the full fock space <m> \Gamma ( H ) </m> and , moreover , <m> L ( H ) = L ( K _ 1 ) * L ( K _ 2 ) </m> . but what is known about the relative commutant <m> L ( K _ 1 ) ' \cap L ( H ) </m> ? certainly <m> L ( K _ 1 ) </m> is non-amenable , so by ozawa 's result http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0608451 the relative commutant must be atomic . but i do n't know any more than that . in particular is it even nontrivial ?
it is common for people to reference that '' <m> O R D </m> is strongly inaccessible '' or '' <m> O R D </m> is mahlo '' . the first of these -LRB- when formalized -RRB- is easily proven in zfc . however , the latter is equiconsistent to the existence of reflecting cardinals . my question is -LRB- informally -RRB- how many large cardinal properties one could give <m> O R D </m> . generally , <m> O R D </m> having a large cardinal property is somewhat weaker than said large cardinal property . generally , if <m> \kappa </m> has the property then <m> V _ \kappa </m> or <m> V _ { \kappa + 1 } </m> satisfies that <m> O R D </m> has that property . first , i question <m> O R D </m> 's weak compactness . let <m> \mathcal { L } _ { \infty , \infty } </m> be <m> \bigcup _ { \alpha \in O R D } \mathcal { L } _ { \alpha , \alpha } </m> . let <m> O R D </m> be weakly compact iff for any <m> \mathcal { L } _ { \infty , \infty } </m> - theory <m> T </m> -LRB- allowing <m> T </m> to be a proper class -RRB- , <m> C o n ( T ) </m> iff for every set <m> t \subseteq T </m> , <m> C o n ( t ) </m> . secondly , i question <m> O R D </m> 's indescribability . let <m> O R D </m> be <m> Q </m> - indescribable iff : for any <m> Q </m> - sentence <m> \phi </m> in the language of <m> \{ \in , P \} </m> for <m> P </m> an unary predicate symbol and any class <m> A </m> : <m> \langle V ; \in , A \rangle \models \phi \Leftrightarrow \exists \alpha ( \langle V _ \alpha ; \in , A \cap V _ \alpha \rangle \models \phi ) </m> let <m> O R D </m> be totally indescribable iff it is <m> \Pi _ m ^ n </m> - indescribable for every <m> m </m> and <m> n </m> . thirdly , i question <m> O R D </m> 's subtlety -LRB- i skipped a few because i could not find a way to translate them to <m> O R D </m> ; namely strongly uplifting and unfoldable cardinals -RRB- . let <m> O R D </m> be subtle iff : for any sequence <m> \langle A _ \alpha : \alpha \in O R D \rangle </m> such that for any <m> \alpha </m> , <m> A _ \alpha </m> is a set of ordinals and any club class of ordinals <m> C </m> , there are <m> \alpha < \beta </m> in <m> C </m> such that <m> A _ \beta \cap \alpha = A _ \alpha </m> . next , i question <m> O R D </m> 's <m> n </m> - ineffability . for a class <m> W </m> , let <m> [ W ] ^ n </m> be the class of all subsets of <m> W </m> with cardinality <m> n </m> . let <m> O R D </m> be <m> n </m> - ineffable iff : for every class function <m> f : [ O R D ] ^ n \rightarrow 2 </m> , there is a class of ordinals <m> H </m> which is stationary in <m> O R D </m> where <m> f ( x ) = f ( y ) </m> for any two <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> in <m> [ H ] ^ n </m> .
i know that if there are enough hermitian elements in a banach algebra , then the banach algebra is stellar . in particular , i 'm interested in the two spaces <m> B ( L ^ 1 ( S ^ 1 , \Sigma , \mu ) ) </m> the space of bounded linear operators on lebesgue integrable functions of the circle and <m> B ( b a ( \Sigma ) ) </m> the space of bounded linear operators on finite , finitely-additive borel measures . i know about the results that having enough hermitian elements is sufficient , but i 'm not quite sure how to apply them . the issue comes up because i am trying to bound the inverse of a hermitian element in terms of its spectral radius . from my reading , we have an equality for <m> C ^ \star </m> algebras and an inequality for banach algebras .
in tate 's local duality theorem we find the isomorphism <m> H ^ 2 ( K , Q _ p ( 1 ) ) \cong Q _ p </m> where <m> K </m> is a finite extension of <m> Q _ p </m> . i have n't found any reference where this isomorphism is given explicitly -LRB- only kato 's article in `` grothendieck festchrift -RRB- . can anyone give me some reference or explicit this isomorphism please ?

this is just a question about notation , but it got no useful answers on math.stackexchange . let <m> L </m> be the lie algebra of <m> n \times n </m> hermitian matrices , with lie bracket <m> ( A , B ) \mapsto i ( A B - B A ) </m> . in a context where <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> are understood to be elements of <m> L </m> , i 'd like to write <m> [ A , B ] </m> for the commutator of <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> , but i 'd also like to write <m> [ A , B ] </m> for the lie bracket of <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> . obviously , because the commutator and the lie bracket are not equal , i ca n't do both . is there a well-established standard about what the symbol <m> [ A , B ] </m> means in this context ? -LRB- note : dirac , in his papers on quantum mechanics , uses <m> [ A , B ] </m> to mean the lie bracket , not the commutator . but i do n't want to assume that the notation used by physicists in the 1930s is standard among mathematicians in the 21st century . -RRB-
on a summer school for undergraduate and graduate students okounkov gave the following exercise -LRB- without hints -RRB- : prove that the hilbert scheme of points on <m> \mathbb C ^ 2 </m> is smooth . only a definition of the scheme was given . i do n't really understand how to solve this exercise . i remember beauville was saying in his course on a school at lac de garde -LRB- while he was commenting page 14 here : http://math1.unice.fr/~beauvill/conf/lacgarde2.pdf -RRB- , that he is not aware of an elementary proof of the fact that the hilbert scheme of points on a smooth surface is smooth -LRB- a standard proof uses <m> E x t </m> groups -RRB- . so i would like to know , who is right , okounkov or beauville ? -LRB- or maybe both ? ... -RRB-
i am looking for a comment , reference , remark , or proof of three conjectures as follows : conjecture 1 : let <m> x </m> be an odd positive integer . then there exist two integers <m> n , m \ge 2 </m> so that <m> x = P _ { n + m } - P _ n - P _ m , </m> where <m> P _ n </m> is the <m> n ^ { t h } </m> prime .
if <m> n </m> is composite , then <m> \phi ( n ) < n - 1 </m> : hence , there is at least one number <m> d </m> which does not divide <m> \phi ( n ) </m> but divides <m> ( n - 1 ) </m> . we shall call <m> d </m> the totient divisor of <m> n </m> . the purist will say that totient non-divisor is a more appropriate name but for the sake of simplicity we shall stay with totient divisor . let <m> \tau ( n ) </m> be the number of totient divisors of <m> n </m> , i.e. , <m> \tau ( n ) = \# \{ d : d \mid ( n - 1 ) , \ d \nmid \phi ( n ) \} . </m> trivially , if <m> p </m> is a prime then , <m> \tau ( p ) = 0 </m> and <m> \tau ( p + 1 ) = 1 </m> . i observed the following congruences and i am looking for a proof or disproof of them : <m> \tau ( 4 n + 3 ) \equiv 0 ( \textrm { m o d } \ 2 ) </m> <m> \tau ( 8 n + 5 ) \equiv 0 ( \textrm { m o d } \ 3 ) </m> motivation : notice the resemblance between the above congruences and ramanujan 's partition congruences <m> p ( 5 n + 4 ) \equiv 0 ( \textrm { m o d } \ 5 ) </m> <m> p ( 7 n + 5 ) \equiv 0 ( \textrm { m o d } \ 7 ) </m> <m> p ( 1 1 n + 6 ) \equiv 0 ( \textrm { m o d } \ 1 1 ) </m> note : this may be related to another question on totient divisors .

let <m> M </m> be a smooth manifold of dimension <m> \ge 3 </m> , equipped with a conformal structure -LRB- or a riemannian metric -RRB- . then , the group of conformal diffeomorphisms is a finite dimensional lie group . a proof of this theorem can be found in `` transformation groups in differential geometry '' by kobayashi -LRB- theorem 6.1 , pg 143 -RRB- .
i thank j.c. and arturo magidin for interesting suggestions in the comments to this question in this post the field of rational numbers is denoted by <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> . the space of polynomials with rational coefficients is denoted by <m> \mathbb { Q } [ x ] </m> . the commutator subgroup of a group <m> G </m> is denoted by <m> G ' </m> . the isomorphism between two groups is denoted by <m> \simeq </m> we learn from the answer to the following question
let <m> G \subset \mathrm { S U } ( 2 ) </m> be a finite group . -LRB- these are famously classified through the mckay correspondence . -RRB- the lie group framing of <m> \mathrm { S U } ( 2 ) = S ^ 3 </m> descends to the quotient manifold <m> S ^ 3 / G </m> , at least after getting some `` left `` s and `` right `` s in the correct places . every framed <m> k </m> - manifold determines a class in the <m> k </m> th stable homotopy group of spheres <m> \pi _ k ( \text { S p h e r e } ) </m> . for example , <m> \mathrm { S U } ( 2 ) </m> with its lie group framing provides a generator of <m> \pi _ 3 ( \text { S p h e r e } ) = \mathbb { Z } / 2 4 </m> . what are the values of the homotopy-group classes determined by the framed 3-manifolds <m> S ^ 3 / G </m> ? how do these values relate to other lie theoretic data like the rank or -LRB- dual -RRB- coxeter number of the ade dynkin diagram ?

a well known result -LRB- stated and credited to todorcevic in `` semiselective coideals '' , by farah , mathematika , 1997 , but with antecedents going back to mathias -RRB- says that , under the appropriate large cardinal hypothesis -LRB- enough to get all sets of reals in <m> L ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> to be universally baire , say -RRB- , a selective ultrafilter is <m> L ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> - generic for <m> ( [ \omega ] ^ \omega , \subseteq ^ * ) </m> . it is also well-known that selective ultrafilters need not exist ; kunen showed that they are destroyed by iterating random forcing over a model of ch . more generally , miller showed that <m> Q </m> - points are destroyed by iterating laver -LRB- or mathias -RRB- forcing , and shelah produced a model without <m> P </m> - points . here 's my -LRB- admittedly broad -RRB- question :
i 've been having trouble with finding the curvature computations of globally symmetric spaces of rank <m> 1 </m> . more specifically , i need to use results about the eigenvalues of the operator <m> R : T _ p M \rightarrow T _ p M </m> ; <m> X \mapsto - [ [ X , c ] , c ] </m> for a given <m> c \in T _ p M </m> . the fact is , using the book of besse `` manifolds all of whose geodesics are closed '' , it seems some eigenvalues are <m> - 4 </m> , but the results used in `` the free loop space of globally symmetric spaces '' imply eigenvalues <m> \frac { 1 } { 4 } </m> . i think i 'm computing something wrong , but i do n't know where to find the right computations done explicitly . any reference ?
one may show that the wiener measure -LRB- for curves in <m> \mathbb R ^ n </m> -RRB- is concentrated on the hölder-continuous curves of hölder index <m> < \frac 1 2 </m> . what happens to the curves of hölder index precisely <m> \frac 1 2 </m> , are they wiener-null ?

gauduchon showed that every conformal hermitian structure on a compact complex <m> n </m> - fold contains an hermitian metric such that the associated 1,1-form <m> \omega </m> satisfies <m> \partial { \bar { \partial } } \omega ^ { n - 1 } = 0 </m> . such metrics are called gauduchon metrics . popovici defines a strongly gauduchon metric as a gauduchon metric such that <m> \partial \omega ^ { n - 1 } </m> is <m> { \bar { \partial } } </m> - exact . for <m> n > 2 </m> , what are the known examples of compact complex <m> n </m> - folds that do not admit a strongly gauduchon metric ?

let <m> S </m> be the polynomial ring <m> k [ x _ 0 , \ldots , x _ n ] </m> , <m> x </m> one of the variables <m> x _ i </m> , <m> I \subseteq S </m> a homogeneous ideal which has a generating set <m> f _ 1 , \ldots , f _ r </m> where <m> \deg _ x f _ i = 0 </m> for all <m> i </m> . from the short exact sequence <m> 0 \to S / I ( - 1 ) \xrightarrow { f } S / I \to S / ( x , I ) \to 0 </m> where the first map <m> f </m> is multiplication with x and the second sends <m> s + I </m> to <m> s + ( x , I ) </m> , i get the long exact sequence <m> 0 \to H o m ( S / ( x , I ) , S ) \to H o m ( S / I , S ) \to H o m ( S / I ( - 1 ) , S ) \to \ldots </m> <m> \to E x t ^ { m - 1 } ( S / ( x , I ) , S ) \to E x t ^ { m - 1 } ( S / I , S ) \xrightarrow { f ^ * } E x t ^ { m - 1 } ( S / I ( - 1 ) , S ) \to E x t ^ m ( S / ( x , I ) , S ) \to \ldots </m> my aim is to show that <m> E x t ^ m ( S / ( x , I ) , S ) = \frac { E x t ^ { m - 1 } ( S / I , S ) } { ( x ) E x t ^ { m - 1 } ( S / I , S ) } , </m> so i thought to get there by showing that the induced map <m> f ^ \star </m> in the above sequence is injective or equivalently : if <m> J ^ \bullet </m> is an injective resolution of <m> S </m> with boundaries <m> d ^ m </m> and <m> \varphi \in H o m ( S / I , J ^ m ) </m> with <m> d ^ m _ \star ( \varphi ) = 0 </m> and <m> f ^ \star ( \varphi ) \in d ^ { m - 1 } _ \star ( H o m ( S / I ( - 1 ) , J ^ { m - 1 } ) ) , </m> then is <m> \varphi \in d ^ { m - 1 } _ \star ( H o m ( S / I , J ^ { m - 1 } ) ) </m> . is it true that <m> f ^ \star </m> on the ext-modules is an injection ? and if yes , how can i show that ? thanks for any help !
so my question refers to families of elliptic curves over the <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 1 _ \mathbb { C } \setminus \{ 0 , 1 7 2 8 \} </m> whose fiber above a point <m> j </m> has <m> j </m> - invariant equal to <m> j </m> -LRB- i understand it 's not universal -RRB- . some sources give an equation for such a family , namely <m> E _ 1 : = y ^ 2 + x y = x ^ 3 - \frac { 3 6 } { j - 1 7 2 8 } x - \frac { 1 } { j - 1 7 2 8 } </m>
is it known wether any ultraproduct of <m> \mathcal { O } _ { 2 } </m> , regarding an ultrafilter on <m> \mathbb { N } </m> , is still nuclear or not ? thank you all ! -LRB- references for this would be very much appreciated -RRB-
let <m> A ^ \ast </m> be an algebraic oriented cohomology theory -LRB- i.e. it is equipped with certain push-forwards for projective morphisms of smooth varieties over the base field <m> k </m> ; see section 2 of http://www.math.uiuc.edu/k-theory/0535/orient.pdf for more detail -RRB- ; let <m> f : Y \to X </m> be a finite morphism of smooth varieties whose degree is <m> d </m> . i would like to prove the following conjecture : if <m> f ^ \ast h = 0 </m> for <m> h \in A ^ \ast ( X ) </m> , then <m> d ^ l h = 0 </m> for some <m> l > 0 </m> -LRB- one can not take <m> l = 1 </m> here when <m> A ^ * </m> is the k-theory -RRB- . to this end it suffices to verify that <m> f _ \ast 1 _ Y - d </m> is nilpotent in <m> A ^ 0 ( X ) </m> -LRB- since <m> f _ \ast f ^ \ast h = f _ \ast 1 _ Y \cdot h </m> by the property -LRB- v -RRB- in the reference cited -RRB- . it seems sufficient to prove the latter for <m> A ^ \ast </m> being the algebraic cobordism -LRB- as defined by levine and morel -RRB- , since this is the universal algebraic oriented cohomology theory . i would like to say that <m> f _ \ast 1 _ Y - d </m> is supported in codimension 1 . does <m> A ^ 0 ( X ) </m> possess a multiplicative coniveau filtration ? if <m> f </m> is generically etale , then i can use the fact that <m> f ' _ { * } 1 _ { Y ' } = d </m> for <m> f ' : Y ' \to X ' </m> being the -LRB- etale -RRB- morphism of generic points ; levine proves this in his cobordism book . is there a better way to prove my conjecture -LRB- that would work even if <m> f </m> is not generically etale -RRB- ?
let <m> R </m> be a ring and <m> R ( ( x ) ) </m> the ring of formal laurent series . the elements in the ring <m> R ( ( x ) ) </m> are series of the form <m> f = \sum _ { n \in \mathbb { Z } } a _ n x ^ n , </m> where <m> { \displaystyle a _ { n } = 0 } </m> for all but finitely many negative indices <m> n </m> . the spectrum of a ring is the set of all prime ideals of in the ring . what is the spectrum of <m> R ( ( x ) ) </m> ? thank you very much . edit : assume that <m> R </m> is a field .
are the moduli spaces <m> \mathcal M _ { g , n } </m> expected to be anabelian ? is there anything known in that direction ? thank you very much for your help in any case !
consider the lichnerowicz operator acting on symmetric traceless tensors on an even sphere <m> S ^ d </m> with conical defect parametrized by angular deficit <m> \alpha </m> . is there a simple way to understand/predict the <m> \alpha </m> dependence of the spectral <m> \zeta _ \alpha ( 0 ) </m> ? there are general polyakov formulas for conformal transformation of <m> \zeta _ \alpha ' ( z ) </m> in <m> z = 0 </m> , but <m> \zeta _ \alpha ( 0 ) </m> in this restricted case should be simple -LRB- r -RRB- although varying <m> \alpha </m> is not conformal .
let <m> G </m> be a finite group and <m> K </m> be a group of order <m> 8 </m> . suppose that <m> G / K \cong M _ { 1 2 } </m> where <m> M _ { 1 2 } </m> is one of the mathieu groups . question : how to calculate the all complex character degrees of <m> G </m> ?
assuming the axiom of choice the following argument is simple , for infinite <m> A </m> it holds : <m> 2 \lt A \leq 2 ^ A \implies 2 ^ A \leq A ^ A \leq 2 ^ { A \times A } = 2 ^ A . </m> however without the axiom of choice this does n't have to be true anymore . for example if <m> A </m> is an amorphous set -LRB- infinite set that can not be written as a disjoint union of two infinite sets -RRB- , then it is actually true that <m> 2 ^ A < 3 ^ A < 4 ^ A < \ldots < A ^ A </m> . the reason these inequalities hold is that <m> A ^ A </m> is actually dedekind-finite , so whenever we remove elements we strictly decrease in cardinality . of course there are still sets that obey the equation <m> A ^ A = 2 ^ A </m> , even if <m> A </m> can not be well-ordered . for example given any set <m> A </m> it is not hard to verify that <m> A ^ \omega </m> has the property <m> A ^ \omega \times A ^ \omega = A ^ \omega </m> . from this follows : <m> 2 \lt A ^ \omega \leq 2 ^ { A ^ \omega } \implies 2 ^ { A ^ \omega } \leq \left ( A ^ \omega \right ) ^ { A ^ \omega } \leq \left ( 2 ^ { A ^ \omega } \right ) ^ { A ^ \omega } = 2 ^ { A ^ \omega } </m> -LRB- in fact we can replace <m> \omega </m> by any set <m> \tau </m> such that <m> \tau + \tau = \tau </m> -RRB- but i have a hard time to believe that these two things are equivalent : <m> A ^ A = 2 ^ A \iff A \times A = A . </m>
suppose that <m> X </m> be a compact space and <m> \left | \cdot \right | </m> be an algebra norm on <m> C ( X ) </m>
i have a particular kind of algebraic structure that 's come up in my work . it 's basically a chain complex equipped with a multiplication which is commutative and associative up to homotopy in a particularly nice way . so one might hope that it 's some variation of an <m> E _ \infty </m> - algebra . unfortunately i can not see a direct relation between the two notions . fix a ground ring <m> R </m> . -LRB- everything below will make sense more generally than for <m> R </m> - modules , though . -RRB- let <m> A </m> be a left module over the commutative operad , a.k.a. a twisted commutative algebra , in the category of dg <m> R </m> - modules . we suppose that <m> A ( 0 ) = 0 </m> . to be explicit , this means that i have a sequence <m> \{ A ( n ) \} _ { n \geq 1 } </m> of chain complexes over <m> R </m> with actions of the symmetric groups <m> S _ n </m> , and a multiplication map <m> A ( m ) \otimes A ( n ) \to A ( m + n ) </m> which is <m> S _ m \times S _ n </m> - equivariant . i impose also the condition that the multiplication is associative , and that it 's commutative in a `` twisted '' sense , meaning that the diagram <m> A ( m ) \otimes A ( n ) \to A ( m + n ) </m> <m> \cong \hspace { 6 e m } \cong </m> <m> A ( n ) \otimes A ( m ) \to A ( n + m ) </m> commutes . here the left vertical isomorphism is the `` flip '' map , and the right isomorphism is acting by the `` box '' permutation <m> ( n + 1 , n + 2 , . . . , n + m , 1 , 2 , \ldots , n ) </m> . so far i 'm only repeating standard definitions . let me define <m> A </m> to be a homotopy twisted commutative algebra if it is moreover equipped with an element <m> \mathbf 1 \in A ( 1 ) </m> such that multiplication with <m> \mathbf 1 </m> induces a quasi-isomorphism <m> A ( n ) \to A ( n + 1 ) </m> for all <m> n </m> . example . if <m> C </m> is a unital commutative algebra over <m> R </m> in the usual sense , then if i put <m> A ( n ) = C </m> with trivial <m> S _ n </m> - action , with multiplication given by the usual multiplication in <m> C </m> , then i obtain a rather trivial example of a homotopy twisted commutative algebra . claim . if <m> A </m> has vanishing differential , then it is necessarily of the form of the previous example . indeed multiplication by <m> \mathbf 1 </m> gives me isomorphisms <m> A ( n ) \cong A ( n + 1 ) </m> which i can use the to identify all the different components ; one can prove that under these isomorphisms , the multiplication <m> A ( 1 ) \otimes A ( 1 ) \to A ( 2 ) \cong A ( 1 ) </m> becomes on-the-nose commutative and associative . so in general a homotopy twisted commutative algebra will on the level of cohomology give me a strictly commutative multiplication . but on the chain level i have something weaker . if i choose a quasi-inverse <m> A ( 2 ) \stackrel \sim \to A ( 1 ) </m> i get a multiplication on <m> A ( 1 ) </m> , but now it is only commutative and associative up to homotopy . question : is there a relationship between homotopy twisted commutative algebras and <m> E _ \infty </m> - algebras ? for example , is there a functor from one of them to the other ? a quillen equivalence ?
please let me know whether this question is suitable for mathoverflow . let <m> E </m> be a finite holomorphic vector bundle -LRB- or more generally a coherent analytic sheaf -RRB- on a compact complex manifold <m> X </m> . by the cartan-serre finiteness theorem , the cohomology <m> H ^ q ( X , E ) </m> is a finite dimensional vector space for any <m> q </m> , and in particular the space of global sections <m> \Gamma ( X , E ) = H ^ 0 ( X , E ) </m> is finite dimensional . the proof is based on hodge theory or properties of frechet spaces .
the balog-szemerédi-gowers theorem can be stated in the following form : let <m> A , B </m> be subsets of <m> \mathbb { Z } / n \mathbb { Z } </m> -LRB- say -RRB- with equal cardinality , such that <m> \| 1 _ A * 1 _ B \| _ 2 \ge K ^ { - 1 } \| 1 _ A \| _ 1 \| 1 _ B \| _ 2 . </m> then there exist <m> A ' \subset A </m> , <m> B ' \subset B </m> with <m> | A ' | \ge K ^ { - C } | A | </m> , <m> | B ' | \ge K ^ { - C } | B | </m> such that <m> | A ' + B ' | \le K ^ C | B ' | </m> . here <m> C </m> is an absolute constant . my questions is : what happens if the <m> 2 </m> - norm is replaced by a <m> q </m> - norm ? if <m> q \in ( 1 , 2 ) </m> , then it follows from hölder that <m> \| 1 _ A * 1 _ B \| _ q \ge K ^ { - 1 } \| 1 _ A \| _ 1 \| 1 _ B \| _ q </m> implies <m> \| 1 _ A * 1 _ B \| _ 2 \ge K ^ { - \frac { q } { 2 ( q - 1 ) } } \| 1 _ A \| _ 1 \| 1 _ B \| _ 2 , </m> so the conclusion still holds , with a constant <m> C </m> that depends on <m> q </m> -LRB- blowing up as <m> q \downarrow 1 </m> -RRB- . what about <m> q > 2 </m> ? more precisely :
let <m> T </m> be a given turing machine . we say that <m> T </m> decides <m> \operatorname { C o n } ( P A ) </m> if <m> P A + \operatorname { C o n } ( P A ) \vdash T \text { a c c e p t s } </m> and <m> P A + \lnot \operatorname { C o n } ( P A ) \vdash T \text { r e j e c t s } </m> -LRB- in any case , <m> P A \vdash T \text { h a l t s } </m> by cases -RRB- . what is the minimal turing degree -LRB- s -RRB- that allows such a <m> T </m> to exist ? it is clear that is <m> \le 0 ' </m> . simply ask the oracle `` does the machine that looks for the <m> n </m> encoding <m> P A \vdash 0 = 1 </m> halt ? '' . i do not think <m> 0 ' </m> is the lowest such degree though .
suppose we have a domain <m> \Omega \subset \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> which is homeomorrphic to the unit ball <m> B ( 0 , 1 ) \subset \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> and such that <m> \partial \Omega </m> is of class <m> C ^ 1 </m> -LRB- technically , this means that for every point in the domain we can give a <m> C ^ 1 </m> - diffeomorphism to the half-space in dimension <m> n </m> -RRB- . a map <m> f \colon ( X , d _ X ) \to ( Y , d _ Y ) </m> between metric spaces is said to be bi-lipschitz if there is a constant <m> K > 0 </m> such that <m> \frac { 1 } { K } d _ X ( x _ 1 , x _ 2 ) \leq d _ Y ( f ( x _ 1 ) , f ( x _ 2 ) ) \leq K d _ X ( x _ 1 , x _ 2 ) </m> for all <m> x \in X </m> . the spaces <m> X </m> and <m> Y </m> are said to be lipschitz equivalent if there is a surjective bi-lipschitz map between them -LRB- any bi-lipschitz map is necessarily injective -RRB- . i wonder if in this case the domain <m> \Omega \subset \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> is lipschitz equivalent to the unit ball <m> B ( 0 , 1 ) \subset \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> . if true , is the condition <m> C ^ 1 </m> necessary , sufficient ? edit : my original question did not assume that the domain was homeomorphic to the ball . however , in this case it is clearly false , so i added this condition .
setup this question is a followup on this question . i 'm interested in the asymptotic distribution of certain quadratic forms . so , let <m> Z </m> be a <m> p </m> - dimensional random vector with -LRB- unknown -RRB- distribution <m> P </m> . consider a mapping <m> g : \mathbb R ^ q \times \mathbb R ^ p \rightarrow \mathbb R ^ k </m> . let <m> \theta ^ * \in \mathbb R ^ p </m> satisfy <m> \mathbb E _ P [ g ( Z ; \theta ^ * ) ] = 0 _ k </m> . question 1 under very general regularity conditions on <m> g </m> , what can be said about the asymptotic distribution of the -LRB- random -RRB- scalar quantity <m> \alpha _ n ( \theta ) : = n \mathbb E _ { \hat { P } _ n } [ g ( Z ; \theta ) ] ^ T \operatorname { C o v } _ { \hat { P } _ n } [ g ( Z ; \theta ) ] ^ { - 1 } \mathbb E _ { \hat { P } _ n } [ g ( Z ; \theta ) ] ? </m> here , <m> \mathbb E _ { \hat { P } _ n } [ g ( Z ; \theta ) ] = ( 1 / n ) \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n g ( z _ i ; \theta ) \in \mathbb R ^ k </m> is the empirical mean of the random vector <m> g ( Z ; \theta ) </m> from an i.i.d sample <m> z _ 1 , \ldots , z _ n \sim P </m> , and <m> \operatorname { C o v } _ { \hat { P } _ n } [ g ( Z ; \theta ) ] \in \mathbb R ^ { k \times k } </m> is the empirical covariance matrix . question 2 : specialization to mle same question with <m> g ( Z ; \theta ) : = - \partial _ \theta \log p _ \theta ( Z ) </m> , the score function for a parametric family of distributions -LRB- densities thereof -RRB- <m> \{ p _ \theta \} </m> , assumed to contain the true distribution of <m> Z </m> , namely <m> P </m> . question 3 : specialization to location parameter estimation same question with <m> g ( Z ; \theta ) = Z - \theta </m> . observations my wild guesses are
definition 1 . a compactification <m> c \mathbb N </m> of the discrete space <m> \mathbb N </m> is called soft if for any disjoint sets <m> A , B \subset \mathbb N </m> with <m> \bar A \cap \bar B \ne \emptyset </m> there exists a homeomorphism <m> h : c \mathbb N \to c \mathbb N </m> such that <m> h ( x ) = x </m> for all <m> x \in c \mathbb N \setminus \mathbb N </m> and the set <m> \{ x \in A : h ( x ) \in B \} </m> is infinite . definition 2 . a compact hausdorff space <m> X </m> is called parovichenko -LRB- resp . soft parovichenko -RRB- if <m> X </m> is homeomorphic to the remainder <m> c \mathbb N \setminus \mathbb N </m> of some -LRB- soft -RRB- compactification <m> c \mathbb N </m> of <m> \mathbb N </m> ? remark 1 . by a classical parovichenko theorem , each compact hausdorff space of weight <m> \le \aleph _ 1 </m> is parovichenko . hence , under ch a compact hausdorff space is parovichenko if and only if it has weight <m> \le \mathfrak c </m> . by a result of przymusinski , each perfectly normal compact space is parovichenko . on the other hand , bell constructed an consistent example of a first-countable compact hausdorff space , which is not parovichenko . more information and references on parovichenko spaces can be found in this survey of hart and van mill -LRB- see <m> \S </m> 3.10 -RRB- ,

it is a well known fact that the irreducible representations of <m> S L _ 2 ( \mathbb { F } _ p ) </m> over <m> \overline { \mathbb { F _ p } } </m> are given by the symmetric powers <m> S y m m ^ k ( V ) </m> , where <m> V = \overline { \mathbb { F } _ p } ^ 2 </m> , for <m> k </m> ranging in <m> 0 , \ldots , p - 1 </m> . in the case of <m> G L _ 2 ( \mathbb { F } _ p ) </m> irreducible representations are exhausted by : <m> \sigma _ { k , n } = S y m m ^ k ( V ) \otimes d e t ^ n </m>

let <m> k </m> be a finite extension of <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> and let <m> G </m> be a semisimple lie group over <m> k </m> . we consider the action of <m> G </m> on its bruhat-tits building <m> X </m> . question : if <m> x , y , x ' , y ' </m> are vertices , all of the same type , and <m> d ( x , y ) = d ( x ' , y ' ) </m> , is there a <m> g \in G </m> with <m> g x = x ' </m> and <m> g y = y ' </m> ?
it is known that the somos - <m> k </m> sequences for <m> k \ge 8 </m> do not give integers . but the first terms of somos-8 sequence <m> s _ n = a _ n / b _ n </m> <m> 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 4 , 7 , 1 3 , 2 5 , 6 1 , 1 8 7 , 7 7 5 , 5 8 2 7 , 1 4 8 1 5 , \frac { 4 2 0 5 1 4 } { 7 } , \frac { 2 8 6 7 0 7 7 3 } { 9 1 } </m> defined by <m> s _ 1 = s _ 2 = s _ 3 = s _ 4 = s _ 5 = s _ 6 = s _ 7 = s _ 8 = 1 </m> , <m> s _ { n + 8 } s _ n = s _ { n + 7 } s _ { n + 1 } + s _ { n + 6 } s _ { n + 2 } + s _ { n + 5 } s _ { n + 3 } + s _ { n + 4 } ^ 2 \qquad ( n \ge 1 ) </m> have only odd denominators <m> b _ n </m> . morever <m> s _ n </m> has even numerator <m> a _ n </m> only for <m> n = 9 k </m> . it was checked for <m> n \le 6 7 </m> . first terms of <m> s _ n \mod 8 : = a _ n \cdot b _ n ^ { - 1 } \mod 8 </m> are <m> \begin {array} { l } 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , { \bf 4 } , \\ 7 , 5 , 1 , 5 , 3 , 7 , 3 , 7 , { \bf 6 } , \\ 7 , 7 , 5 , 7 , 5 , 3 , 1 , 1 , { \bf 6 } , \\ 5 , 1 , 5 , 5 , 3 , 3 , 7 , 1 , { \bf 4 } , \\ 7 , 7 , 3 , 3 , 7 , 7 , 3 , 1 , { \bf 2 } , \\ 1 , 3 , 1 , 3 , 7 , 5 , 3 , 5 , { \bf 2 } , \\ 5 , 7 , 3 , 7 , 7 , 3 , 7 , 3 , { \bf 0 } , \\ 1 , 3 , 7 , 3 , \ldots \end {array} </m> is it possible to prove that the sequence <m> s _ n \mod 2 </m> is periodic ? edt . it was found by მამუკა ჯიბლაძე that numerator of <m> s _ { 7 1 } </m> is even while that of <m> s _ { 7 2 } </m> is odd . the last line of the table above is <m> 1 , 3 , 7 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 1 , { \bf 2 } , 5 </m> so the conjecture about numerators of <m> s _ n </m> is wrong . but the qustion about periodicity is still valid .
as is known -LRB- see kadison-ringrose , 3.4.1 -RRB- each closed ideal <m> I </m> in the <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra <m> C ( X ) </m> of continuous functions on a compact space <m> X </m> has the form <m> I = \{ f \in C ( X ) : \ \forall x \in S \quad f ( x ) = 0 \} </m> for some closed subset <m> S </m> in <m> X </m> .
for some research work , i need to know the classification of elements of finite order of <m> \mathrm { P G L } ( n , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> , up to conjugation . since i essentially need <m> n \le 4 </m> , i think that i can show it by hand , using cyclotomic extensions and galois theory , but is there some work in the literature on this ? edit : looking at the possible orders is essentially trivial in <m> \mathrm { G L } ( n , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> , by just looking at the cyclotomic polynomials . the conjugacy classes require a little more work but are easy exercises , at least in low dimension . for <m> \mathrm { P G L } ( n , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> , the case of orders prime to <m> n </m> follows essentially from the case of <m> \mathrm { G L } ( n , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> , the orders are more interesting .
i employ the vast majority of the post to develop the notion of quasi-functor between dg-categories : i think it is important to get the idea . let <m> k </m> be a field , and let <m> \mathcal V = \mathbf C ( k ) </m> be the category of cochain complexes of <m> k </m> - vector spaces and chain maps . <m> \mathcal V </m> is a symmetric closed monoidal category , and also has a structure of model category -LRB- the weak equivalences are the quasi-isomorphisms , the fibrations are the surjective chain maps -RRB- . categories enriched over <m> \mathcal V </m> are called dg-categories . <m> \mathcal V </m> is also enriched over itself . let <m> \mathcal A , \mathcal B </m> be categories enriched over <m> \mathcal V </m> . the category <m> \mathrm { F u n } _ { \mathcal V } ( \mathcal A , \mathcal B ) </m> of <m> \mathcal V </m> - functors and <m> \mathcal V </m> - natural transformations is also enriched over <m> \mathcal V </m> . the -LRB- enriched -RRB- yoneda lemma holds , and we have the -LRB- fully faithful -RRB- yoneda embedding : <m> \mathcal A \hookrightarrow \textrm { m o d - } \mathcal A = : \mathrm { F u n } _ { \mathcal V } ( \mathcal A ^ { \mathrm { o p } } , \mathcal V ) . </m> the category <m> \textrm { m o d - } \mathcal A </m> of -LRB- right -RRB- <m> \mathcal A </m> - modules inherits a -LRB- levelwise -RRB- model structure from <m> \mathcal V </m> : for example , quasi-equivalences are given by levelwise quasi-equivalences . now , let me give the following definition : given <m> \mathcal A , \mathcal B </m> two <m> \mathcal V </m> - categories , a <m> \mathcal V </m> - functor <m> F : \mathcal A \to \textrm { m o d - } \mathcal B </m> is called a quasi-functor if for any <m> A \in \mathcal A </m> , <m> F ( A ) </m> is isomorphic to a representable right <m> \mathcal B </m> - module in the homotopy category <m> \mathrm { H o } ( \text { m o d - } \mathcal B ) </m> . now , observe that we can define a `` tensor product '' <m> \mathcal A \otimes \mathcal B </m> of <m> \mathcal V </m> - categories . moreover , <m> \mathcal V </m> - functors <m> \mathcal A \otimes \mathcal B ^ { \mathrm { o p } } \to \mathcal V </m> correspond exactly to <m> \mathcal V </m> - functors <m> \mathcal A \to \textrm { m o d - } \mathcal B </m> . they are precisely the bimodules -LRB- or profunctors -RRB- . let me denote by <m> \mathcal A \text { - m o d - } \mathcal B </m> the <m> \mathcal V </m> - category of bimodules -LRB- covariant in <m> \mathcal A </m> , contravariant in <m> \mathcal B </m> -RRB- . since it is a category of modules , it is a model category , with the levelwise structure discussed above . now , i can define <m> \mathrm { r e p } ( \mathcal A , \mathcal B ) </m> as the full subcategory of <m> \mathrm { H o } ( \mathcal A \text { - m o d - } \mathcal B ) </m> whose objects are the quasi-functors . moreover , i can define <m> \mathrm { r e p } _ { \mathcal V } ( \mathcal A , \mathcal B ) </m> as the full <m> \mathcal V </m> - subcategory of <m> \mathcal A \text { - m o d - } \mathcal B </m> whose objects are the quasi-functors which are also cofibrant as bimodules . where can we go from here ? well , the category <m> \mathcal V </m> - <m> \mathbf { C a t } </m> of categories enriched over <m> \mathcal V </m> has itself a model structure : it is a known result by g. tabuada about dg-categories , more recently generalized . the homotopy category <m> \mathrm { H o } ( \mathcal V \text { - } \mathbf { C a t } ) </m> is monoidal , and <m> \mathrm { r e p } _ { \mathcal V } ( \mathcal A , \mathcal B ) </m> gives the internal hom . in the world of dg-categories , <m> \mathrm { r e p } ( \mathcal A , \mathcal B ) </m> is -LRB- equivalent to -RRB- <m> H ^ 0 ( \mathrm { r e p } _ { \mathcal V } ( \mathcal A , \mathcal B ) ) </m> . finally , here is my question : generalize from this particular case <m> \mathcal V = \mathbf C ( k ) </m> to a more general setting , possibly letting <m> \mathcal V </m> be a monoidal model category -LRB- with some assumptions -RRB- . every definition given above should work without problems . has someone developed a `` general theory '' of those quasi-functors ? i 've studied it in the case of dg-categories , but i guess it is just a particular case .
let <m> \Gamma = ( M , W , K ) </m> be a bipartite graph , that is <m> M , W </m> are sets and <m> K \subseteq M \times W </m> . if there is an injective function <m> f : M \to W </m> such that <m> f \subseteq K </m> we say <m> f </m> is an espousal and <m> \Gamma </m> is espousable . moreover , <m> \Gamma </m> is critical , if it is espousable , and every espousal is surjective . for a bipartite graph <m> \Gamma = ( M , W , K ) </m> and <m> A \subseteq M </m> we set <m> W [ A ] = \{ w \in W : ( \exists m \in A ) : ( m , w ) \in K \} </m> . we also set <m> \Gamma | _ A = ( A , W [ A ] , K \cap ( A \times W [ A ] ) </m> if <m> \kappa </m> is a cardinal then we say that <m> \Gamma = ( M , W , K ) </m> is a <m> \kappa </m> - impediment if there is a subset <m> A \subseteq M </m> with <m> | A | = \kappa </m> and <m> \Gamma | _ { M \setminus A } </m> is critical . question : let <m> \Gamma = ( M , W , K ) </m> be a 1-impediment and let <m> M </m> be partitioned into <m> M _ 1 \cup M _ 2 </m> and <m> W </m> be partitioned into <m> W _ 1 \cup W _ 2 </m> . is it true that at least one of <m> ( M _ i , W _ i , K \cap ( M _ i \times W _ i ) ) </m> contains a <m> \kappa </m> - impediment for <m> \kappa \leq \aleph _ 0 </m> ?

i recently asked this question on math.stackexchange with no answer so far . so i thought maybe i can find an answer here . let <m> M ( k , \Gamma _ 0 ( N ) ) </m> be a space of modular forms of weight <m> k </m> on <m> \Gamma _ 0 ( N ) </m> . each <m> f \in M ( k , \Gamma _ 0 ( N ) ) </m> has a fourier expansion of the form <m> f ( \tau ) = \sum _ { n \in \mathbb { N } } a ( n ) \, q ^ n \quad \text { w h e r e } \quad q = \mathrm { e } ^ { 2 \pi \mathrm { i } \tau } . </m> now , let <m> g ( \tau ) </m> be a function obtained from <m> f ( \tau ) </m> by omitting all <m> a ( n ) </m> such that <m> \gcd ( n , N ) \neq 1 </m> , i.e. <m> g ( \tau ) = \sum _ { \substack { n \in \mathbb { N } \, ( n , N ) = 1 } } a ( n ) \, q ^ n . </m> question : is <m> g ( \tau ) </m> a modular form ? what is its level ? many thanks .
let <m> d _ 1 < d _ 2 < \dots < d _ k </m> be integers . then the number of integers <m> n \leq x </m> , such that <m> n + d _ 1 , n + d _ 2 , \ldots , n + d _ k </m> are simultaneously prime , is bounded above by <m> \mathfrak { S } ( d _ 1 , \ldots , d _ k ) ( C k ) ^ k \frac { x } { \log ^ k x } , </m> where <m> \mathfrak { S } ( d _ 1 , \ldots , d _ k ) </m> is a singular series . for <m> k </m> fixed this follows without to much trouble from selberg 's sieve or the large sieve . very precise results of this type are given e.g. in the book by halberstam and richert . however , for my application i need <m> k </m> of order <m> \sqrt { \log \log x } </m> . with some effort the large sieve should still work . however , this question appears so natural that certainly someone already solved this problem . so my first question is : if there a reference for a result as above , which is uniform in <m> k </m> -LRB- at least up to <m> ( \log \log x ) ^ { 1 / 2 + \epsilon } </m> ? the second question is : from which point onward can one replace the factor <m> k ^ k </m> by something like <m> k ^ { o ( k ) } </m> ? i guess that <m> k ^ { k / 2 } </m> would already be pretty difficult , at least for not too large <m> k </m> . third question : when bounding prime <m> k </m> - tuples , for which values of <m> k </m> should one switch from selberg 's sieve to the large sieve , and for which value of <m> k </m> from the large sieve to the larger sieve ? from the work of elsholtz it is clear that the larger sieve is best for <m> k </m> of order <m> \log x </m> , which is probably the right order , but the change between selberg 's sieve and the large sieve appears less clear . jan-christoph schlage-puchta

on page <m> 8 </m> in these slides -LRB- http://www.math.unicaen.fr/~nitaj/latticemalaysia2014-2.pdf -RRB- it is told that if we want to solve <m> x _ 1 a _ 1 + \dots + x _ n a _ n = N </m> where <m> | x _ i | < \frac { 2 ^ { n / 4 } N ^ \frac 1 { n + 1 } } { \sqrt n } </m> holds then we have a polynomial time algorithm for this . -LRB- 1 -RRB- what is the complexity of the algorithm ? is there a reference ? -LRB- 2 -RRB- can we replace <m> | x _ i | < \frac { 2 ^ { n / 4 } N ^ \frac 1 { n + 1 } } { \sqrt n } </m> by <m> 0 \leq x _ i < \frac { 2 ^ { n / 4 } N ^ \frac 1 { n + 1 } } { \sqrt n } </m> ?

let <m> s ( n ) </m> denote the number of distinct crystallographic groups in <m> I s o m ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) </m> . apparently the best known upper bound so far is <m> s ( n ) \le e ^ { e ^ { 4 n ^ 2 } } , </m> given by peter buser in <m> 1 9 8 5 </m> . on the other hand , it is not difficult to see -LRB- using a fixed-point lemma by burnside-cachy -RRB- that the number of <m> n </m> - dimensional crystallographic groups in the arithmetic class of the group of diagonal matrices has the asymptotic value <m> \frac { 2 ^ { n ( n - 1 ) } } { n ! } . </m> this should give a lower bound for <m> s ( n ) </m> . moreover , this class seems to be quite large in general , so that i have the feeling that the upper bound of buser is not yet optimal . what is known about lower and upper bounds for <m> s ( n ) </m> ? is it possible to use some other results on bounds of conjugacy classes of finite groups -LRB- since <m> s ( n ) </m> is related to that by the number of conjugacy classes of finite subgroups of <m> G L ( n , \mathbb { Z } ) </m> -RRB- ? update : are there upper bounds known for the number of <m> n </m> - dimensional bieberbach groups -LRB- torsionfree crystallographic groups -RRB- , better than buser 's bound ?
the following -LRB- very simply looking ! -RRB- problem occurs in regularization of the harmonic series which can be formally thought of as the limit as <m> q \to 1 </m> , <m> | q | < 1 </m> , of <m> h ( q ) : = ( 1 - q ) \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { q ^ n } { 1 - q ^ n } . </m> i can show -LRB- with some effort -RRB- that <m> h ( q ) = - \log ( 1 - q ) + f ( q ) \qquad \text { a s } \quad q \to 1 , \ | q | < 1 , </m> where <m> f ( q ) </m> is a bounded function -LRB- hint : consider both <m> h ( q ) </m> and <m> h ( q ^ 2 ) </m> as <m> q \to 1 </m> -RRB- . the question is whether the function <m> f ( q ) </m> has a limit as <m> q \to 1 </m> or not ; in other words , whether <m> h ( q ) = - \log ( 1 - q ) + c + o ( 1 ) \qquad \text { a s } \quad q \to 1 , \ | q | < 1 . </m> then , of course , i am very much interested in the constant <m> c </m> . a straightforward computer experiment is not helpful .

as far as i know , a real square matrix <m> M </m> has a real square root if <m> M </m> is positive semidefinite , i.e. , if all eigenvalues are nonnegative . and , in fact , its square root is unique . i have read some research papers on how to solve the square root of a <m> 3 \times 3 </m> positive definite matrix using cayley-hamilton , the minimal polynomial , and diagonalization . however , when does a <m> 3 \times 3 </m> integer matrix <m> M </m> have an integer square root ? trivially , <m> M </m> must be positive definite to make sure its square root exists and is real . also , <m> \det ( M ) </m> must be a a perfect square . other than that , i am stuck . please help me with this . or just give me a hint or a lead . thank you .
in proposition 7.6 of his paper `` higher direct images of dualizing sheaves '' , kollár shows that if <m> X , Y </m> are smooth complex projective varieties and <m> f : X \rightarrow Y </m> is a proper surjective morphism with connected fibers , then there is an isomorphism <m> R ^ d f _ { \ast } \omega _ X \simeq \omega _ Y </m> , where <m> d = \dim X - \dim Y </m> . i was wondering whether this is true in positive characteristic . by grothendieck duality one has <m> R f _ { \ast } \mathcal { O } _ X \simeq R f _ { \ast } R \mathcal { H } o m ( \omega _ X ^ { \bullet } , \omega _ X ^ { \bullet } ) \simeq R \mathcal { H } o m ( R f _ { \ast } \omega _ X ^ { \bullet } , \omega _ Y ^ { \bullet } ) [ - d ] </m> so taking 0-th cohomology we get <m> f _ { \ast } \mathcal { O } _ X \simeq \mathcal { E } x t ^ { - d } ( R f _ { \ast } \omega _ X ^ { \bullet } , \omega _ Y ^ { \bullet } ) </m> from the spectral sequence <m> \mathcal { E } x t ^ p ( \mathcal { H } ^ { - q } ( \mathcal { F } ^ { \bullet } ) , \mathcal { G } ^ { \bullet } ) \Longrightarrow \mathcal { E } x t ^ { p + q } ( \mathcal { F } ^ { \bullet } , \mathcal { G } ^ { \bullet } ) </m> it follows that the rhs is isomorphic to <m> \mathcal { H } o m ( R ^ d f _ { \ast } \omega _ X , \omega _ Y ) </m> and the lhs is just <m> \mathcal { O } _ Y </m> by the connected fibers assumption so we have <m> \mathcal { O } _ Y \simeq \mathcal { H } o m ( R ^ d f _ { \ast } \omega _ X , \omega _ Y ) </m> finally since <m> R ^ d f _ { \ast } \omega _ X </m> is locally free we conclude that <m> R ^ d f _ { \ast } \omega _ X \simeq \omega _ Y </m> .
let <m> k </m> a field with <m> c h a r ( k ) = p > 0 </m> , separable closure <m> k ^ { s e p } </m> and <m> f : X \rightarrow Y </m> a smooth projective morphism of smooth variety over <m> k </m> . 1 -RRB- is it true that there exists a -LRB- edit -RRB- dense open susbset <m> U </m> of <m> Y </m> such that <m> R ^ { i } f _ * \mathbb Q _ p </m> is a lisse sheaf over <m> U </m> ? 2 -RRB- assume <m> Y = s p e c ( k ) </m> and <m> k </m> finitely generated . then <m> R ^ { i } f _ { * } \mathbb Q _ p </m> correspond to the representation <m> G a l ( k ^ { s e p } | k ) \rightarrow G L ( H ^ i ( X _ { k ^ { s e p } } , \mathbb Q _ p ) ) </m> . is it possible that this representation is trivial or almost trivial -LRB- edit i.e it has finite image -RRB- ? when specialized to abelian varieties the second question becomes : 2 ' -RRB- is it possible that the action of the absolute galois group of <m> k </m> on the <m> p </m> tate module is trivial or almost trivial ?

it is easy to give examples of non-separable <m> L ^ p </m> spaces by considering a measure on a big space . if one adds the condition that the space has to have total measure 1 , the problem is not as easy . the following equivalences are known , and not very useful :
let <m> x , y </m> be positive integers , such that <m> 3 x ( x ^ 2 + 2 ) = y ^ 2 </m> since <m> 3 \cdot 1 ( 1 ^ 2 + 2 ) = 3 \times 3 = 9 = 3 ^ 2 </m> <m> 3 \cdot 2 ( 2 ^ 2 + 2 ) = 6 \cdot 6 = 3 6 = 6 ^ 2 </m> <m> 2 4 \cdot 3 ( 2 4 ^ 2 + 2 ) = 7 2 \cdot 5 7 8 = 2 0 4 ^ 2 </m> so i have found three solutions <m> ( x , y ) = ( 1 , 3 ) , ( 2 , 6 ) , ( 2 4 , 2 0 4 ) </m> are there any other solutions ?
how many elements of <m> L U </m> decomposition of a symmetric matrix change after adding a sparse symmetric matrix ? is it more efficient to recompute <m> L U </m> decomposition after adding a sparse matrix comparing to computing it from scratch for the sum ? more formally , let <m> M </m> be a symmetric matrix , <m> L _ M \cdot U _ M </m> its pivoted <m> L U </m> decomposition , and <m> N </m> a sparse symmetric matrix of the same dimension . the 1st question was : is it true that <m> M + N </m> has <m> L U </m> decomposition <m> L _ { M + N } \cdot U _ { M + N } </m> such that both <m> L _ { M + N } - L _ M </m> and <m> U _ { M + N } - U _ M </m> are sparse ? the 2nd question : provided that the answer to the 1st question is positive , is it possible to compute <m> L _ { M + N } - L _ M </m> and <m> U _ { M + N } - U _ M </m> asymptotically faster than computing <m> L _ { M + N } </m> and <m> U _ { M + N } </m> without knowledge of <m> L _ M </m> and <m> U _ M </m> would require ?

a finite group acting on a complex vector space of dimension <m> n </m> can be seen as acting on a real vector space of dimension <m> 2 n </m> just by forgetting the complex structure of the space . my question is , if i am handed a real vector space <m> V </m> of dimension <m> 2 n </m> , and a group <m> G </m> acting on it , is there a test i can perform to determine if the action arose from a complex action in this way ? sometimes it is easy to rule out : for example , if <m> G </m> contains anything orientation-reversing , then clearly it does n't arise in this way . or if one knows enough about <m> G </m> -LRB- abstractly as a group -RRB- to know it does n't have any faithful <m> n </m> - dimensional representation . but i would like an if-and-only-if criterion :

let -LRB- e -RRB- be an elliptic curve <m> y ^ 2 = x ^ 3 - x - 1 </m> over <m> \mathbb { F } _ 3 </m> , <m> a _ 0 = 1 </m> , <m> a _ n </m> is the number of positive divisor of degree <m> n \geq 1 </m> . <m> a _ 1 </m> in this case is the number of points of e , i.e. , <m> a _ 1 = 1 </m> only a point <m> \infty </m> . the zeta function <m> Z ( t ) = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } a _ n t ^ n </m> is computable <m> Z ( t ) = \dfrac { 1 - 3 t + 3 t ^ 2 } { ( 1 - t ) ( 1 - 3 t ) } = 1 + t + 4 t ^ 2 + 1 3 t ^ 3 + . . . </m> my question is : what are positive divisors of degree 2 on elliptic curve <m> y ^ 2 = x ^ 3 - x - 1 </m> over <m> \mathbb { F } _ 3 </m> ? is a positive divisor of degree 2 a sum of 2 points of e ? if it is true , i ca n't explain <m> a _ 2 = 4 </m> . thank you for your helps .
let <m> X </m> be a derived stack . there is a <m> S ^ 1 </m> - action on the derived loop space <m> \mathcal { L } ( X ) = \text { M a p s } ( S ^ 1 , X ) </m> . in particular , <m> \mathcal { O } ( \mathcal { L } X ) </m> should be quasi-isomorphic to a mixed complex . i want to consider three specific examples , all over a field of characteristic zero . let <m> G </m> be an affine algebraic group . -LRB- 1 -RRB- a warm-up , where <m> X </m> is a classical scheme -LRB- let 's assume it is smooth and affine to make things easier -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- <m> X = B G </m> , and in particular <m> X = B \mathbb { G } _ a </m> and -LRB- 3 -RRB- <m> X = Y / G </m> where say , <m> G </m> is a reductive and <m> Y </m> is affine -LRB- to make things easier -RRB- . -LRB- edit : i made many edits below , after thinking about this some more -RRB- example 1 : a smooth scheme i want to understand how one obtains the connes <m> B </m> - operator -LRB- via hkr ? -RRB- on functions on the derived loop space of a smooth -LRB- say , affine , to make things simpler -RRB- scheme <m> X </m> from dag first principles -LRB- rather than say , cyclic sets -RRB- . to compute the loop space , we can write <m> S ^ 1 </m> as the homotopy colimit of the simplicial set corresponding to the presentation of <m> S ^ 1 </m> by two simplices -LRB- of dimension zero and one -RRB- . i 'll denote this simplicial set by <m> C </m> , so that we have <m> \mathcal { L } ( X ) = \text { M a p } ( S ^ 1 , X ) \simeq \text { c o l i m } _ C \text { M a p } ( \text { S p e c } ( k ) , X ) \simeq \lim _ { C ^ { o p } } X </m> in particular , if <m> X </m> is affine , one gets the usual hochschild complex . edit : in light of the comment below by marc , it seems likely that some combination of his notes and loday 's book should tell how we obtain connes ' mixed complex . example 2 : <m> B G </m> we have that <m> \mathcal { L } ( B G ) = G / G </m> , and that <m> \mathcal { O } ( G / G ) = k [ G ] ^ G </m> , where the invariants are derived . in particular , <m> \mathcal { O } ( G / G ) </m> is the rational cohomology of the <m> G </m> - representation <m> k [ G ] </m> . if <m> G </m> is reductive , then it has no higher cohomology , so the <m> S ^ 1 </m> - action on this vector space is necessarily trivial . another example : if <m> B </m> is a borel subgroup of a reductive algebraic group , then <m> B / B \simeq \tilde { G } / G </m> . it 's known that the higher cohomology of <m> \tilde { G } </m> vanishes , and since <m> G </m> is reductive taking invariants is exact , so again the <m> S ^ 1 </m> - action is trivial . in search of a less trivial example , let us take <m> G = \mathbb { G } _ a </m> ; then there is some nontrivial group cohomology : <m> \mathcal { O } ( \mathbb { G } _ a / \mathbb { G } _ a ) \simeq C ^ \bullet ( \mathbb { G } _ a k [ \mathbb { G } _ a ] ) \simeq k [ x , \eta ] </m> , the free dg-commutative ring generated by <m> | x | = 0 </m> and <m> | \eta | = 1 </m> . here , there is a presentation of <m> \mathcal { O } ( G / G ) </m> as a cocyclic set -LRB- as discussed in jantzen 's book -RRB- and the `` dual '' connes degree <m> - 1 </m> operator <m> B ^ * </m> -LRB- i do n't know if this is written down anywhere -RRB- sends <m> \eta \mapsto x </m> . however , i do n't understand why this cocyclic set should have anything to do with the circle action on loops . in particular , it seems somewhat orthogonal to the first example : there , the cyclic structure came from taking a left-derived functor , and here the cocyclic arises from taking a right-derived functor . question : how does this -LRB- co -RRB- cyclic structure arise from first dag principles ? example 3 : <m> Y / G </m> the loop space of <m> Y / G </m> is again a derived scheme stacky-modulo a group action of <m> G </m> . we can identify this scheme by the derived fiber product <m> Y / G \times _ { B G } \text { S p e c } ( k ) = Y \times _ { Y \times Y } ( G \times Y ) </m> . if <m> Y </m> is affine , we can take a bar resolution of <m> Y </m> over <m> Y \times Y </m> . however , the resulting complex after tensoring with the right factor is not a cyclic set in any obvious way to me . for example , taking <m> Y = \mathbb { A } ^ 1 </m> and <m> G = \mathbb { G } _ m </m> , the first differential in the resulting complex is a map <m> k [ x ] \otimes k [ x ] \otimes k [ z ^ { \pm 1 } ] \rightarrow k [ x ] \otimes k [ z ^ { \pm 1 } ] </m> , sending -LRB- assume <m> f , g </m> homogeneous -RRB- <m> f \otimes g \otimes 1 \mapsto f g \otimes ( 1 - z ^ { | g | } ) </m> which does not intertwine with any rotation homomorphism i can think to define -LRB- even `` twisted '' ones -RRB- . question : what is the <m> S ^ 1 </m> action on this -LRB- sort of -RRB- derived loop space ?

let <m> \overline { \mathscr { M } } _ g </m> be the <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - algebraic stack of stable curves of genus <m> g \ge 2 </m> , as constructed in the paper of deligne and mumford . the degeneracy locus of the universal stable curve is a closed substack <m> D \subset \overline { \mathscr { M } } _ g </m> that is a relative effective cartier divisor over <m> \mathrm { S p e c } ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> , so <m> D </m> gives rise to a line bundle <m> \mathcal { L } </m> on <m> \overline { \mathscr { M } } _ g </m> . is there a relation between <m> \mathcal { L } </m> and the line bundle <m> \lambda </m> defined as the determinant bundle of the pushforward of the relative dualizing sheaf of the universal stable curve ? specifically , is <m> \mathcal { L } \simeq \lambda ^ { \otimes m } </m> for some <m> m </m> , and , if so , for which <m> m </m> ?
how can i calculate the rank of curves <m> y ^ 2 = x ^ 3 \pm i </m> over q -LRB- i -RRB- ? is there any soft function to do it ?

i just asked today the following question : on groups with finite pro- <m> p </m> completion for all primes <m> p </m> . however , i can actually simplified what i am interested in , but as it is somewhat a more general question i will leave both of them . it is a famous open question whether every finitely generated group without polynomial growth has word growth <m> \succeq e ^ { \sqrt { n } } </m> . so my question is :
generally there is no euler product for dirichlet l-functions <m> L ( \chi , s ) </m> in the critical strip . -LRB- cf is the euler product formula always divergent for 0 < re -LRB- s -RRB- < 1 ? -RRB- but i would like to know if there is an euler product for the following product -LRB- with <m> \chi </m> a primitive characater -RRB- : <m> L ( \chi , s ) L ( \overline { \chi } , 1 - s ) = \sum \limits _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \sum \limits _ { k = 1 } ^ { \infty } \chi ( n ) \frac { 1 } { n ^ { 1 - s } } \; \overline { \chi ( k ) } \frac { 1 } { k ^ { s } } </m> in the specific case where <m> s = \frac { 1 } { 2 } + i t </m> as in this case -LRB- product is on prime numbers -RRB- : <m> S _ P ( \chi ) = \prod \limits _ { p = 1 } ^ { P } ( 1 - \chi ( p ) p ^ { - s } ) ^ { - 1 } ( 1 - \overline { \chi ( p ) } p ^ { s - 1 } ) ^ { - 1 } = \prod \limits _ { p = 1 } ^ { P } ( 1 - ( \chi ( p ) p ^ { - \frac { 1 } { 2 } - i t } + \overline { \chi ( p ) } p ^ { - \frac { 1 } { 2 } + i t } ) + p ^ { - 1 } ) ^ { - 1 } </m> so the term <m> ( \chi ( p ) p ^ { - \frac { 1 } { 2 } - i t } + \overline { \chi ( p ) } p ^ { - \frac { 1 } { 2 } + i t } ) </m> is real and if i take the log of the product it seems i have a sum with divergent terms going to <m> - \infty </m> meaning the product converges . <m> l n ( S _ P ( \chi ) ) = - \sum \limits _ { p = 1 } ^ { P } - ( \chi ( p ) p ^ { - \frac { 1 } { 2 } - i t } + \overline { \chi ( p ) } p ^ { - \frac { 1 } { 2 } + i t } ) - \sum \limits _ { p = 1 } ^ { P } p ^ { - 1 } + . . . </m> so , is this correct and in this specific case an euler product exits ?
the question of knowing whether there are infinitely many fibonacci primes is an open question . as <m> F _ p </m> is prime only if <m> p </m> is prime , one has <m> \pi _ { F P } ( x ) \le \pi ( \log _ { \phi } x + 0 . 5 \log 5 ) </m> , but numerical computations seem to show that this quantity is roughly equal to <m> \log _ { \phi } \log _ { \phi } x </m> , where <m> \pi _ { F P } ( x ) </m> is the number of fibonacci primes below <m> x </m> . is there any heuristics suggesting this estimation should be true ? thanks in advance .

i have asked this on math stack exchange but without answers : the usual ring operations on <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> can be defined via polynomials in <m> \mathbb { Z } [ a , b ] </m> -LRB- when viewing <m> a , b </m> as variables -RRB- : addition : <m> ( a , b ) \mapsto a + b \in \mathbb { Z } [ a , b ] </m> multiplication : <m> ( a , b ) \mapsto a \cdot b \in \mathbb { Z } [ a , b ] </m> there are more ring structures on <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> that can be described with polynomials , e.g. <m> ( \mathbb { Z } , P _ A , P _ M ) </m> with <m> P _ A ( a , b ) = a + b - 1 </m> and <m> P _ M ( a , b ) = a + b - a b </m> . here the neutral element w.r.t. <m> P _ A </m> is <m> 1 </m> and those w.r.t. <m> P _ M </m> is <m> 0 </m> . when we do n't require the ring to have a neutral element w.r.t. multiplication , we could even take <m> P _ A ( a , b ) = a + b </m> and <m> P _ M ( a , b ) = 0 </m> . my question is : can one characterize the pairs <m> ( P _ A , P _ M ) </m> of polynomials , such that <m> ( \mathbb { Z } , P _ A , P _ M ) </m> is a ring ? how does this change when we
i apologize if the question is bit trivial for mathoverflow , but i asked on stack exchange a while ago and have n't got any answer . let <m> k </m> be a field of characteristic <m> p > 0 </m> . consider the multiplicative group scheme <m> \mathbb { G } _ m </m> and its subgroup <m> \mu _ p </m> , the <m> p </m> - th roots of unity . it is well known that the quotient presheaf <m> \mathbb { G } _ m / \mu _ p </m> is not a sheaf in fppf topology , and its sheafification in fppf topology is representable by <m> \mathbb { G } _ m </m> via the morphism <m> \mathbb { G } _ m \xrightarrow { \cdot \mapsto \cdot ^ p } \mathbb { G } _ m </m> . however , is the quotient presheaf <m> \mathbb { G } _ m / \mu _ p </m> an étale sheaf on the category of <m> k </m> - schemes ? if <m> U \rightarrow X </m> is an étale cover , i can prove the equalizer sequence <m> \mathbb { G } _ m / \mu _ p ( X ) \rightarrow \mathbb { G } _ m / \mu _ p ( U ) \rightarrow \mathbb { G } _ m / \mu _ p ( U \times _ X U ) </m> is exact when x is reduced . in fact , if <m> s \in \mathcal { O } _ X ( U ) ^ \times </m> and <m> ( \frac { s \otimes 1 } { 1 \otimes s } ) ^ p = 1 </m> , since <m> U \times _ X U </m> is again reduced we can deduce <m> s \otimes 1 = 1 \otimes s </m> hence <m> s \in \mathcal { O } _ X ( X ) ^ \times </m> . however i do n't know to prove the general case when <m> X </m> is not reduced . i tried several ways to formulate an induction , but could n't work it out . appreciate any hints towards a proof or a counterproof . thank you !
edit : some additional details and corrections , i would appreciate any information about the highlighted expression . i try to solve <m> \int _ 0 ^ T e ^ { - x } \frac { I _ n ( \alpha x ) } { x } d x </m> where <m> I _ n ( x ) </m> is the modified bessel function of the first kind and <m> 0 < \alpha < 1 </m> . my first approach was to turn this integral into an infinite sum to fit a hypergeometric series :
it 's well know that the first order dehn function of <m> F </m> is quadratic . is a similar result known for its second-order , or even higher-order , dehn function ? the second-order dehn function of a group <m> G = G ( \mathcal { P } ) </m> is defined as follows . for a generating set <m> X </m> of the second-homotopy module <m> \pi _ 2 ( \mathcal { P } ) </m> the volume of <m> \xi \in \pi _ 2 ( \mathcal { P } ) </m> is defined to be the minimum number of elements of <m> X </m> required to generate <m> \xi </m> . the second-order dehn function is then given by <m> \delta ( n ) = \mbox { m a x } \{ v o l u m e ( \xi ) : a r e a ( \xi ) \leq n \} . </m> this is a natural extension of the notion `` max area over min length '' as in the first-order case .
various questions on mo concerning the `` surprise '' occurrence of the gamma function in the functional equation of the riemann zeta function got me wondering whether the gamma function alone suffice for an analytic formulation of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic . pondering this lead me to consider the product <m> ( x + 1 ) \prod _ n \Gamma \left ( 1 + \frac { x } { n } \right ) ^ { \mu ( n ) } </m> whose convergence is apparently equivalent to the prime number theorem . -LRB- fix <m> x \not = 0 , - 1 </m> , apply <m> \ln </m> and linearize to get a series that eventually behaves like <m> 1 - 1 / 2 - 1 / 3 - 1 / 5 + 1 / 6 - 1 / 7 + \cdots </m> . -RRB- the limit appears to equal <m> e ^ x </m> . of course my motivation lay in using mobius-type inclusion-exclusion to eliminate one by one all the poles . my question : does this expression occur in the literature ?

this is related to a question asked on mathstackexchange https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/831184/for-every-null-set-e-there-is-a-measurable-set-f-with-different-upper-and-lo . this question is inspired by remark 7.4 from the paper <m> \textit { S t r u c t u r e o f N u l l S e t s i n t h e P l a n e a n d A p p l i c a t i o n s } </m> . the remark in the paper states that given a set <m> E \subset \mathbb { R } </m> of measure zero one can find a set <m> F \subset \mathbb { R } </m> of positive measure so that all the points of <m> E </m> have lower lebesgue density 0 and upper lebesgue density 1 . in the mathstackexchange post , the answer uses the uncentred balls definition for upper and lower lebesgue density -LRB- i.e. the lower lebesgue density is defined as <m> \liminf _ { x \in B , m ( B ) \rightarrow 0 } \frac { m ( F \cap B ) } { m ( B ) } </m> and the upper lebesgue density is defined in the same way with <m> \limsup </m> instead of <m> \liminf </m> -RRB- . my question is , is it possible to find a set <m> F </m> using the centred balls definition of lebesgue density ? that is , given a set of <m> E </m> of measure 0 can we find a set <m> F </m> of positive measure so that <m> \liminf _ { r \rightarrow 0 } \frac { m ( F \cap B _ r ( x ) ) } { m ( B _ r ( x ) ) } = 0 </m> and <m> \limsup _ { r \rightarrow 0 } \frac { m ( F \cap B _ r ( x ) ) } { m ( B _ r ( x ) ) } = 1 </m> for all <m> x \in E </m> ?

if we assume ma + ¬ ch , then every boolean algebra with cardinality smaller than the continuum embeds in ℘ -LRB- ω -RRB- / fin . a proof of this result can be found in theorem 1.1 , chapter 8 of the book `` hausdorff gaps and limits '' . in the paper `` r. frankiewicz , some remarks on embeddings of boolean algebras and topological spaces ii , fund . math , 126 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , 1985 , 63-68 . '' , the author showed that it is consistent with ma + ¬ ch the existence of a boolean algebra with cardinality equal to the continuum which does not embed in ℘ -LRB- ω -RRB- / fin . is it consistent with <m> M A + \neg C H </m> that every boolean algebra with cardinaly equal to the continuum embeds in ℘ -LRB- ω -RRB- / fin ?

in the algebra of matrices <m> M _ n ( A ) </m> over a <m> C ^ * </m> algebra <m> A </m> , consider the corner algebra <m> P M _ n ( A ) P </m> for a hermitian projection <m> P \in M _ n ( A ) </m> . is there any condition known for <m> P </m> to make <m> P M _ n ( A ) P </m> isomorphic to <m> A </m> ? if not , where should i look for what is known on the structure of <m> P M _ n ( A ) P </m> ? -LRB- this question is aimed at linking the peoperties of <m> P </m> to <m> P M _ n ( A ) P </m> in general , rather than for the case of specific <m> C ^ * </m> algebras . -RRB- the background : a morita context from <m> A </m> to itself can be viewed as a left finitely generated projective <m> A </m> - module <m> L </m> whose left module maps are themselves isomorphic to <m> A </m> - thus giving a bimodule structure . if <m> L </m> has associated projection matrix <m> P </m> in <m> K </m> - theory , then the left module maps are given by the corner algebra <m> P M _ n ( A ) P </m> , thus the question of when this is isomorphic to <m> A </m> . -LRB- this is the noncommutative analogue of a line bundle in geometry . -RRB-

inspired by a related question with respect to squarefree integers , i am asking how sharp one can obtain a result of the following type : let <m> k \geq 2 </m> be a fixed positive integer . for which functions <m> f : \mathbb { Z } \rightarrow \mathbb { R } </m> can we conclude that intervals of the type <m> \left [ n , n + \frac { f ( n ) \log n } { \log \log n } \right ] </m> contain no number that is <m> k </m> - free ? that is , every number in the interval is divisible by <m> p ^ k </m> for some prime <m> p </m> . in this question -LRB- consecutive non squarefree integers -RRB- , the case <m> k = 2 </m> is considered and that <m> f </m> can be taken to be a constant . are there any non-trivial improvements -LRB- that is , not just an improvement on the constant <m> c </m> -RRB- for the case <m> k > 2 </m> ?

i was wondering if there was a really good place to learn about this topic that actually contains the details of the construction from beginning to end . i 'm familiar with the book by harris and morrison , and many of the papers about the construction . the recent book by arbarello , cornalba , and griffiths covers the complex case in a very nice and detailed way , but i was wondering if there was a good place to learn this 1 -RRB- that only uses algebraic geometry and not complex analytic geometry , and 2 -RRB- that covers the construction over <m> \mathbb Z </m> so one can use it in the arithmetic case . most books simply leave so many details out that a beginner in the subject finds it hard to fill them all in and truly understand the construction . any good references would be much appreciated . thanks

let <m> \mathcal { A } = \{ V : \mathbb { U } _ n \rightarrow \mathbb { C } \} </m> where <m> \mathbb { U } _ n </m> is the group of the complex <m> n </m> - th roots of the unity . this group naturally acts on <m> \mathcal { A } </m> : for any <m> a \in \mathbb { U } _ n </m> , and any <m> V \in \mathcal { A } </m> <m>  </m> -LRB- a \ star v -RRB- : b \ mapsto v -LRB- a ^ -LCB- -1 -RCB- b -RRB- <m>  </m> i define <m> F i x ( V ) = \{ a \in \mathbb { U } _ n , ~ a \star V = V \} </m> the symmetry group of <m> V </m> . my question is : can we define an equivariant function <m> \lambda : \mathcal { A } \rightarrow \mathbb { C } </m> which measures the `` asymmetry '' of <m> V </m> , i.e. , a function such that for all <m> a , V </m> <m>  </m> \ lambda -LRB- a \ star v -RRB- & = a \ lambda -LRB- v -RRB- \ \ \ lambda -LRB- v -RRB- = 0 & \ leftrightarrow fix -LRB- v -RRB- \ neq \ -LCB- 1 \ -RCB- <m>  </m> is it related to some known problem ? satisfying the first condition is ok , for instance <m>  </m> \ lambda _ 0 -LRB- v -RRB- = \ sum _ -LCB- z \ in \ mathbb -LCB- u -RCB- _ n -RCB- z v -LRB- z -RRB- <m>  </m> but the second condition is not ok . indeed , it suffices to take <m> V </m> as the indicator function of , say , the union of a triangle and a square -LRB- in a suitable <m> \mathbb { U } _ n </m> -RRB- . the sum above is zero but this <m> V </m> has a trivial symmetry group . thank you .
let <m> ( \alpha _ k ) </m> be a sequence of positive numbers and let <m> ( Y _ k ) </m> be a sequence of independent random variables <m> Y _ k \sim \text { G a m m a } ( \alpha _ k , 1 ) </m> . set <m> X _ n = \dfrac { Y _ n } { \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n Y _ i } </m> . -LRB- edit -RRB- the title is not appropriate : <m> ( X _ 1 , . . . , X _ n ) </m> is not a dirichlet vector , because <m> X _ k = \dfrac { Y _ k } { \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ k Y _ i } \neq \dfrac { Y _ k } { \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n Y _ i } </m> . sorry for the confusion .
in loeb measure , a set is loeb measurable iff it is <m> \mu </m> - approximable , where <m> \mu </m> -LRB- roughly speaking -RRB- is a finitely additive hypervalued measure over internal sets . but i found the definitions of <m> \mu </m> - approximablity differ in different places . one is that a set <m> C </m> is <m> \mu </m> - approximable if for every hyperreal <m> \epsilon </m> , there are internal sets <m> A , B </m> such that <m> A \subseteq C \subseteq B </m> and <m> \mu ( B - A ) < \epsilon </m> . another is roughly the same but instead of every hyperreal <m> \epsilon </m> , it says `` for every real <m> \epsilon </m> . '' thanks a lot ! i am not a math major or anything close , so it 's my only place to ask ! references :
a graph is a minimal graph of diameter <m> 2 </m> if it has diameter <m> 2 </m> and the deletion of any edge increases its diameter . let <m> G </m> be a minimal graph of diameter <m> 2 </m> , then every edge of <m> G </m> belongs to a path <m> u </m> - <m> v </m> in <m> G </m> which is the unique path of length at most <m> 2 </m> with endpoints <m> u </m> and <m> v </m> . my question is : if <m> H </m> is a graph satisfies every edge of <m> H </m> belongs to a path <m> u </m> - <m> v </m> in <m> H </m> which is the unique path of length at most <m> 2 </m> with endpoints <m> u </m> and <m> v </m> . does there must exist a minimal graph <m> G </m> of diameter <m> 2 </m> such that <m> V ( G ) = V ( H ) </m> and <m> H </m> is a subgraph of <m> G </m> ?
for an open complete riemannian manifold <m> M </m> with non-negative sectional curvature , the busemann function defined below is a convex exhaustion function -LRB- by cheeger-gromoll 's proof of soul theorem -RRB- the buesemann function : <m> b ( x ) = \sup _ { \gamma } b _ { \gamma } ( x ) </m> where the <m> s u p </m> is taken over all rays from a given point and <m> b _ { \gamma } </m> is the busemann function associated with ray <m> \gamma </m> : <m> b _ { \gamma } ( x ) = \lim _ { t \to \infty } ( t - d ( x , \gamma ( t ) ) </m> a function <m> f : M \to \mathbb [ a , \infty ) </m> is called an exhaustion function on <m> M </m> if its sublevel set <m> \Omega _ c : = f ^ { - 1 } ( ( - \infty , c ] ) </m> is compact for all <m> c </m> and <m> M = \cup _ c \Omega _ c </m> . i am wondering that when we assume ricci curvature is non-negative , is there any example where the busemann function <m> b </m> is not an exhaustion ? -LRB- in this case the busemann function is subharmonic . -RRB-
there are a number of results which count the number of possible algebraic structures on a set of <m> n </m> elements . notable previous mo questions are for example here and here . the analogous question for finite categories does not seem to enjoy the same attention as other algebraic structures . the only source i could find was the following oeis entry . simply put the first question is as follows :
let <m> \lambda </m> be a partition with <m> \leq n </m> rows and let <m> L _ { \lambda } </m> be the corresponding irreducible representation of <m> { \rm G L } _ n ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> . let <m> e _ m ( X _ 1 , \dots , X _ n ) </m> be the <m> m </m> th elementary symmetric polynomial . is there a known formula for the element <m> c _ m \in Z ( U ( \mathfrak { g l } _ n ) ) </m> which acts on <m> L _ { \lambda } </m> by the scalar <m> e _ m ( \lambda _ 1 , \dots , \lambda _ n ) </m> ? it is easy to check that <m> c _ 1 = E _ { 1 1 } + \dots + E _ { n n } </m> , so i suspect that <m> c _ m </m> should be related to the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial . also , i am aware of the harish-chandra isomorphism , but have not been able to use it to produce a formula . i would be particularly interested in references where this is worked out . i could n't find it in any of the standard representation theory text books .
let <m> X </m> be a separable topological space of size <m> \mathfrak { c } </m> . by a simple function <m> \phi : X \to X </m> , we mean a finite range valued measurable function . q. is it possible to find a sequence of simple functions <m> \{ \phi _ n \} </m> with <m> \lim \phi _ n ( x ) = x </m> for every <m> x \in X </m> ?
consider a sequence of maps between <m> R </m> modules -LRB- where <m> R </m> is a ring with unity -RRB- <m> \cdots \rightarrow M _ { n + 1 } \xrightarrow { d _ { n + 1 } } M _ { n } \xrightarrow { d _ { n } } M _ { n - 1 } \rightarrow \cdots </m> such that <m> \ker ( d _ n ) \subseteq \text { i m } ( d _ { n + 1 } ) </m> for all <m> n </m> -LRB- so the sequence is not necessarily a complex , and , if it is , it is an exact sequence -RRB- . my question is this : does anyone know of any references where such objects have been studied ? the case i am interested in is where <m> M = \oplus _ { n \in \mathbb { Z } } M _ n </m> is a curved dg-module over some curved dg-algebra ; sequences of maps between modules that do not form complexes but which do have the above property come up naturally in this setting . this question is also posted on mse : https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/345173/sequences-of-maps-between-modules-such-that-kerd-n-subseteq-textimd-n
i posted the following question also here , but thought that i can get more answers in mo. . let <m> ( \Omega , \Sigma ) </m> be a measurable space and <m> \nu _ 1 </m> , <m> \nu _ 2 </m> two probability measures on it . for <m> i = 1 , 2 </m> , let <m> L _ { \nu _ i } : L ^ { 1 } ( \nu _ i ) \rightarrow \mathbb R </m> be the map defined by <m> L _ { \nu _ i } ( g ) = \int _ \Omega g d \nu _ i </m> . denote by <m> [ 1 _ E ] _ { \nu _ i } </m> the equivalence class in <m> L ^ 1 ( \nu _ i ) </m> of the characteristic function <m> 1 _ E </m> . does there always exist a linear map <m> M : L ^ 1 ( \nu _ 1 ) \rightarrow L ^ 1 ( \nu _ 2 ) </m> such that <m> L _ { \nu _ 2 } \circ M ( [ 1 _ E ] _ { \nu _ 1 } ) = L _ { \nu _ 1 } ( [ 1 _ E ] _ { \nu _ 1 } ) </m> for all <m> E \in \Sigma </m> ? when <m> \nu _ 1 </m> is absolutely continuous to <m> \nu _ 2 </m> then , by the radon-nykodim theorem , the map <m> M </m> can be given explicitly , i.e. there exists a <m> \Sigma </m> - measurable function <m> f : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb R </m> , such that <m> M ( g ) : = f \cdot g </m> will satisfy the equation given above . so the question becomes interesting when <m> \nu _ 1 </m> and <m> \nu _ 2 </m> are singular to each other , and the spaces <m> L ^ 1 ( \nu _ 1 ) </m> and <m> L ^ 1 ( \nu _ 2 ) </m> are not isometric . the way i think of it is , that it could characterize in some/all cases a radon-nykodim derivative when the measures are singular to each other ... comments on this are welcome !
let <m> Y </m> be an orientable , smooth 3-manifold and let <m> X = Y \times S ^ { 1 } </m> . my question is that : when does <m> X </m> admits a riemannian metric with positive scalar curvature ? an obvious case is when <m> Y </m> itself admits a psc metric . are there any other case ? it was proved by gromov and lawson that any 3-manifold which contains a <m> K ( \pi , 1 ) </m> prime factor does not admits a psc metric -LRB- another result in the paper implies that <m> Y </m> should not be hyperbolic if <m> Y \times S ^ { 1 } </m> admits psc -RRB- , which , together with the geometrization conjecture classifies all the 3-manifold admits psc metric . does their proof works for <m> Y \times S ^ { 1 } </m> ? -LRB- i am most interested in the special case that <m> Y </m> is an irreducible integer homology sphere -RRB-
for consecutive primes <m> a \lt b \lt c </m> , prove that <m> a + b \ge c </m> . i can not find a counter-example to this . do we know if this inequality is true ? alternatively , is this some documented problem -LRB- solved or unsolved -RRB- ?
let us first remark that all of this takes place on the boundary of <m> \Delta ^ n </m> . the question that i wanted to solve that led to the question in the title is as follows : let <m> f : \Delta ^ { n - 1 } \hookrightarrow \Delta ^ n </m> be an injective map . what i would have liked to do is to extend that map to a map , <m> \tilde { f } : \partial \Delta ^ n \hookrightarrow \Delta ^ n </m> such that the restriction of <m> \tilde { f } </m> on any the n-1 simplices of the boundary is the original map <m> f </m> up to an action of the symmetric group on n letters . one can see with a little thought that the condition needed to be able to obtain this is as follows : first we construct the graph mentioned in the question . to recapitulate , the vertices of this graph are the set of n-2 simplicies . we then attach an edge between two vertices if the two n-2 simplices are contained in the same n-1 simplex . let us call this graph <m> X _ n </m> for lack of better notation . one may extend build the <m> \tilde { f } </m> if -LRB- and only if i believe -RRB- if the graph constructed is <m> n </m> colorable . now by working it out by hand , i showed that this is impossible for <m> n = 2 </m> , possible for <m> n = 3 </m> impossible for <m> n = 4 </m> and i believe that it is impossible for dimensions above . what is a proof for this fact ? i did the work by hand for the cases i mentioned . it would be even better to know the actual chromatic number for these graph .
let <m> E / F </m> be a quadratic field extension of p-adic fields . let <m> V </m> be a -LRB- skew - -RRB- hermitian space and <m> U ( V ) </m> be the unitary group . let <m> G U ( V ) </m> be the similitude unitary group . given an irreducible smooth representation <m> \pi </m> of <m> G U ( V ) </m> , do we know that the restriction <m> \pi | _ { U ( V ) } </m> has multiplicity one ? for the pair <m> ( G L ( n ) , S L ( n ) ) </m> similar results are proved by tadic . for the pair <m> ( G S p , S p ) </m> , similar results are proved by adler-prasad . i am wondering if the unitary group version is true or not . thanks .

a simplicial set is called finite if it has only a finite number of non degenerate simplicies -LRB- or equivalently , if its number of <m> n </m> - simplicies grows polynomially with <m> n </m> -RRB- . in an answer to a previous question of mine exponentiation in finite simplicial sets it was shown that for any <m> n \geq 4 </m> the simplicial set <m> ( \Delta _ n / \partial \Delta _ n ) ^ { \Delta _ 1 } </m> is not finite . following one of the comments there , i wanted to ask :
for <m> A , B \subseteq \omega </m> we write <m> A \subseteq ^ * B </m> if <m> A \setminus B </m> is finite . we call <m> { \cal T } \subseteq { \cal P } ( \omega ) </m> a tower if it is linearly quasiordered with respect to <m> \subseteq ^ * </m> . using zorn 's lemma , it is easy to see that every tower is contained in a maximal tower . does every maximal tower have the same cardinality ? and if not , is there a cardinal <m> \kappa \leq 2 ^ { \aleph _ 0 } </m> such that
maybe this is just a very fundamental problem , but i am not too sure the answer . it is well-known that <m> S L ( 2 , 5 ) </m> is contained in <m> S L ( 2 , q ) </m> iff <m> q </m> is odd and <m> 5 \mid q ( q ^ 2 - 1 ) </m> . my question is whether we can always say <m> S L ( 2 , 5 ) </m> is irreducible on the vector space <m> G F ( q ) ^ 2 </m> ?
what are some of the most symmetric configurations of four 2-surfaces linked in the 4-dimensional sphere <m> S ^ 4 </m> ?
in the study of singular spaces , topological methods like intersection cohomology have played an important role . they have led to the development of technology like perverse sheaves and these find widespread application in , for instance , representation theory . there are , however , another approach to singular spaces that is analytical in nature -LRB- uses the riemannian metrics defined on these spaces obtained with the singularity removed -RRB- and is called <m> L ^ 2 </m> cohomology since it involves the study of differential forms that are <m> L ^ 2 </m> complete and their associated chain complexes , cohomology etc. now , there are standard conjectures of cheeger-goresky-macpherson -LRB- back to 80s , i think -RRB- , that relate the two theories . i would like to know the current status of these conjectures . in particular , are there some special cases for which it is already proven ? my interest is specifically in the case of the singular spaces that arise in representation theory . for a plethora of examples that satisfy this description , lusztig 's icm -LRB- found here -RRB- is a good place -LRB- ex include schubert varieties , nilpotent orbits etc. -RRB-
let <m> \binom x y </m> be the binomial coefficient . i am trying to get a better understanding of the sum <m> f ( N , \lambda ) = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { N - 1 } \binom { N - 1 } n \frac { ( - 1 ) ^ n } { n + 1 } e ^ { - \frac { n } { 2 ( n + 1 ) } \lambda } </m> as a function of <m> \lambda </m> and <m> N </m> without having to plot it for all possible values . do you know of a way to simplify it or approximate it ? although i 'd rather obtain an approximation for positive <m> \lambda </m> and <m> N </m> , an asymptotic approximation for <m> \lambda \rightarrow \infty </m> or <m> N \rightarrow \infty </m> , or even an upper-bound would be helpful too . here is an equivalent expression : <m> f ( N , \lambda ) = \frac { 1 } { N } \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { N } \binom N n ( - 1 ) ^ { n - 1 } e ^ { - \frac { n - 1 } { 2 n } \lambda } . </m> in my opinion , this sum could be easily simplified if the exponential term would have an argument that was not a rational function <m> \frac { n } { n + 1 } </m> or <m> \frac { n - 1 } { n } </m> . i have not found a way in the literature to deal with it .
let <m> S </m> be a sub-ring of a commuttaive ring with unity <m> R </m> . then <m> S </m> is called factorially closed in <m> R </m> if <m> a , b \in R </m> and <m> a b \in S \implies a , b \in S </m> . my question is : let <m> k </m> be an algebraically closed field of characteristic <m> 0 </m> . let <m> A </m> be an integral domain which is a finitely generated <m> k </m> - algebra such that <m> A </m> is a factorially closed subring of <m> k [ X _ 1 , . . . , X _ n ] </m> , and <m> t r d e g _ k ( A ) = n - 1 </m> , where <m> n \ge 4 </m> . when/under what additional assumptions on <m> k </m> or <m> A </m> , can we say that <m> A </m> is a polynomial ring in <m> n - 1 </m> many variables over <m> k </m> ? even any reference in the direction of the question will also be appreciated . the case <m> n \le 3 </m> is settled in theorem 1 -LSB- factorially closed subrings of commutative rings , pp. 1140 -RSB-
i will write <m> \operatorname { D i f f } </m> to denote a category of generalized smooth spaces e.g. <m> S h ( \mathsf { C a r t S p } ) </m> . is there a version of <m> \operatorname { D i f f } </m> for which there exists a functor <m> \mathcal { S ^ { \infty } } : \mathbb { R - } S c h \to \operatorname { D i f f } </m> which could legitimately be called the smoothing functor ? i 'm not nearly experienced enough in any of the relevant fields to conjecture what such a functor must satisfy so i 'm deliberately leaving the vaguenesss in the above question . however , for the sake of completeness i will state some properties i think are relavant here :
suppose <m> X </m> is a zero-dimensional completely regular space -LRB- clopen sets form a base -RRB- such that the boolean algebra of clopen sets is a <m> \sigma </m> - complete boolean algebra . must <m> X </m> be basically disconnected ? that is , must every cozero set in <m> X </m> have open closure ? i thought this was known , but i ca n't find it . the point is to show that such <m> X </m> is strongly zero-dimensional , i.e. , <m> \beta ( X ) </m> is zero-dimensional , so that every cozero set is a countable union of clopens . it should be noted that the analogous statement for extremally disconnected spaces is true : a zero-dimensional space is extremally disconnected -LRB- open sets have open closures -RRB- if and only if the boolean algebra of all its clopen sets is a complete boolean algebra . the proof is an easy exercise .
for any lattice <m> L </m> we denote the complete lattice of the ideals of <m> L </m> by <m> { \cal I d } ( L ) </m> . are there non-isomorphic lattices <m> L \not \cong K </m> such that <m> { \cal I d } ( L ) \cong { \cal I d } ( K ) </m> ?
for example given a great circle within the sphere , we can think about computing the average distance of a point on the sphere from the great circle . slightly more generally , given a subgroup <m> H \subset </m> su -LRB- n -RRB- and a point <m> p \in \mathbb { C P } ^ { n - 1 } </m> one can think about the subspace <m> H p </m> consisting of the images <m> h p </m> where <m> h \in H </m> . then we can ask how closely <m> H p </m> approximates <m> \mathbb { C P } ^ { n - 1 } </m> under the fubini-study metric . i am interested both in the farthest a point in <m> q \in \mathbb { C P } ^ { n - 1 } </m> could be from <m> H p </m> and in the average distance from a point in <m> \mathbb { C P } ^ { n - 1 } </m> to <m> H p </m> . this problem is highly relevant for understanding the capacity of near-term quantum computers . in this context , we can understand the subgroup <m> H </m> as the restricted set of gate operations we are permitted to apply and <m> p \in \mathbb { C P } ^ { n - 1 } </m> as the initial quantum state to which we apply gates , so that the approximation question corresponds to how accurately we can reach any state given limited resources . in particular , this corresponds to finding a worse-case bound on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm . addendum in particular i am interested in subgroups of su -LRB- <m> 2 ^ n </m> -RRB- . the pauli matrices <m> i \sigma _ 1 , i \sigma _ 2 , i \sigma _ 3 </m> form a basis for <m> \mathfrak { s u } ( 2 ) </m> -LRB- note that this matches the fact that dim -LRB- su -LRB- n -RRB- -RRB- = <m> n ^ 2 - 1 </m> -RRB- . similarly the n-fold tensor products of pauli matrices and the identity -LRB- e.g <m> i \sigma _ 1 \otimes \sigma _ 3 \otimes \sigma _ 2 \otimes I \otimes \cdots </m> -RRB- form a basis for <m> \mathfrak { s u } ( 2 ^ n ) </m> . i can restrict to a subset <m> B </m> of this basis , then add the other necessary basis elements to m ake a set closed under the bracket <m> C </m> . then the lie algebra generated by the basis <m> C </m> is <m> \mathfrak { g } \subset \mathfrak { s u } ( 2 ^ n ) </m> . now the lie subgroup of su -LRB- <m> 2 ^ n ) </m> i care about is <m> G = e ^ { \mathfrak { g } } </m> . in the interest of being concrete as possible i will pick a low-dimensional example . lets focus on su -LRB- <m> 2 ^ 2 </m> -RRB- acting on <m> \mathbb { C P } ^ { 2 ^ 2 - 1 } </m> - this corresponds to a system with 2 qubits . i decide to examine the lie algebra generated by the set <m> \{ I X + X I , Z Z \} </m> . this generates a five-dimensional subgroup qaoa -LRB- <m> 2 ^ 2 </m> -RRB- of <m> S U ( 2 ^ 2 ) </m> . since <m> d i m ( \mathbb { C P } ^ { 3 } ) = 6 </m> , i know that the subspace qaoa -LRB- <m> 2 ^ 2 </m> -RRB- p is a proper subset of <m> \mathbb { C P } ^ { 3 } </m> . i then want to know how well qaoa -LRB- <m> 2 ^ 2 </m> -RRB- p approximates <m> \mathbb { C P } ^ { 3 } </m> . this method of limiting your basis set corresponds to restricting the allowed quantum gates which you will apply on your device . in particular i want to restrict my gate set as much as possible while maximizing my ability to approximate arbitrary states . in the long-term this line of inquiry aims to provide approximation ratios for quantum optimization algorithms

if <m> f ( x ) = a _ k ( n ) n ^ k + \dots + a _ 1 ( n ) n + a _ 0 ( n ) </m> is a quasi-polynomial -LRB- i.e. with <m> a _ 0 , \dots , a _ k </m> being periodic functions -RRB- from <m> \mathbb N </m> to <m> \mathbb N </m> , does it follow that all the coefficient functions <m> a _ i </m> of <m> f </m> just take rational values ?
take generators <m> a _ { i j } </m> for <m> 1 \le i , j \le n </m> . impose relations which come from the matrix <m> P = \left ( \begin {array} { c c c } a _ { 1 1 } & \dots & a _ { 1 n } \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a _ { n 1 } & \dots & a _ { n n } \end {array} \right ) </m> being a hermitian projection , i.e. <m> a _ { i j } ^ * = a _ { j i } </m> and <m> \sum _ j a _ { i j } \, a _ { j k } = a _ { i k } </m> . is there a unital universal <m> C ^ * </m> algebra with these generators and relations ? if not , what can be said ? why is this algebra interesting ? the answer is that it might -LRB- in some sense -RRB- classify finitely generated projective modules over a local <m> C ^ * </m> algebra <m> A </m> . such modules give projections in <m> M _ n ( A ) </m> , and an argument from blackadar 's book shows that these can be made hermitian . but such a hermitian projection is just a map from the algebra with generators and relations defined above to <m> A </m> .

in an analysis of the jacobi method for the computation of the spectrum of a hermitian matrix , i face the following problem . denote <m> { \cal P } _ 2 ( n ) </m> the set of doubletons <m> \{ a , b \} </m> in <m> [ [ 1 , 2 n ] ] = \{ 1 , \ldots , 2 n \} </m> . there are <m> n ( 2 n - 1 ) </m> of them . i wish to partition <m> { \cal P } _ 2 ( n ) </m> in equal parts <m> X _ 1 , \ldots , X _ { 2 n - 1 } </m> of cardinals <m> n </m> , such that the union of the elements of any <m> X _ \alpha </m> is precisely <m> [ [ 1 , 2 n ] ] </m> -LRB- <m> X _ \alpha </m> is a partition of <m> [ [ 1 , 2 n ] ] </m> -RRB- ? this can be viewed as a special partition of the complete graph over <m> 2 n </m> vertices . for <m> n = 2 </m> , there is only one solution . for <m> n = 3 </m> , there is a unique solution , up to a permutation in <m> [ [ 1 , 6 ] ] </m> . is there always a solution ? is there a natural -LRB- group theoretic ? -RRB- way to build one ? more generally , if <m> { \cal P } _ m ( m n ) </m> denotes the set of parts of <m> [ [ 1 , m n ] ] </m> of cardinal <m> m </m> , can it be partitionned in equal parts <m> X _ 1 , \ldots , X _ N </m> such that each <m> X _ \alpha </m> is a partition of <m> [ [ 1 , m n ] ] </m> .

i asked this question on stackexchange -LRB- https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1964415/maximal-k-split-torus-and-the-weyl-group-why-is-this-a-root-system -RRB- , but did not get an answer . <m> G </m> is a semisimple algebraic group defined over a field <m> F </m> , maximally split maximal torus <m> T </m> defined over <m> F </m> and maximal <m> F </m> - split subtorus <m> A _ 0 \subseteq T </m> . <m> R </m> is the set of roots of <m> T </m> in <m> G </m> , <m> X </m> is the group of characters of <m> T </m> , and <m> X _ 0 = A _ 0 ^ { \perp } </m> . the notes i 'm reading claim that <m> R _ 0 : = R \cap X _ 0 </m> is such that <m> ( \mathbb { Q } \otimes _ { \mathbb { Z } } X _ 0 , R _ 0 ) </m> is a root system . moreover , it is claimed that the <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> - span of <m> R _ 0 </m> , intersected with <m> X </m> , is equal to <m> X _ 0 </m> . i have n't been able to verify these claims . in fact , i believe that <m> R _ 0 </m> may even be the empty set even when <m> X _ 0 \neq 0 </m> . here is the example i used : example : <m> F = \mathbb { R } </m> , <m> G </m> is the derived group of <m> U ( 2 , 1 ) </m> , where <m> U ( 2 , 1 ) ( \mathbb { C } ) = \textrm { G L } _ 3 ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> , and <m> U ( 2 , 1 ) ( F ) = \{ x \in \textrm { G L } _ 3 : w \space ^ t \overline { x } ^ { - 1 } w = x \} </m> . here <m> w = \space ^ t \textrm { D i a g } ( 1 , - 1 , 1 ) </m> , and bar denotes element wise complex conjugation . then <m> T = \{ \begin {pmatrix} a & & \\ & b & \\ & & \frac { 1 } { a b } \end {pmatrix} \} </m> is a maximal torus of <m> G </m> , defined over <m> F </m> , and i believe <m> A _ 0 = \{ \begin {pmatrix} x & & \\ & 1 & \\ & & \frac { 1 } { x } \end {pmatrix} \} </m> is a maximally split <m> F </m> - split subtorus of <m> G </m> , contained in <m> T </m> . we can take <m> \chi _ 1 , \chi _ 2 </m> as a basis of <m> X </m> by restricting the standard characters on the usual maximal torus of <m> \textrm { G L } _ 3 </m> . then <m> X _ 0 = \{ n \chi _ 2 : n \in \mathbb { Z } \} </m> <m> R = \{ \pm ( \chi _ 1 - \chi _ 2 ) , \pm ( 2 \chi _ 1 + \chi _ 2 ) , \pm ( \chi _ 1 + 2 \chi _ 2 ) \} </m> and we see that <m> R \cap X _ 0 </m> is empty . <m> \blacksquare </m> is my example incorrect ? this fact about <m> ( X _ 0 , R _ 0 ) </m> being a root system is used in the notes i 'm reading to prove facts about a `` relative root system '' inside <m> X / X _ 0 </m> . but it seems to be like <m> ( X _ 0 , R _ 0 ) </m> need not be a root system .
search problem <m> M I N ^ P </m> is , given a polynomial-time computable predicate that is a partial order , to find its minimum -LRB- any will do -RRB- . search problem <m> M I N ^ L </m> is , given a polynomial-time computable predicate that is a linear order , to find its minimum . search problems can be interpreted as computational models -LRB- complexity classes -RRB- , namely as polynomial time bounded computations plus an oracle solving instances of the search problem . more formally , for example for linear orders : enhance a polynomial time bounded turing machine <m> S </m> with an oracle . the oracle input always consists of a number <m> n </m> and a code of another turing machine <m> T </m> . machine <m> T </m> -LRB- accepts pairs of integers and -RRB- computes an order relation <m> < ^ L </m> on integers from <m> 0 </m> to <m> n </m> and is constructed to guarantee termination in polynomial time . the oracle then outputs a minimum number <m> m </m> -LRB- that is , <m> 0 \le m \le n </m> , and <m> ( \forall x ) 0 \le x \le n \implies m < ^ L x \vee m = x </m> -RRB- . in case the machine <m> T </m> supplied to the oracle is invalid -LRB- not a turing machine code , or defining a relation which is not a linear order up to <m> n </m> -RRB- , the oracle is free to output any value . note that the size of <m> n </m> is by definition polynomial in the size of the input to the turing machine <m> S </m> , but its value may be exponential , and therefore the oracle may add computational power beyond polynomial time computable functions . my question is : can this computation model -LRB- call it , <m> M I N ^ L </m> -RRB- solve <m> M I N ^ P </m> ? to further clarify , here is a trivial proof of the converse . <m> S </m> will get some <m> n </m> and a code of a turing machine . it will simply feed both as <m> n </m> and <m> T </m> to its oracle , and output the oracle answer which is the desired minimum . this question is bugging me for some time . a negative answer would entail some quite interesting consequences for fragments of bounded arithmetic .

i 'm not sure if this question is too low level for math overflow -LRB- so feel free to move this to se if you think it is -RRB- . inspired by this and this question i 'm wondering if the following statement is also true for pseudo-riemannian manifolds : a pseudo-riemannian manifold <m> ( M , g ) </m> is complete if and only if its universal covering <m> ( \tilde { M } , \tilde { g } ) </m> is complete . the reason i ask is that in the above links the theorem of hopf rinow plays an important role in the proof of this statement and since this theorem is not available for pseudo-riemannian manifolds , i 'm wondering if the statement also holds for pseudo-riemannian manifolds . if this statement is not true , are there special instances where it holds nevertheless ?

suppose <m> R </m> is a noncommutative ring . what is the sufficient and necessary condition for <m> G L _ n ( R ) </m> embedding into <m> G L _ m ( F ) </m> for some field <m> F </m> ? in particular , what if <m> R </m> is the group ring <m> \mathbb { Z } D _ 8 </m> or <m> \mathbb { Z } _ 2 [ D _ 8 , t ^ { \pm 1 } ] </m> , where <m> D _ 8 </m> is the dihedral group of order 8 . thanks ! .

this is a notation question : if <m> A </m> is a set in a topological space and <m> \bar { A } </m> is its closure , is there a -LRB- standard -RRB- name for <m> \bar { A } \setminus A </m> ?
while reading `` automorphic forms and l-functions for the group <m> G L ( n , R ) </m> '' by d. goldfeld , i 've got a feeling that linear groups over <m> \mathbb { R } </m> and <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> are considered only as technical tools -LRB- beside their presence in the definitions -RRB- . the author often uses various decompositions such as iwasawa and bruhat , levi and langlands decomposition of parabolic subgroups , hermite and smith normal forms and other straightforward matrix calculations . but i do n't see if this works the other way around . the question is :

wolstenholme 's theorem is stated as follows : if <m> p > 3 </m> is a prime , then <m> \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { p - 1 } \frac { 1 } { k } \equiv 0 \pmod { p ^ 2 } , \, \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { p - 1 } \frac { 1 } { k ^ 2 } \equiv 0 \pmod { p } . </m> it is also not hard to prove that <m> \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { p - 1 } \frac { ( - 1 ) ^ k } { k ^ 2 } \equiv 0 \pmod { p } . </m> however , there are some relationships between <m> \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { p - 1 } \frac { ( - 1 ) ^ k } { k ^ 2 } </m> and <m> \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { p - 1 } \frac { 1 } { k ^ 2 } </m> mod <m> p ^ 2 </m> , which i can not prove . question : if <m> p </m> is an odd prime , then <m> 4 \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { p - 1 } \frac { ( - 1 ) ^ k } { k ^ 2 } \equiv 3 \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { p - 1 } \frac { 1 } { k ^ 2 } \pmod { p ^ 2 } . </m> i have verified this congruence for <m> p </m> upto <m> 7 9 1 9 </m> . comments : -LRB- 1 -RRB- since <m> 4 \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { p - 1 } \frac { ( - 1 ) ^ k } { k ^ 2 } = 2 \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { \frac { p - 1 } { 2 } } \frac { 1 } { k ^ 2 } - 4 \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { p - 1 } \frac { 1 } { k ^ 2 } , </m> we need to prove <m> 2 \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { \frac { p - 1 } { 2 } } \frac { 1 } { k ^ 2 } \equiv 7 \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { p - 1 } \frac { 1 } { k ^ 2 } \pmod { p ^ 2 } . </m> this idea was given by fedor petrov . -LRB- 2 -RRB- it is interesting that the congruence in the question is ture mod <m> p ^ 3 </m> for <m> p \ge 7 </m> , i.e. , <m>  </m> p \ ge 7 <m>  </m> this was conjectured by tkr . i appreciate any proofs , hints , or references !
consider the ring of formal power series <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p [ [ T ] ] </m> -LRB- where <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> denotes the ring of <m> p </m> - adic integers -RRB- with the topology in which a neighborhood basis for <m> 0 </m> is given by the ideals <m> I _ { n , m } = \left < p ^ n , T ^ m \right > </m> . is <m> 1 + T </m> a topological generator for <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p [ [ T ] ] </m> -LRB- i.e. , is <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p [ [ T ] ] </m> the minimal closed subring containing <m> 1 + T </m> -RRB- ?

consider the group <m> G L _ n ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> with its standard topology . it is not hard to show that there exists riemannian metrics on it which are left - <m> G L _ n </m> and right - <m> O _ n </m> invariant . -LRB- in fact it 's possible to describe all of them explicitly -RRB- . an immediate corollary is that there exists left - <m> G L _ n </m> and right - <m> O _ n </m> invariant metrics -LRB- in the sense of metric spaces -RRB- which generate the standard topology on <m> G L _ n </m> . question : does every left - <m> G L _ n </m> and right - <m> O _ n </m> invariant metric -LRB- which generates the standard topology on <m> G L _ n </m> -RRB- come from a riemannian metric ? i suspect the answer is negative . a possible idea is the following : take two different riemannian metric <m> g _ 1 , g _ 2 </m> which possess the above symmetries , and denote by <m> d _ 1 , d _ 2 </m> the corresponding distances . now define <m> d = d _ 1 + d _ 2 </m> , then it seems unlikely that <m> d </m> will be induced from a riemannian metric . -LRB- at least it is quite reasonable that it wo n't be induced by combinations like the <m> a g _ 1 + b g _ 2 </m> -RRB- . a criterion for when a given distance is induced by a riemannian metric which seems relevant is given here , but i am not sure if it 's possible to verify it . -LRB- for instance how do we know if every such metric is a path metric -RRB- .
this recently published paper <m> ^ { 1 } </m> claims the following remarkable identity : <m> P ( s ) = 1 - \sqrt { \frac { 2 } { \zeta ( s ) } - \sqrt { \frac { 2 } { \zeta ( 2 s ) } - \sqrt { \frac { 2 } { \zeta ( 4 s ) } - \sqrt { \frac { 2 } { \zeta ( 8 s ) } - . . . } } } } , </m> for integer <m> s > 1 </m> , where <m> \zeta ( s ) </m> is the riemann zeta function defined as <m> \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { 1 } { n ^ s } </m> and <m> P ( s ) </m> denotes the prime zeta function <m> \sum _ { p \in \mathbb { P } } ^ \infty \frac { 1 } { p ^ s } </m> , and <m> \mathbb { P } </m> is the set of prime numbers . i am not a number theoretician , but the paper looks like it might contain some errors . i have already raised the question here , and it looks like i may be right . however , after performing some calculations using wolfram alpha , it looks like the identity might have some truth to it . if we denote by <m> \epsilon ( s ) </m> the error term <m> P ( s ) - \left ( 1 - \sqrt { \frac { 2 } { \zeta ( s ) } - \sqrt { \frac { 2 } { \zeta ( 2 s ) } - . . . } } \right ) </m> , we get the following results for successive finite approximations to the nested radical , in which the <m> k ^ { \rm t h } </m> approximation is <m> \sqrt { \frac { 2 } { \zeta ( s ) } - \sqrt { \frac { 2 } { \zeta ( 2 s ) } - \sqrt { . . . - \sqrt { \frac { 2 } { \zeta ( 2 ^ { k - 1 } s ) } } } } } </m> , and in this case by taking <m> s = 2 </m> : \ begin -LCB- array -RCB- -LCB- | c | c | -RCB- \ hline k & \ epsilon -LRB- 2 -RRB- \ \ \ hline 3 & 0.19732 \ ldots \ \ \ hline 4 & -0.13198 \ ldots \ \ \ hline 6 & 0.04839 \ ldots \ \ \ hline 5 & -0.035665 \ ldots \ \ \ hline 7 & 0.007512 \ ldots \ \ \ hline 8 & -0.013753 \ ldots \ \ \ hline 9 & -0.00304 \ ldots \ \ \ hline \ end -LCB- array -RCB- so indeed it looks like <m> \epsilon ( 2 ) </m> is converging to <m> 0 </m> -LRB- note the expression `` looks like '' , as i have not run any calculations for really large <m> k </m> -RRB- . additionally , by taking <m> s = 3 </m> the identity above would remarkably imply that : <m> \zeta ( 3 ) = 2 \left ( ( 1 - P ( 3 ) ) ^ 2 + \sqrt { \frac { 2 } { \zeta ( 6 ) } - \sqrt { \frac { 2 } { \zeta ( 1 2 ) } - \sqrt { \frac { 2 } { \zeta ( 2 4 ) } - . . . } } } \right ) ^ { - 1 } , </m> and indeed taking the finite nested radical approximation for <m> k = 9 </m> , the error term is already <m> \epsilon = - 0 . 0 0 2 5 1 6 \ldots </m> and seems to approach <m> 0 </m> as <m> k \to \infty </m> -LRB- note again the expression `` seems to '' -RRB- . is it possible that the identity still holds , nonwithstanding the issues in the paper , and if so , how may one prove it ? or do the approximations for large <m> k </m> actually not produce <m> \epsilon \to 0 </m> ? if so , how can the apparent convergence be explained ?
let <m> F </m> be a meromorphic function on <m> \mathbb { C } </m> , and assume that the first-order theory of <m> ( \mathbb { C } , F ) </m> defines <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> , which means that there exists a formula <m> \varphi ( z ) </m> -LRB- in the language of fields , so we can not use complex conjugation , but parameters from <m> \mathbb { C } </m> are allowed -RRB- such that <m> \{ z \in \mathbb { C } \mid \varphi ( z ) \} = \mathbb { Z } </m> . -LRB- the last statement is not strictly first-order , but it can be made so : more precisely we can express that <m> \varphi </m> defines a cyclic group that happens to be <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> in the model <m> ( \mathbb { C } , F ) </m> -RRB- . now i propose the following statement :
the question : is the following formula known ? <m> \zeta ( 2 m + 1 ) = \frac { ( - 1 ) ^ m 2 ^ { 4 m + 2 } \pi ^ { 2 m } } { 2 ^ { 2 m } - 1 } \sum \limits _ { k = 1 } ^ m \frac { ( 2 ^ { 2 k } - 1 ) b _ { 2 k } } { 2 ^ { 2 k } ( 2 k ) ! } \cdot \sum \limits _ { v = k } ^ m \frac { ( 2 ^ { 2 v - 2 k + 2 } - 1 ) B _ { 2 v - 2 k + 2 } B _ { 2 m - 2 v } ( \frac { 1 } { 2 } ) } { ( 2 ^ { 2 v + 1 } - 1 ) ( 2 v - 2 k + 2 ) ! ( 2 m - 2 v ) ! } </m> with <m> m \in \mathbb { N } </m> , the bernoulli numbers <m> B _ k </m> and the coefficient <m> b _ { 2 k } : = \frac { 1 } { 2 k } - \ln 2 - \sum \limits _ { v = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { \zeta ( 2 v ) } { 2 ^ { 2 v } ( k + v ) } </m> . some informations : the basis for the derivation of the formula above is the recursion <m> a _ m + \sum \limits _ { v = 1 } ^ m \binom { 2 m } { 2 v } ( 1 - \frac { 1 } { 2 ^ { 2 v } } ) a _ v = b _ { 2 m } </m> with <m> a _ m : = ( - 1 ) ^ m \frac { ( 2 m ) ! \zeta ( 2 m + 1 ) } { \pi ^ { 2 m } } </m> and the definition of <m> b _ { 2 m } </m> above . the derivation of this recursion is too much for a forum , hence i would like to point only to an already existing recursion developed by kurokawa -LRB- '' multiple sine functions and selberg zeta functions '' -RRB- : http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pja/1195512182 , page 62 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and page 63 above
the definition of generalized mean curvature on <m> C ^ 1 </m> hypersurfaces is given as follows : let <m> M </m> be a closed orientable <m> C ^ 1 </m> hypersurface in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { n + 1 } </m> and <m> \mu </m> be the <m> n </m> - dimensional hausdorff measure . we say the <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { n + 1 } </m> valued vector function <m> \textbf { H } </m> is a generalized mean curvature on <m> M </m> , if for any smooth vector fields <m> X \in \mathbb { R } ^ { n + 1 } </m> , the following identity holds : <m> \int _ { M } d i v _ M X d \mu = \int _ { M } X \cdot \textbf { H } d \mu , </m> where <m> \dim _ M X </m> is the tangential gradient , that is , if <m> e _ 1 , \cdots , e _ n </m> form an orthomormal tangent bundle on <m> M </m> , then <m> d i v _ M X = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n \nabla _ { e _ i } X \cdot e _ i </m> . my question is , is there a concrete example that <m> M </m> is only <m> C ^ 1 </m> and the generalized mean curvature can be constructed ? this question has constantly intrigued me for a long time . the first time when i was interested in this question was when i was reading the paper by micheal and simon http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpa.3160260305/abstract . in the paper , the authors introduced the generalized mean curvature possibly defined on very rough manifolds , and then they proved the generalized micheal-simon sobolev inequality . later on i constantly occured papers with the setting that the initial surface is just rectifiable and has bounded generalized mean curvature . i just do n't want things to be pused into the most general setting . as far as i know , even given a <m> C ^ { 1 , \alpha } </m> manifold , the generalized mean curvature can only be defined as a measure , and can not be written as a vector valued function , see https://eudml.org/doc/252366 . can anyone give me some concrete nontrivial examples , and why people study flows with such weak assumption ? for example , huisken and ilmanen deals with inverse mean curvature flow on <m> C ^ 1 </m> manifolds with bounded mean curvature , see https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1226090483 . i 've no idea what is the motivation ... i 'll really appreciate if anyone can share any ideas . thanks !
when <m> X </m> is a smooth scheme -LRB- over something of characteristic <m> 0 </m> -RRB- , one can exchange left and right <m> \mathcal { D } _ X </m> - modules -LRB- <m> \mathcal { D } _ X </m> means the sheaf of differential operators -RRB- by tensor with -LRB- resp . putting hom from -RRB- <m> \omega _ X </m> , the canonical sheaf of <m> X </m> . however , as i know , to do this , one need
although the question is easy to pose , i think some background will help to motivate it , so i 'll start with it . consider variables <m> X = ( X _ 1 , \ldots , X _ n ) </m> over a field <m> K </m> and the elementary symmetric functions <m> T = ( T _ 1 , \ldots , T _ n ) </m> in <m> X </m> . in other words <m> X </m> are the roots of the polynomial <m> Y ^ n + T _ 1 Y ^ { n - 1 } + \cdots + T _ n </m> . a polynomial <m> f </m> in <m> X </m> is symmetric is <m> f ( s X ) = f ( X ) </m> for any permutation <m> s </m> . here <m> s X : = ( X _ { s ( 1 ) } , \ldots , X _ { s ( n ) } ) </m> . then a basic fact is that if <m> f ( X ) </m> is symmetric , then <m> f ( X ) = g ( T ) </m> , for some polynomial <m> g </m> . it is reasonable to define an alternating polynomial to be <m> f </m> that satisfy <m> f ( s X ) = s i g n ( s ) f ( X ) </m> , where <m> s i g n ( s ) = \pm 1 </m> is the signature . the `` elementary '' alternating polynomial is the vandermonde polynomial <m> V ( X ) = \prod _ { i < j } ( X _ j - X _ i ) </m> , and any other alternating polynomial can be expressed as a polynomial in <m> T </m> and <m> V </m> . note that <m> V </m> is a square root of the discriminant <m> \Delta </m> of <m> Y ^ n + T _ 1 Y ^ { n - 1 } + \cdots + T _ n </m> and the discriminant has an explicit formula in terms of <m> T </m> using the sylvester matrix . that definition for alternating polynomials gives nothing interesting in characteristic <m> 2 </m> -LRB- because then <m> 1 = - 1 </m> -RRB- . the only definition that makes sense to me in characteristic <m> 2 </m> is : <m> f </m> is alternating if <m> f ( s X ) = f ( X ) + a d d . s i g n ( s ) </m> . here <m> a d d . s i g n ( s ) = 0 , 1 </m> is the additive signature , i.e. , equals <m> 1 </m> if <m> s </m> is odd and <m> 0 </m> if <m> s </m> is even . i already figured out what is the `` elementary '' alternating polynomial <m> u / V </m> and what is the artin-schreir equation it satisfies : <m> u ( X ) = \sum _ { s \ { \rm i s \ e v e n } } X ^ { n - 1 } _ { s ( 1 ) } \cdots X ^ 0 _ { s ( n ) } </m> and it satisfies the artin-schreier equation <m> X ^ 2 + X = \frac { u ( X ) u ( s _ 0 X ) } { \Delta } </m> , where <m> s _ 0 </m> is any odd permutation -LRB- e.g. , transposition -RRB- , and <m> \Delta </m> is again the discriminant . -LRB- note that <m> u ( X ) + u ( s _ 0 X ) = V </m> . -RRB- my question is : does there exist a nice formula for <m> \frac { u ( X ) u ( s _ 0 X ) } { \Delta } </m> in terms of <m> T </m> ?
by an orthogonal embedding of a finite simple graph i mean an embedding in <m> \mathbb R ^ 3 </m> such that each edge is parallel to one of the three axis . to avoid trivialities , let 's require that -LRB- the embeddings of -RRB- two edges may not have any points in common , except obviously a shared vertex . it is clear that orthogonal embeddings can only exist for triangle-free graphs , i.e. graphs of girth at least <m> 4 </m> . here are examples of such embeddings for the dodecahedral graph -LRB- take a regular dodecahedron and `` flatten '' some edges to `` fit '' it onto one of the inscribed cubes -RRB- , the truncated octahedral graph and the nauru graph <m> G P ( 1 2 , 5 ) </m> . for the nauru graph , note that the plane drawing -LRB- credits to the wolfram page -RRB- is indeed a projection of a lattice structure existing in <m> \mathbb R ^ 3 </m> . -LRB- this would not be the case for the following plane drawing of <m> K _ { 3 , 3 } </m> . -RRB- such an embedding of a triangle-free cubic graph should exist at least if the graph is planar , which should be easy to show by starting with a polyhedron embedded in <m> \mathbb R ^ 3 </m> and then `` flattening '' parts of that polyhedron in appropriate ways -LRB- like for the dodecahedron or the truncated octahedron above -RRB- , though i have no idea how this could be formalized . as usual in graph theory , the petersen graph is a counterexample . for if you take a <m> C _ 6 </m> of the petersen graph , each pair of opposite vertices has a common neighbor . from this it follows easily that in an orthogonal embedding in <m> \mathbb R ^ 3 </m> , each <m> C _ 6 </m> must lie in a plane , and thus the whole graph -LRB- since any <m> K _ { 2 , 1 } </m> belongs to two <m> C _ 6 </m> 's -RRB- . now in <m> \mathbb R ^ 2 </m> an orthogonal embedding is obviously impossible . btw , the same argument applied to <m> K _ { 3 , 3 } </m> forces the plane embedding drawn above , showing that <m> K _ { 3 , 3 } </m> has no orthogonal embedding in <m> \mathbb R ^ 3 </m> . now if we take the cube graph and add an edge joining the midpoints of two opposite edges or of two `` skew '' edges : no way to embed this orthogonally . all this raises the question :
let <m> E </m> be a elliptic curve without complex multiplication over a number field <m> F </m> . let <m> F _ n = F [ E _ { p ^ n } ] </m> and <m> F _ { \infty } = F [ E _ { p ^ \infty } ] </m> . so by a well know theorem of serre , the galois group <m> G a l ( F _ \infty / F ) </m> is an open subgroup of <m> G L _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } _ p ) </m> . now suppose <m> E </m> has good ordinary reduction over any place <m> v </m> of <m> F </m> over <m> p </m> . let <m> \omega </m> be a prime of <m> F _ { \infty } </m> over <m> v </m> . then i know from the work of coates and howson here , that the decomospostion subgroup <m> D ( \omega | v ) </m> embeds into upper triangular matrices of <m> G L ( 2 , \mathbb { Z } _ p ) </m> and that the cohomological <m> p </m> - dimension of <m> D ( \omega | v ) </m> is <m> 3 </m> . this is also the dimension as <m> p </m> - adic lie group by lazard since it contains no elements of order <m> p </m> -RRB- is anything known about the inertia subgroup <m> I ( \omega | v ) </m> . what is its cohomological <m> p </m> - dimension -LRB- or dimension as a <m> p </m> - adic lie group -RRB- ?? i guess that <m> I ( \omega | v ) </m> should have dimension <m> 2 </m> because <m> D ( \omega | v ) / I ( \omega | v ) \cong G a l ( k _ { \omega } / k _ v ) </m> where <m> k _ { \omega } </m> -LRB- and <m> k _ v </m> -RRB- are residue fields of the completion of <m> F _ { \infty } </m> -LRB- and <m> F </m> -RRB- at prime <m> \omega </m> -LRB- and <m> v </m> -RRB- . the galois group of the residue fields should be generated topologically by some frobenius and hence will be of dimension <m> 1 </m> . therefore the inertia group <m> I ( \omega | v ) </m> should have dimension <m> 2 </m> as a <m> p </m> - adic lie group . is my argument correct ? thanks for help .
suppose you have a closed <m> m </m> - dimensional manifold <m> M </m> , which embeds in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { n + 1 } </m> for some <m> n </m> . can it have a closed submanifold <m> N </m> -LRB- of dimension strictly smaller than <m> m </m> -RRB- which does not embed in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> ? -LRB- by which i mean there is no embedding , not just that the restriction/projection of the first one does n't work . -RRB- i 'm not sure how important the dimension of <m> N </m> is ; it seems like codimension 1 would be the easiest place to find an example , but i 'm also interested in higher codimension examples . in fact , is there an upper limit to the codimension in which such examples can exist ? i would particularly like a codimension 1 example where both <m> M </m> and <m> N </m> are orientable . or an example -LRB- orientable or not -RRB- for <m> n = 2 </m> or <m> 3 </m> , but maybe there are obstructions in low dimensions ... i am primarily thinking about smooth manifolds , but examples in the topological category would also be interesting .
let <m> U \mapsto U \otimes U ^ * \otimes U \otimes U ^ * </m> be a unitary representation of the unitary group <m> U ( n ) </m> acting on the vector space <m> V </m> -LRB- where <m> U ^ * </m> is the complex conjugate of <m> U </m> -RRB- . we can decompose <m> V </m> into invariant subspaces in which the representation is irreducible . let <m> P _ i </m> 's be projectors onto invariant subspaces . i want to find these projectors explicitly and use them in a numerical calculation . is there any way to do this ? like an algorithm for generating them numerically ?
i stuck in determining the expected value of the following product <m> E [ W _ { t _ i } W _ { t _ { i + 1 } } ^ 2 ] </m> where <m> W _ { t _ i } </m> and <m> W _ { t _ { i + 1 } } </m> are brownian with normal distribution , i.e. <m> W _ { t _ i } \sim N ( 0 , t _ i ) </m> . i would appreciate if anybody give me a hint about this .
given a map <m> f : S \to M </m> of smooth manifolds , bott & tu define on page 78 a complex by <m> \Omega ^ q ( f ) = \Omega ^ q ( M ) \oplus \Omega ^ { q - 1 } ( S ) </m> and <m> d ( \omega , \theta ) = ( d \omega , f ^ * \omega - d \theta ) </m> where <m> f ^ * \omega </m> is the usual pullback of forms , and the <m> d </m> 's denote the appropriate exterior derivatives . they then prove that there is a long exact sequence in de rham cohomology <m> \cdots \to H ^ { q } ( f ) \xrightarrow { \beta ^ * } H ^ { q } ( M ) \xrightarrow { f ^ * } H ^ { q } ( S ) \xrightarrow { \alpha ^ * } H ^ { q + 1 } ( f ) \to \cdots </m> where <m> f ^ * </m> is the usual pullback on forms , <m> \alpha ^ * </m> is induced by the obvious insertion into the first component <m> \Omega ^ q ( S ) \hookrightarrow \Omega ^ q ( f ) ) </m> , and <m> \beta ^ * </m> is induced by the obvious projection <m> \Omega ^ q ( f ) \to \Omega ^ q ( M ) </m> onto the first component . moreover , <m> H ^ q ( f ) </m> and <m> H ^ q ( g ) </m> are isomorphic as algebras if <m> f </m> and <m> g </m> are homotopic maps . in the case where <m> f : S \to M </m> is a submanifold embedding , then this de rham group <m> H ^ q ( f ) </m> is just the usual relative cohomology <m> H ^ q ( M , S ; \mathbb { R } ) </m>
i have a question concerning classical invariant theory . consider binary <m> n </m> - forms -LRB- i.e. all homogeneous polynomials of degree <m> n </m> of two variables -RRB- over the field of complex numbers . clearly , the group <m> G L ( 2 , C ) </m> acts on the space of all such forms by changes of the variables . a classical relative invariant is a polynomial function <m> I </m> in the coefficients of the form such that under the <m> G L ( 2 , C ) </m> action the value of <m> I </m> changes only by multiplication by <m> \det C </m> to some power <m> k </m> -LRB- <m> k </m> is called the weight of <m> I </m> -RRB- . one can now form rational absolute invariants by taking ratios of relative invariants of equal weights . my question is : <m> G L ( 2 , C ) </m> - orbits of what forms can be distinguished by such rational absolute invariants ? how about forms with non-zero discriminant , for example ? i have found some classical results by clebsch of the 19th century and a result by olver of 1990 , but they do not quite give the result that i want . also , geometric invariant theory seems to deal only with <m> S L ( 2 , C ) </m> - actions . for <m> S L ( 2 , C ) </m> - actions the orbits can be distinguished just by polynomial invariants , but this is a completely different situation . in some cases -LRB- e.g. for quintics -RRB- i can prove what i need , but i am wondering if there is perhaps a general result .
let <m> p : X = \mathbb P ( \mathcal E _ 2 ) \rightarrow G r ( 2 , n + 1 ) </m> be the universal family of the lines in <m> \mathbb P ^ n </m> . if we denote <m> e : X \rightarrow \mathbb P ^ n </m> the natural projection , we have <m> \mathcal O _ { \mathcal E _ 2 } ( 1 ) = e ^ * \mathcal O _ { \mathbb P ^ n } ( 1 ) </m> . it seems that <m> X </m> is isomorphic to <m> \mathbb P ( T _ { \mathbb P ^ n } ) </m> , <m> e </m> being the projection , and that <m> \mathcal O _ { T _ { \mathbb P ^ n } } ( 1 ) = p ^ * \mathcal O _ { G r ( 2 , n + 1 ) } ( 1 ) </m> where <m> \mathcal O _ { G r ( 2 , n + 1 ) } ( 1 ) </m> is the polarization given by the plücker embedding . but it seems not to be true since when i compute the first chern class of <m> X </m> using the first description i get <m> c _ 1 ( T _ X ) = ( n + 2 ) p ^ * c _ 1 ( \mathcal O _ { G r ( 2 , n + 1 ) } ( 1 ) ) + 2 e ^ * c _ 1 ( \mathcal O _ { \mathbb P ^ n } ( 1 ) ) </m> whereas using the second one i get <m> c _ 1 ( T _ X ) = n p ^ * c _ 1 ( \mathcal O _ { G r ( 2 , n + 1 ) } ( 1 ) ) + 2 ( n + 1 ) c _ 1 ( \mathcal O _ { \mathbb P ^ n } ( 1 ) ) </m> . so , where is my mistake ?
it 's pretty obvious that the space <m> L </m> of unimodular lattices <m> \Lambda \subset \mathbb C </m> is a complement of trefoil knot : <m> S ^ 3 \setminus T </m> . consider a flow <m> f _ t : = \left ( \begin {array} { c c c } e ^ t & 0 \\ 0 & e ^ { - t } \end {array} \right ) </m> on <m> \mathbb C = \mathbb R ^ 2 </m> . it induces flow <m> F _ t </m> on <m> L </m> . -LRB- of course , there 's whole <m> U ( 1 ) </m> of flows <m> e ^ { i \phi } f _ t </m> . -RRB- let 's take a look at orbits ; some natural questions arise .
i have discovered -LRB- and found an elementary proof of -RRB- the following <m> \zeta ( 2 k ) = ( - 1 ) ^ { k - 1 } \dfrac { \pi ^ { 2 k } } { 2 ^ { 4 k } - 2 ^ { 2 k } } \left [ k \dfrac { 2 ^ { 2 k } } { ( 2 k ) ! } + { \displaystyle \sum _ { l = 1 } ^ { k - 1 } ( - 1 ) ^ { l } \dfrac { 2 ^ { 2 k - 2 l } } { ( 2 k - 2 l ) ! } \dfrac { 2 ^ { 4 l } - 2 ^ { 2 l } } { \pi ^ { 2 l } } \zeta ( 2 l ) } \right ] </m> -LRB- <m> k = 1 , 2 , 3 , \dots </m> -RRB- my questions are :
let <m> F </m> be a group which is strongly type <m> F _ \infty </m> in the sense that every subgroup is of type <m> F _ \infty </m> . here , type <m> F _ \infty </m> means that the group admits a classifying space with compact skeleta . consider the semidirect product <m> B _ k \ltimes F ^ k </m> where <m> B _ k </m> is the braid group on <m> k </m> strands . think of its elements as braids with strands labelled with elements of <m> F </m> . it is of type <m> F _ \infty </m> because <m> B _ k </m> and <m> F </m> are of type <m> F _ \infty </m> and -LRB- semi -RRB- direct products of type <m> F _ \infty </m> groups are of type <m> F _ \infty </m> . let <m> H , G < F </m> be subgroups . then the subgroups <m> B _ k \ltimes H ^ k </m> and <m> B _ k \ltimes G ^ k </m> of <m> B _ k \ltimes F ^ k </m> are of type <m> F _ \infty </m> because <m> H </m> and <m> G </m> are . also , the intersection <m> B _ k \ltimes H ^ k \cap B _ k \ltimes G ^ k </m> is of type <m> F _ \infty </m> because it is <m> B _ k \ltimes ( H \cap G ) ^ k </m> . now let <m> \alpha \in F ^ k </m> . i guess that the intersection <m> \alpha ( B _ k \ltimes H ^ k ) \alpha ^ { - 1 } \cap ( B _ k \ltimes G ^ k ) </m> is of type <m> F _ \infty </m> . is it true ? is there an easy argument ?
lately , i have been constructing finite involution monoids that generate varieties with <m> 2 ^ { \aleph _ 0 } </m> subvarieties . one construction requires groups that violate the identity <m> { [ x , y ] ^ 2 \approx 1 } </m> , where <m> { [ x , y ] = x ^ { - 1 } y ^ { - 1 } x y } </m> . is there a name for groups satisfying the identity <m> { [ x , y ] ^ 2 \approx 1 } </m> ? has there been any work done on these groups ?
suppose <m> A , \, B </m> are -LRB- possibly noncommutative -RRB- rings , and <m> G L _ n ( - ) </m> is the group of invertible <m> n \times n </m> matrices over a given ring . suppose <m> f : A \to B </m> is surjective , does it necessarily follow that <m> f _ \ast : G L _ n ( A ) \to G L _ n ( B ) </m> is surjective for <m> n > 1 </m> ? if not , why not ? i know that this need not be true for <m> n = 1 </m> , but is true for the subgroup <m> E _ n ( - ) </m> generated by elementary matrices . if it is n't true in general , are there any conditions upon the rings or homomorphism that ensures this is true ?
let <m> \mathbb { H } \subset \mathbb { C } </m> be the upper half plane . first recall the following statement : if <m> f ^ * \colon \mathbb { H } \rightarrow \mathbb { H } </m> is quasi-conformal -LRB- qc -RRB- , then there exists an extension <m> \overline { f ^ * } \colon \overline { \mathbb { H } } \rightarrow \overline { \mathbb { H } } </m> of <m> f ^ * </m> . note that this is an extension in the following sense : we do not -LRB- neccessarily -RRB- have <m> \overline { f ^ * } = f ^ * </m> on <m> \mathbb { H } </m> but they are conformally eqiuvalent , i.e. they are equal after composing with a conformal map . now fix a fuchsian group <m> \Gamma </m> so that <m> \mathbb { H } / \Gamma </m> is a compact riemann surface . a qc map <m> f \colon \mathbb { H } / \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb { H } / \Gamma _ f </m> to some other riemann surface has a qc lift <m> f ^ * \colon \mathbb { H } \rightarrow \mathbb { H } </m> . this map has an extension <m> \overline { f ^ * } </m> in the sense above . after composing it with a conformal map , we can assume that <m> \overline { f ^ * } </m> fixes 0 , 1 and <m> \infty </m> . by a version of the measurable riemann mapping theorem for the upper half plane , this map <m> \overline { f ^ * } </m> is then unique . i am intersted in the following statement : for two qc maps <m> f \colon \mathbb { H } / \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb { H } / \Gamma _ f </m> and <m> g \colon \mathbb { H } / \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb { H } / \Gamma _ g </m> with the same domain but possibly different images we have the following : the composition <m> f \circ g ^ { - 1 } </m> is isotopic to a conformal map if and only if the lift extensions <m> \overline { f ^ * } </m> and <m> \overline { g ^ * } </m> agree on the real line . i proved the backwards direction but assuming that <m> f \circ g ^ { - 1 } </m> is isotopic to a conformal map , i do not know how to deduce equality of the extended lifts on <m> \mathbb { R } </m> . remark : i do not know for sure whether the statement is true but i stronly believe so . cheers !
i 've seen a bunch of definitions of spectra in the literature , and the fanciest seems to be the <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - category of spectra obtaining by `` stablizing '' the higher category of spaces , as in dag i. i do n't really understand this stabilization procedure yet and would like to connect this idea to the more concrete notions that i 've heard about , such as :
i am trying to understand the behaviour of <m> \int ^ \infty _ { - \infty } \frac { \xi ( 1 - i t ) } { \xi ( 1 + i t ) } h ( t ) \frac { d t } { t } </m> where <m> h </m> is a schwartz function on <m> \mathbb R </m> , and <m> \xi ( s ) </m> the completed riemann zeta function . clearly it is the quotient of zeta functions that is the most difficult to study . one knows certain things about <m> \zeta ( 1 + i t ) </m> , for example the pole at <m> t = 0 </m> and the nonvanishing for all <m> t </m> . -LRB- see this question , also the paper referenced in the answer to this question . -RRB- but what can we say about this quotient , at least on average , say ?
suppose a continuous function <m> f : [ 0 , 1 ] \to \mathbb { R } </m> satisfies the following equation for all <m> z \in \left ( 0 , \frac { 1 } { 2 } \right ) </m> , <m> \int _ z ^ { 2 z } [ f ( x ) - f ( z ) ] d x = 0 . </m> it is clear that a constant function <m> f ( x ) = c </m> satisfies it . i would like to prove that there are no other such continous functions . note : this is a missing part of a larger proof i 'm working on . i 've already verified that if <m> f </m> is a polynomial then it must be constant . any hints on how to prove it for arbitrary continuous functions would be appreciated .
let <m> V </m> be a finite-dimensional , complex vector space and set <m> \newcommand { \Gl } { \mathrm { G l } } G : = \Gl ( V ) \times \Gl ( V ) </m> . let <m> E : = \mathrm { E n d } ( V ) </m> and consider its coordinate ring <m> \mathbb C [ E ] </m> , the space of all polynomial functions on <m> E </m> . it is well-known -LRB- see 9.7 in claudio procesi 's book on lie groups -RRB- that as a <m> G </m> - module , <m> \mathbb C [ E ] </m> decomposes as <m>  </m> where <m> \mathbb S _ \lambda </m> denotes the schur functor . now , simply by choosing a basis and restricting to permutation matrices , we have an action of <m> S : = S _ n \times S _ n </m> on <m> E </m> and therefore , also on <m> \mathbb C [ E ] </m> . hence , there must be some decomposition <m>  </m> where <m> \mathbb V _ \lambda </m> is the specht module and <m> N _ d ( \lambda , \mu ) \in \mathbb N </m> are certain multiplicities . my question is : what , if anything , is known about the <m> N _ d ( \lambda , \mu ) </m> ?
first the classical definition : a topological space <m> X </m> has the fixed point property -LRB- fpp -RRB- <m> \ \Leftarrow : \Rightarrow \ </m> for every continuous <m> \ f : X \rightarrow X \ </m> there exists <m> \ p \in X \ </m> such that <m> \ f ( p ) = p </m> . i 've introduced -LRB- in the early 1960s -RRB- a related relation <m> \ X \, F i x \, Y \ </m> for pairs of topological spaces : <m> X \, F i x \, Y \quad \Leftarrow : \Rightarrow \quad \forall _ { f : X \rightarrow Y , \ g : Y \rightarrow X } \, \exists _ { p \in X } \ ( g \circ f ) ( p ) = p </m> where <m> \ f \ g \ </m> are continuous . relation <m> \ F i x \ </m> is symmetric : <m> X \, F i x \, Y \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad Y \, F i x \, X </m> furthermore , the following 3 properties of a space <m> X </m> are equivalent :
when the <m> n </m> - sphere , <m> S ^ n </m> , admit a real polarization <m> D \subset T S ^ n </m>
it is wellknown that there is a convergence in norm for fourier series in <m> L _ p </m> , if <m> 1 < p < \infty </m> , but are there some examples for pointwise divergence if <m> p = 1 , \infty </m> in books , or somewhere ? i have only found kolmogorov example , but it is too complicated , and i do n't need divergence almost everywhere
let <m> F </m> be the discrete free group of rank 2 , and let <m> \widehat { F } </m> be its profinite completion , equipped with an embedding <m> i : F \hookrightarrow \widehat { F } </m> by a result of asada , this embedding induces a continuous injection <m> \widehat { \text { A u t } ( F ) } \hookrightarrow \text { A u t } \big ( \widehat { F } \big ) </m> , whose image is definitely not a normal subgroup . -LRB- one might call elements of the image `` nielsen '' automorphisms of <m> \widehat { F } </m> . -RRB- define <m> \text { I A u t } \big ( \widehat { F } \big ) : = \ker \left ( \text { A u t } \big ( \widehat { F } \big ) \rightarrow \text { A u t } \Big ( \widehat { \mathbb { Z } } ^ 2 \Big ) \right ) </m>
i was reading the book `` the structure of groups of prime power order '' . in the book -LRB- page 226 , example 10.1.18 -RRB- it is proved that <m> - 1 5 </m> has a square root is <m> \mathbb Z _ 2 </m> where <m> \mathbb Z _ 2 </m> denotes the ring of <m> 2 </m> - adic integers . -LSB- i have attached a screen-shot of example 10.1.18 at the end of my post -RSB- so suppose <m> a = \sqrt { - 1 5 } </m> , then for any integers <m> x , y </m> we have <m> x + y a \in \mathbb Z _ 2 </m> since <m> \mathbb Z \subset \mathbb Z _ 2 </m> . so my question is
let <m> X , Y </m> be topological spaces and let <m> \text { C o n t } ( X , Y ) </m> be the collection of continuous functions <m> f : X \to Y </m> . we say that a topology <m> \tau </m> on <m> \text { C o n t } ( X , Y ) </m> is admissible if the evaluation map <m> e : \text { C o n t } ( X , Y ) \times X \to Y ; \ ( f , x ) \mapsto f ( x ) </m> is continuous . is there an example of spaces <m> X , Y </m> such that the intersection of all admissible topologies on <m> \text { C o n t } ( X , Y ) </m> is no longer admissible ?
let <m> D </m> be a divisor in <m> \mathbb P ^ 2 _ { \mathbb C } </m> and let <m> X = \mathbb P ^ 2 _ { \mathbb C } - D </m> . under what condition on <m> D </m> is the fundamental group of <m> X </m> infinite ?
for <m> A = \begin {pmatrix} a _ 1 & b _ 1 \\ c _ 1 & d _ 1 \end {pmatrix} , B = \begin {pmatrix} a _ 2 & b _ 2 \\ c _ 2 & d _ 2 \end {pmatrix} \in M _ 2 ( \mathbb Z ) </m> , define <m> A * B : = a _ 1 L _ 1 B R _ 1 + b _ 1 L _ 1 B R _ 2 + c _ 1 L _ 2 B R _ 1 + d _ 1 L _ 2 B R _ 2 </m> , where <m> L _ 1 = I _ 2 = \begin {pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end {pmatrix} , L _ 2 = \begin {pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end {pmatrix} , R _ 1 = \begin {pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ - 1 & - 1 \end {pmatrix} , R _ 2 = - I _ 2 - R _ 1 </m> . is there an elegant/clever way to see that <m> ( M _ 2 ( \mathbb Z ) , + , * ) </m> forms a commutative ring with unity , where <m> + </m> is the usual matrix addition , and <m> * </m> acts as the multiplication ?
this question loosely builds on this one , however is a bit simpler and i found the results to be more robust . it seems that all zeros in the critical strip <m> 0 \lt \Re ( s ) < 1 </m> of : <m> L i _ s ( z ) \, \pm \, L i _ { 1 - s } ( z ) </m> reside on the critical line <m> \Re ( s ) = \frac 1 2 </m> for all <m> z \le - 1 </m> . below is a graph that shows where this function -LRB- using <m> \pm = - </m> -RRB- vanishes for <m> s = \frac 1 2 \pm t \, i </m> at different values of <m> z </m> . the lines marked in red all lead to a non-trivial zero of <m> \zeta ( s ) </m> , since <m> L i _ s ( - 1 ) = \eta ( s ) </m> , with <m> \eta ( s ) </m> being the dirichlet eta-function . i have extended the graph towards <m> z \rightarrow 0 ^ - </m> to also show how some lines continue in that domain , however there clearly are zeros off the critical line when <m> z > - 1 </m> -LRB- note : the lines coming from the left do n't have a ` hard stop ' at <m> z = - 1 </m> and actually continue a short bit further to the right -RRB- .
let <m> p \in [ 1 , \infty ] </m> and let <m> X </m> be a separable banach space . then <m> X </m> is said to be a <m> \mathscr { L } _ p </m> - space if there exists an increasing union of finite dimensional banach spaces <m> F _ n \subset F _ { n + 1 } \subset \ldots </m> with union dense in <m> X </m> such that for some <m> \lambda > 0 </m> the banach-mazur distance satisfies <m> d ( F _ n , \ell _ p ^ { \dim F _ n } ) \leqslant \lambda </m> for all <m> n </m> . many authors use without explanation the following definition : <m> X </m> is a <m> \mathscr { L } _ p </m> - space if there exists an increasing net <m> ( F _ \alpha ) </m> of finite-dimensional subspaces with <m> X = \bigcup _ \alpha F _ \alpha </m> such that for some <m> \lambda > 0 </m> the banach-mazur distance satisfies <m> d ( F _ \alpha , \ell _ p ^ { \dim F _ \alpha } ) \leqslant \lambda </m> for all <m> \alpha </m> .
it is easy to check that the functions <m> f _ { n , z } ( x ) : = ( z - x ) ^ { - n } , \quad n \geq 1 , \quad z \in \mathbb { C } - ( - \infty , 0 ] </m> belong to the hilbert space <m> L ^ 2 ( - \infty , 0 ) </m> , i.e. , <m> L ^ 2 </m> - integrable complex-valued functions on the open interval <m> ( - \infty , 0 ) </m> . i am interested to find out wether the vector subspace of <m> L ^ 2 ( - \infty , 0 ) </m> spanned by <m> f _ { n , z } </m> is dense .
this question may be kind of vague . and we use the same notations as in carayol 's papers : h. carayol , sur les représentations l-adiques associées aux formes modulaires de hilbert ; h. carayol , sur la mauvaise réduction des courbes de shimura . we know carayol constructed l-adic representation <m> \sigma </m> of <m> G a l ( \bar { F } / F ) </m> `` in '' the étale cohomology group of `` quaternionic '' shimura curves , roughly speaking , by taking some hecke `` eigenspace '' of <m> H _ { t } ^ 1 ( M _ K \times _ F \bar { F } , \mathcal { F } _ { \lambda } ) </m> . my question is could we get this galois representation from some unitary shimura curves ? more precisely , does <m> \sigma | _ { G a l ( \bar { E } / E ) } </m> appear in <m> H _ { t } ^ 1 ( M _ { K ' } ' \times _ E \bar { E } , \mathcal { F } _ { \lambda } ' ) </m> for some <m> K ' </m> , and some locally constant sheaf <m> \mathcal { F } _ { \lambda } ' </m> ? thanks !
this question has been asked by teimuraz pirashvili many years ago . i forgot about it after a while and remembered only now by accident . he probably knows the answer by now , but i still do n't . in the category of modules over a ring <m> R </m> , the module <m> R </m> is a projective generator . this property does not determine it uniquely , even up to isomorphism , but it does when <m> R </m> is commutative : it can be reconstructed as the ring of endotransformations of the identity functor . -LRB- for noncommutative <m> R </m> , it is still true that the category is equivalent to the category of modules over the endomorphism ring of any of its projective generators that may exist . -RRB- now what can be said about the structure sheaf <m> \mathcal O _ X </m> of a scheme <m> X </m> ? can it be detected inside the category of <m> \mathcal O _ X </m> - modules without using any additional structure ? of course it is the unit of the monoidal structure , but can it be also characterized as an object in a plain category , without invoking any additional structures ? can in fact the category of <m> \mathcal O _ X </m> - modules possess other non-isomorphic monoidal structures ? can it be equivalent to the category of <m> \mathcal O _ Y </m> - modules for some other scheme <m> Y </m> ? or , say , some analytic space , or whatever ? note that <m> \mathcal O _ X </m> is not even a generator - the subcategory generated by it is the category of quasicoherent sheaves . -LRB- nb as @heinrichd points out in the first comment , even that is wrong - this is only true locally , in the appropriate sense . -RRB- in any case , also in this category <m> \mathcal O _ X </m> is typically not projective . so the same question arises - is it some particular kind of generator ? there are of course several reconstruction theorems but i still can not figure out which -LRB- if any -RRB- of them provide answers to these questions . later - as pointed out by will sawin , i should be more clear . rather than modifying the question -LRB- i do n't quite understand how -RRB- let me try to formulate it once more :
i asked this question some months ago on math.stackexchange.com : https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/126810/a-graded-ring-r-is-graded-local-iff-r-0-is-a-local-ring it would be great -LRB- for me -RRB- to get it resolved . let <m> R </m> be a non-zero <m> \bf { Z } </m> - graded ring -LRB- with no commutativity assumptions whatsoever -RRB- . recall that <m> R </m> is `` graded-local '' if the following equivalent conditions hold :
suppose we have a <m> C ^ * </m> algebra <m> A = \{ ( x _ n ) \in \prod M _ n ( \Bbb C ) , l i m _ n t r _ n ( x _ n ^ * x _ n ) = 0 \} </m> . if <m> B </m> is any nonzero <m> C ^ * </m> - sub algebra of <m> A </m> , does there exist a finite dimensional irreducible representation of <m> B </m> ?
on pg . 151 of `` coxeter graphs and towers of algebras '' by f.m. goodman , p. de la harpe , and v.f.r. jones -LRB- 1989 -RRB- , it is stated that there is no known example of a full <m> I I _ 1 </m> factor having a subfactor of index <m> 4 \cos ^ 2 ( \pi / q ) </m> , <m> q \neq 3 , 4 , 6 </m> . -LRB- full means that the group of inner automorphisms is closed in the topology of pointwise strong convergence in the group of all automorphisms . for example , the <m> I I _ 1 </m> factor <m> W ^ * ( P S L ( 2 , \mathbb { Z } ) ) </m> is full . -RRB- is this statement still true , or has an example been found ?
let <m> X </m> be a smooth compact complex manifold of dimension <m> n </m> . suppose <m> L </m> is a line bundle on <m> X </m> such that <m> d i m ( H ^ 0 ( X , L ^ k ) ) > c \cdot k ^ n </m> for <m> c > 0 </m> and <m> k > > 0 </m> . question . is it true that <m> X </m> is moishezon ? is there some reference for this statement ?
for a morphism of schemes <m> f : X \rightarrow Y </m> , one often considers the function <m> f ^ * f _ * </m> on sheaves . for example , this appears in adjunction for sheaves of <m> \mathcal { O } _ X </m> - modules , the projection formula , and other relatively abstract places . as a somewhat vague question , i 'd like to see some non-trivial examples of how to interpret <m> f ^ * f _ * \mathcal { F } </m> , or typical examples where this is an important construction . how about the <m> f ^ * f _ * </m> map on sheaves in other sites , such as the etale site ? some context : 1 . -RRB- pullback of coherent sheaves is a fairly natural operation . i 'm also perfectly happy with the pushforwards and higher pushforwards . specifically , mumford -LRB- in `` abelian varieties '' -RRB- gives some fairly general results about how to interpret stalks of such sheaves -LRB- if <m> f </m> is proper flat and <m> \mathcal { F } </m> is locally free or more generally flat over <m> Y </m> -RRB- in terms of cohomology groups of <m> \mathcal { F } </m> on fibers . more generally the leray spectral sequence gives you a context to `` interpret '' higher pushforwards . if the pushforward of the structure sheaf is again the structure sheaf then stein factorization gives us information about the fibers . more generally we have the theorem of formal functions . 2 . -RRB- for finite degree <m> n </m> maps of smooth proper curves over <m> \bar { k } </m> , the related map <m> f _ * f ^ * </m> can be defined at the level of the picard group , where it is the multiplication by <m> n </m> map . <m> \textbf { Q u e s t i o n } </m> how should i think about thm iii .8.8 of hartshorne -LRB- below -RRB- ? is this just a useful technical result -LRB- and where ? -RRB- , or is it more than that ? are there good examples ? affine locally one can certainly describe the natural map <m> f ^ * f _ * ( \mathcal { F } ) \rightarrow \mathcal { F } </m> explicitly . is this how one `` works '' with it in practice , or are there better ways -LRB- i hope -RRB- ? <m> \textbf { T h m } </m> iii .8.8 : if <m> f : X \rightarrow Y </m> is a projective map of noetherian schemes , <m> \mathcal { F } </m> coherent on <m> X </m> and <m> \mathcal { O } _ X ( 1 ) </m> a very ample sheaf on <m> X </m> over <m> Y </m> , then <m> \forall n > > 0 </m> , the natural map <m> f ^ * f _ * ( \mathcal { F } ( n ) ) \rightarrow \mathcal { F ( n ) } </m> is surjective .
on page 52 of this paper , iwasawa considered the bilinear symmetric non-degenerate pairing <m> \Phi _ n \times \Phi _ n \rightarrow \mathbb { Q } _ p / \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> defined by <m> \langle \alpha , \beta \rangle _ n : = \text { t h e c l a s s o f } T _ n ( \alpha \beta ) \text { i n } \mathbb { Q } _ p / \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> where <m> \Phi _ n = \mathbb { Q } _ p ( \zeta _ n ) </m> , <m> \zeta _ n </m> being <m> p ^ { n + 1 } </m> - th root of unity and <m> T _ n </m> is the trace of the field extension <m> \Phi _ n / \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> . he then wrote
part 1 : a single finite place . let <m> K </m> be a finite extension of <m> \mathbf { Q } _ p </m> .
grothendieck 's galois theory , as developed in sga i , v. 4 , or very gently in lenstra 's notes , establishes an equivalence between profinite groups and galois categories . we can put this into the following more general framework : let <m> \mathsf { s e t s } </m> denote the category of finite sets ; for a topological group <m> \pi </m> let <m> \pi \mathsf { - s e t s } </m> denote the category of finite sets on which <m> \pi </m> acts continuously . there are functors <m> \mathsf { C a t } / \mathsf { s e t s } \leftrightarrow \mathsf { T o p G r p } ^ { \mathrm { o p } } </m> given by <m> ( F : C \to \mathsf { s e t s } ) \mapsto \mathrm { A u t } ( F ) </m> -LRB- which is topologized as a closed subgroup of <m> \prod _ { X \in C } \mathrm { A u t } ( F ( X ) ) </m> -RRB- and in the other direction by <m> \pi \mapsto \pi \mathsf { - s e t s } </m> . in order to avoid set-theoretic problems , <m> C </m> and <m> \pi </m> should be essentially small . there are canonical maps <m> \eta _ C : C \to \mathrm { A u t } ( F ) \mathsf { - s e t s } </m> and <m> \varepsilon _ { \pi } : \pi \to \mathrm { A u t } ( \pi \mathsf { - s e t s } ) </m> which satisfy the triangular identities ; hence we have an adjunction ! and every adjunction restricts to an equivalence of categories between its fixed points . now it 's fairly easy to recognize profinite groups as those fixed points on the right hand side , but grothendieck 's nontrivial insight is the classification of the fixed points on the left hand side , which he calls galois categories -LRB- in short : <m> C </m> has finite limits and colimits , which <m> F </m> preserves , there are mono-epi decompositions , monos split off , and <m> F </m> is conservative -RRB- . question 1 . does this point of view of grothendieck 's galois theory have already appeared somewhere ? my real question is the following : actually <m> \mathsf { C a t } / \mathsf { s e t s } </m> is a <m> 2 </m> - category . a morphism <m> ( C , F ) \to ( C ' , F ' ) </m> is a functor <m> P : C \to C ' </m> together with a chosen isomorphism <m> F \cong F ' P </m> . a <m> 2 </m> - morphism between morphisms <m> P , Q : C \to C ' </m> is a natural transformation of the underyling functors , which is base-point preservering in the obvious sense . question 2 . how can we endow <m> \mathsf { T o p G r p } ^ { \mathrm { o p } } </m> with the structure of a <m> 2 </m> - category in such a way that the adjunction above becomes an <m> 2 </m> - adjunction ? - - edit - - the comments + answers make me believe that it is just the `` trivial '' <m> 2 </m> - categorical enrichment with identities as <m> 2 </m> - morphisms . and since there is no reaction to q1 , i expect that the answer is `` no , this is new '' ?
in some calculations i am writing up , <m> \newcommand { \cR } { { \mathcal R } } </m> i want to add - as a fairly throwaway remark - that any countable product -LRB- = <m> \ell ^ \infty </m> - direct sum -RRB- of matrix algebras can be embedded inside <m> \cR </m> , the hyperfinite <m> { \rm I I } _ 1 </m> . i think i have managed to hack out an explicit embedding , by realizing <m> \cR </m> as an infinite tensor product of matrix algebras into which i embed successive blocks of my original product algebra , but the inductive construction seems both tedious and wasteful . assuming that i have not made a mistake , and that such product algebras do embed as von neumann subalgebras of <m> \cR </m> , does anyone know of a reference for this , so that -LRB- a -RRB- i do n't have to tax the reader 's patience by slogging through something tedious and routine -LRB- b -RRB- i can refer the reader to a better construction than the one i currently have ? moreover , my guess is that something slightly more general should hold : a finite type <m> { \rm I } </m> with separable predual should embed into <m> \cR </m> . again , does anyone know of a reference , or a counter-example if i have made a mistake ?
let <m> m > 1 </m> be an integer and let <m> p </m> be an odd prime . can we say something nontrivial about <m> f _ m ( p ) : = \left | \left \{ 1 \leqslant k < \frac p 2 : \ \left \{ \frac { k ^ m } p \right \} > \frac 1 2 \right \} \right | </m> -LRB- where <m> \{ x \} </m> denotes the fractional part of a real number <m> x </m> -RRB- ? question 1 . is it true that <m> f _ m ( p ) \sim p / 4 </m> -LRB- as <m> p \to \infty </m> -RRB- for each <m> m = 2 , 3 , 4 , \ldots </m> ? question 2 . is <m> f _ 5 ( p ) </m> always even for every prime <m> p \not \equiv 1 \pmod 5 </m> ? question 3 . is it true that <m> f _ 3 ( p ) \in \{ ( p + 1 ) / 6 + 2 n : \ n = 0 , 1 , 2 , \ldots \} </m> for each prime <m> p \equiv 5 \pmod 6 </m> ? question 4 . is it true that <m> f _ 6 ( p ) \in \{ ( p + 7 ) / 1 2 + 2 n : \ n = 0 , 1 , 2 , \ldots \} </m> for each prime <m> p \equiv 5 \pmod { 1 2 } </m> ? my computation suggests that all the four questions should have positive answers .
i am unaware of what the formal definition of `` limit '' is for a sequence of flats , but for the purpose of this question her is the definition of limit that i am using : consider a sequence <m> s _ 1 , s _ 2 , s _ 3 , </m> etc. where <m> s _ i </m> is a flat of <m> R ^ m </m> for all <m> i </m> . we will say that <m> l i m _ { n \to \infty } s _ n = S </m> if and only if for any point <m> p </m> on <m> S </m> and any positive value <m> \epsilon </m> , there exists a sufficiently large number <m> b </m> such that if <m> x > = b </m> , the minimum distance between <m> p </m> and <m> s _ x </m> will be no greater than <m> \epsilon </m> . here is my question : 1 -RRB- does there exist a homomorphism between the set of all n-flats in <m> R ^ m </m> to some manifold , for all n and m , and 2 -RRB- if so , to what manifold ? this question is partially motivated by a different question i asked earlier , where it was established that the set of all lines in a plane could not be continuously and bijectively represented by the set of all points in the plane , because the set of lines in a plane is homomorphic to an open mobius strip . continuous bijective way of representing a line on a plane note : i know very little topology , so i would appreciate it if people provided links if they refer to even `` well known '' theories .
hello , i 'd like some help to find an answer i 've been looking for since this morning . let <m> X </m> be a banach space and let <m> Y </m> be an <m> n </m> - codimensional subspace of <m> X </m> . let <m> P </m> be a projection from <m> X </m> onto <m> Y </m> . which is the best estimate for the norm of <m> P </m> ? i found this information in an article by bohnenblust as far as <m> n = 1 </m> is concerned -LRB- that is , there always exists a projection <m> P </m> such that <m> \| P \| \leq 2 + \varepsilon </m> -RRB- , but nothing satisfactory when the codimension increases . thank you .

there are several natural ways to endow the compactification of the space of marked riemann surfaces <m> M _ { g , n } </m> -LRB- <m> 2 g + n \geq 3 </m> -RRB- , with a topology , which is defined using `` differential geometric or analytic '' notions , e.g. the topology inherited from the `` augmented teichmüller space '' . as far as i understand , most of these natural topologies coincide , since the marked riemann surfaces -LRB- or the associated hyperbolic surfaces -RRB- are -LRB- sufficiently -RRB- rigid . on the other hand there is the classical deligne-mumford compactification of <m> M _ { g , n } </m> , the space of genus g nodal curves with n marked points , which inherits a natural topology as a projective variety . what is a good source which shows that the compactification of <m> M _ { g , n } </m> , endowed with any one of those `` analytic '' topologies , is homeomorphic to the deligne-mumford compactification ? sometimes this result is attributed to : harvey , william ; chabauty spaces of discrete groups . discontinuous groups and riemann surfaces -LRB- proc . conf. , univ. maryland , college park , md. , 1973 -RRB- , pp. 239 -- 246 . ann . of math . studies , no. 79 , princeton univ. press , princeton , n.j. , 1974 . but in my understanding this result is not really claimed or proved there , or if it is , then only in a quite implicit way . can anybody point me to some more explicit reference ? thanks !
in hhr , an important part is the periodicity theorem . for proving the theorem , they invert a carefully defined class <m> D \in \pi ^ { C _ 8 } _ { 1 9 \rho _ 8 } ( N ^ 8 _ 2 M U _ { \mathbb { R } } ) </m> and they can find an element in <m> x \in \pi _ { 2 5 6 } ^ { C _ 8 } D ^ { - 1 } N ^ 8 _ 2 M U _ { \mathbb { R } } </m> , when we forget the <m> C _ 8 </m> equivariant structure , gives a non-equivariant equivalence from <m> \Sigma ^ { 2 5 6 } D ^ { - 1 } N ^ 8 _ 2 M U _ { \mathbb { R } } </m> to <m> D ^ { - 1 } N ^ 8 _ 2 M U _ { \mathbb { R } } </m> . this non-equivariant equivalence is sufficient for them to show that the homotopy fixed point spectrum has the same periodicity . however , in a following paper , they claim in several places that the periodicity theorem they proved in hhr , shall gives us an equivariant equivalence , which is stronger than the original statement i have seen in the kervaire invariant one paper . so here is my question :
what is the cardinality of the continuous dual of <m> C ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) </m> -LRB- the set of continuous functions from <m> [ 0 , 1 ] \to \mathbb { R } </m> -RRB- ?
let <m> \mathbb { P } </m> some class forcing iteration which is absolute enough . for instance , suppose that <m> \mathbb { P } </m> is a <m> \Delta _ 1 </m> - definable class iteration . normally , this is the case for iteration of standard forcings like cohen , collapses and so on . my question is basically technical and its related with the degree of complexity of the forcing relation <m> \Vdash _ { \mathbb { P } } </m> . it is well-known that for set forcing notions <m> \mathbb { P } </m> the forcing relation <m> \Vdash _ { \mathbb { P } } </m> for <m> \Sigma _ n </m> - formulae -LRB- <m> n \geq 1 </m> -RRB- is <m> \Sigma _ n </m> - definable with <m> \mathbb { P } </m> as a parameter . on the contrary , if <m> \mathbb { P } </m> is a class this is not clear at all . notice that in this context the quantifiers over conditions are unbounded so probably the complexity increases . my question is the following : question : if <m> \mathbb { P } </m> is a <m> \Delta _ 1 </m> - definable class forcing iteration -LRB- suppose if you like that the iterates are cohen forcings of whatever standard -RRB- , then the forcing relation <m> \Vdash _ { \mathbb { P } } </m> for <m> \Sigma _ n </m> - formulae is also <m> \Sigma _ n </m> - definable ? if not , could you give a bound for its complexity ? thanks for your help !
suppose that i have a sequence of <m> n </m> i.i.d. chi-squared random variables with <m> k </m> degrees of freedom <m> X _ 1 , X _ 2 , \ldots , X _ n </m> , and denote <m> X _ { \max } = \max ( X _ 1 , X _ 2 , \ldots , X _ n ) </m> . let <m> k </m> be increasing but not as fast as <m> n </m> , i.e. <m> k = \omega ( 1 ) </m> and <m> n = \omega ( k ) </m> . i am wondering how far away <m> X _ { \max } </m> is from the rest of the sequence as <m> k \rightarrow \infty </m> . in particular , what is known about the asymptotics of the expected value <m> E [ \Delta ] </m> where <m> \Delta </m> is the fraction of the instances of the random variable in the sequence that are at least <m> \sqrt { k / \log ( n ) } </m> less than <m> X _ { \max } </m> -LRB- formally , <m> \Delta = | \{ X _ i : X _ i \leq X _ { \max } - \sqrt { k / \log ( n ) } \} | / n </m> -RRB- ? is <m> \lim _ { n \rightarrow \infty } E [ \Delta ] = 0 </m> or <m> \lim _ { n \rightarrow \infty } E [ \Delta ] = 1 </m> -LRB- i doubt it 's between zero and one -RRB- ?

this is related to my question https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/252742/transforming-the-dirac-operator-on-s1 on stack exchange which has not yet received an answer . for the purposes of this question , fix the spin structure over <m> S ^ 1 </m> to be given by the connected double cover . sections of the bundle of spinors on <m> S ^ 1 </m> can be thought of in two ways . first , by trivializing the bundle over <m> U _ 1 = S ^ 1 \setminus \{ i \} </m> and <m> U _ 2 = S ^ 1 \setminus \{ - i \} , </m> sections can be considered as pairs of real valued functions <m> f _ 1 , f _ 2 </m> defined on <m> \mathbb { R } </m> such that <m> f _ 1 ( \frac { 1 } { x } ) = f _ 2 ( x ) </m> when <m> x > 0 , </m> and <m> f _ 1 ( \frac { 1 } { x } ) = - f _ 2 ( x ) </m> when <m> x < 0 . </m> following lawson/michelson 's `` spin geometry , '' we can compute the dirac operator locally . for example , <m> f _ 1 \rightarrow i \frac { d f _ 1 } { d x } . </m> we can also identify the sections as function <m> f : S ^ 1 \rightarrow \mathbb { C } </m> such that <m> f ( - \theta ) = - f ( \theta ) </m> by the procedure described here https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/250835/expressing-the-sections-of-the-mobius-bundle-on-s1-as-globally-defined-real-v . when we identify sections this way , i have seen the dirac operator expressed as <m> f \rightarrow - i \frac { d f } { d \theta } . </m> however i have never seen a derivation of this fact from the local expression given above . my attempt at the computation is contained in the stack exchange link at the top of the page . can anyone tell me how to translate between these 2 points of view ?
is there a closed form sum of <m> \sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { x ^ k } { ( k ! ) ^ 2 } </m> it is trivial to show that it is less than <m> e ^ x </m> but is there a tighter bound ? thanks
denote by <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> a complex semisimple lie algebra and let <m> \mathfrak { h } </m> be a cartan subalgebra of <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> . denote by <m> \Phi </m> the root system of <m> ( \mathfrak { g } , \mathfrak { h } ) </m> and denote by <m> \mathfrak { g } _ \alpha </m> the root subspace of <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> corresponding to a root <m> \alpha </m> . we fix a choice of the set of positive roots <m> \Phi ^ + </m> , and let <m> \Delta </m> be the corresponding subset of simple roots in <m> \Phi ^ + </m> . note that each subset <m> I \subseteq \Delta </m> generates a root system <m> \Phi _ I \subseteq \Phi </m> , with positive roots <m> \Phi _ I ^ + = \Phi _ I \cap \Phi ^ + </m> . there are a number of subalgebras of <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> associated with the root system <m> \Phi _ I </m> . let <m> \mathfrak { l } _ I = \mathfrak { h } \oplus \sum _ { \alpha \in \Phi _ I } \mathfrak { g } _ \alpha </m> be the levi subalgebra and let <m> \mathfrak { u } _ I = \sum _ { \alpha \in \Phi ^ + \backslash \Phi _ I ^ + } \mathfrak { g } _ \alpha </m> be the nilpotent radical . then <m> \mathfrak { p } _ I = \mathfrak { l } _ I \oplus \mathfrak { u } _ I </m> is the standard parabolic subalgebra . we note that once <m> I </m> is fixed , there is little use for other subsets of <m> \Delta </m> . therefore , we omit the subscript if a subalgebra is obviously associated to <m> I </m> . the category <m> \mathcal { O } ^ \mathfrak { p } </m> is the full subcategory of <m> U ( \mathfrak { g } ) </m> - mod such that every object <m> M </m> in category <m> \mathcal { O } ^ \mathfrak { p } </m> satisfies the following conditions . 1 . <m> M </m> is a finitely generated <m> U ( \mathfrak { g } ) </m> - module . 2 . <m> M </m> is a direct sum of finite-dimensional simple <m> U ( \mathfrak { l } ) </m> - modules . 3 . <m> M </m> is locally finite as a <m> U ( \mathfrak { p } ) </m> - module . i have search the notation : locally finite . i get the following : locally finite modules <m> M </m> are modules whose finitely generated submodules are finite -LRB- as sets -RRB- . i would like to know is that the correct definition for the locally finite in the definition of <m> \mathcal { O } ^ \mathfrak { p } </m> , secondly , i would like to know what is the intuitions/motivations for one to define <m> \mathcal { O } ^ \mathfrak { p } </m> in such a way . other two conditions seems more natural than the third one to me .
background the upper and lower maslov dequantizations are respectively the limits <m> h \downarrow 0 </m> and <m> h \uparrow 0 </m> of deformations of the semifield <m> ( \mathbb { R } _ + , + , \cdot ) </m> defined for <m> 0 \ne h \in \mathbb { R } </m> by the map <m> \Phi _ h ( x ) : = h \log x </m> which sends <m> \mathbb { R } _ + </m> to <m> \mathbb { R } \cup \{ - \sigma ( h ) \cdot \infty \} </m> . since the map <m> \Phi _ h </m> is invertible , it defines deformed addition and multiplication operations : i.e. , <m> u + _ h v : = \Phi _ h ( \Phi _ h ^ { - 1 } ( u ) + \Phi _ h ^ { - 1 } ( v ) ) ; \quad u \cdot _ h v : = \Phi _ h ( \Phi _ h ^ { - 1 } ( u ) \cdot \Phi _ h ^ { - 1 } ( v ) ) . </m> explicitly , we have <m> u + _ h v : = h \log \left ( e ^ { u / h } + e ^ { v / h } \right ) ; \quad u \cdot _ h v : = h \log \left ( e ^ { u / h } \cdot e ^ { v / h } \right ) \equiv u + v . </m> now writing <m> \lozenge </m> for <m> \vee </m> when <m> h > 0 </m> and <m> \wedge </m> when <m> h < 0 </m> , it is easy to see that <m> ( \sum _ { ( h ) } ) _ { j \in [ n ] } u _ j : = u _ 1 + _ h \dots + _ h u _ n = h \log \sum _ { j \in [ n ] } e ^ { u _ j / h } = \lozenge _ j u _ j + h \log \sum _ j e ^ { ( u _ j - \lozenge _ k u _ k ) / h } </m> . clearly , as <m> h \rightarrow 0 </m> , this tends to <m> \lozenge _ j u _ j </m> . this is manifested in the figure below :

some isometric preduals of <m> \ell _ 1 </m> are of the form <m> C _ 0 ( K ) </m> where <m> K </m> is countable . i am wondering whether this is a general rule . question : is there a measure <m> \mu </m> and a -LRB- preferably separable -RRB- banach space <m> X </m> without a subspace isomorphic to <m> c _ 0 </m> which has <m> X ^ * = L _ 1 ( \mu ) </m> isometrically ? i apologise for three questions in a such short period of time . now i 'll take my time . edit : corrected according to philip 's remarks .
a field <m> K </m> is called ample if every smooth curve over <m> K </m> that has a <m> K </m> - point has infinitely many <m> K </m> - points . examples include fraction fields of henselian rings . -LRB- this is far from trivial , but was proven in the paper `` henselian implies large '' . `` large '' is a synonym for `` ample '' . -RRB- for example the field of <m> p </m> - adics , for any prime <m> p </m> , is ample . i have known for a long time that <m> \mathbb { Q } ^ { a b } </m> is conjectured to be ample , but i do n't know how much evidence there is for this conjecture . can you direct me to some references supporting this conjecture , or suggest heuristic arguments that would explain why this conjecture is reasonable ?
mcmullen 's <m> g </m> - conjecture aims the classify possible <m> f </m> - vectors of simplicial <m> d </m> - spheres . the <m> g </m> - conjecture has been proven for polytopal spheres and for simplicial spheres of dimension <m> d < 5 </m> . i am wondering what computer searches have been done to verify -LRB- if you are an optimist -RRB- or search for counter examples -LRB- if you are a pessimist -RRB- of the <m> g </m> - conjecture . the only attempt i know of was by björner and lutz and was reported in the paper simplicial manifolds , bistellar flips and a 16-vertex triangulation of the poincaré homology 3-sphere from 2000 . here it appears björner and lutz looked at some -LRB- non-pl -RRB- simplicial spheres of dimension <m> d = 5 , 6 </m> . i am curious if there have been any more attempts since 2000 , and -LRB- perhaps too ambitiously -RRB- if anyone has been able to make a statement like :
let <m> T O P </m> be the stable homeomorphism space , with <m> T O P ( n ) = H o m e o m o r p h i s m s ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) </m> . what is known about its <m> \mathbb { Z } _ 2 </m> - homology <m> H _ * ( T O P , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) </m> ? in particular i am interested in the map <m> H _ * ( T O P , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) \rightarrow H _ * ( G , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) </m> , where <m> G </m> is the stable space of homotopy automorphisms of spheres . can <m> H _ * ( T O P , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) </m> be computed knowing <m> H _ * ( G , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) </m> , <m> H _ * ( G / T O P , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) </m> or <m> H _ * ( B T O P , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) </m> ? my specific question : is the map <m> H _ { 4 k + 2 } ( T O P , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) \rightarrow H _ { 4 k + 2 } ( G , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) </m> injective on the image of <m> \pi _ { 4 k + 2 } ( T O P ) </m> under the hurewicz homomorphism ? so for example , is it injective on primitives ? does somebody have an idea or a reference i could look at ? even more specific -LRB- and also sufficient -RRB- : let <m> \kappa \in \pi _ { 1 4 } ^ s = \pi _ { 1 4 } G </m> be the element with kervaire invariant 0 . it lifts to <m> \pi _ { 1 4 } ( T O P ) </m> . is its image under <m> h : \pi _ { 1 4 } ( T O P ) \rightarrow H _ { 1 4 } ( T O P , \mathbb Z _ 2 ) </m> zero ? -LRB- by lemma 4.3 of arxiv.org/abs/1504.06752v2 , <m> h ( \kappa ) = 0 </m> in <m> H _ { 1 4 } G </m> . -RRB-

for a convex polygon <m> P </m> , draw all the diagonals of <m> P </m> and consider the intersection points made by those diagonals . let <m> f ( n ) </m> be the minimal number of such intersections where <m> P </m> ranges over all convex <m> n </m> - gons . -LRB- if three or more diagonals intersect at one point , we count it as a single point -RRB- for example , <m> f ( 3 ) = 0 </m> , <m> f ( 4 ) = 1 </m> , <m> f ( 5 ) = 5 </m> , but <m> f ( 6 ) = 1 3 </m> since there are only thirteen intersections in a regular hexagon .
i apologize that this question is a bit vague , however that is partially the point . in subsystems of second order arithmetic , one considers <m> \omega </m> - models , these are models of <m> \mathsf { R C A } _ 0 </m> whose first order part is <m> \omega = \mathbb { N } </m> and whose second order part is a subset of <m> 2 ^ \omega </m> closed under turing reduction and join . <m> \omega </m> - models have the following properties that i am interested in :
disclaimer : all pointclasses considered here are boldface . most of the time , when doing descriptive set theory , we want the projective sets to `` behave well ; '' for example , maybe we do n't want there to be nonmeasurable projective sets , or projective well orderings of <m> \mathbb { R } </m> , etc. generally , this means making some -LRB- fairly conservative -RRB- large cardinal assumption , or equivalent . at the far opposite end of things is the axiom that all sets are constructible , <m> V = L </m> . this axiom implies that there is a projective - in fact , <m> \Delta ^ 1 _ 2 </m> - well-ordering of the reals , and so projective sets become bad very early in the hierarchy . my question is about the state of affairs when <m> V = L </m> holds . my motivation is simply that i do n't feel i have a good grasp on basic concepts in descriptive set theory , and the following seemed like a good test problem to assign myself ; but i have thought about it for a while without making progress , so i 'm asking here : let <m> \oplus </m> be one of the usual pairing operators on <m> \omega ^ \omega </m> . for the purposes of this question , we say that a pointclass <m> \Gamma \subseteq \mathcal { P } ( \omega ^ \omega ) </m> has the uniformization property if whenever <m> A \in \Gamma </m> , there is some <m> B \in \Gamma </m> such that :
this theorem is obviously true if the set <m> X </m> is finite -LRB- so that <m> \mathop { \rm c o n v } X </m> is a convex polytope -RRB- . i believe it is true for any set <m> X \subseteq \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> but i can not prove it . can anybody please prove this or give a counter-example ? many thanks ! notes : <m> \mathop { \rm c o n v } X </m> denotes the convex hull of the set <m> X </m> . a face of a convex set <m> C </m> is defined to be a convex set <m> F \subseteq C </m> such that every line segment from <m> C </m> whose relative interior has a non-empty intersection with <m> F </m> is contained in <m> F </m> .
serre proved , that for -LRB- allmost -RRB- all <m> n , m \in \mathbb { N } </m> the homotopy groups <m> \pi _ n ( \mathbb { S } ^ m ) </m> are finite , so - using simplicial approximation - for <m> n , m </m> fixed there is a finite cell decomposition <m> \Sigma ^ n </m> of <m> \mathbb { S } ^ n </m> such that all maps <m> f : \mathbb { S } ^ n \rightarrow \mathbb { S } ^ m </m> can be represented -LRB- up to homotopy -RRB- by a simplicial map <m> \mathfrak { f } : \Sigma ^ n \rightarrow \mathfrak { X } ^ m </m> for any given -LRB- probably easy -RRB- simplicial structure <m> \mathfrak { X } ^ m </m> on <m> \mathbb { S } ^ n </m> . are there any known bounds on the size of such a simplicial decomposition and can these be used to gain information about the <m> \pi _ n ( \mathbb { S } ^ m ) </m> ? note , that this is a duplicate of https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2884130/how-many-cells-do-we-need-in-mathbbsn-to-induce-pi-n-mathbbsm , where i was adviced to post this question here .

what is known about the -LRB- <m> L ^ 2 </m> -RRB- spectrum of the minus laplace-beltrami operator -LRB- <m> - \Delta </m> -RRB- with zero boundary conditions on <m> B = H ^ n / \Gamma </m> , where <m> H ^ n </m> is <m> n </m> - dimensional hyperbolic space -LRB- <m> n > 1 </m> -RRB- , <m> \Gamma </m> is a discrete subgroup of the isometry group of <m> H ^ n </m> ? is it possible for the spectrum to be discrete for some <m> \Gamma </m> , when <m> B </m> has finite volume but is not -LRB- sub -RRB- compact ? if so , it could be generalized for a large class of -LRB- generic -RRB- <m> B </m> -LRB- with smooth boundary -RRB- of finite volume . -LRB- when the closure of <m> B </m> is compact the spectrum seems to be discrete . -RRB- are there universal bounds -LRB- from below -RRB- on the spectrum of -LRB- <m> - \Delta </m> -RRB- on <m> B </m> of finite volume -LRB- with smooth boundary -RRB- ? the case of special interest is <m> n = 2 </m> and <m> \Gamma = P S L ( 2 , { \mathbb Z } ) </m> - well-known modular group .
is there a known example of a completely regular c.c.c. space with <m> G _ \delta </m> - diagonal which is not productively c.c.c. ? the non-existence of such a space is consistent -LRB- for example , under <m> M A </m> no such space should exist . -RRB- this would entail , i 'm looking for a consistent example only ; unless of course it 's a theorem that completely regular c.c.c. spaces with <m> G _ \delta </m> - diagonal are productivity c.c.c. edit : removed not very well thought out question .

i have spent some time using gp-pari . there is , of course , a formal power series solution to <m> f ( f ( x ) ) = \sin x . </m> it is displayed below , identified by the symbol <m> g </m> because i am not entirely sure whether it is a function of anything . on the other hand , should the coefficients continue to -LRB- by and large -RRB- decrease , this suggests a nonzero radius of convergence . if the radius of convergence is nonzero , then inside that , not only is a function defined and , you know , analytic , but the functional equation is satisfied . indeed , all that is necessary is radius of convergence strictly larger than <m> \frac { \pi } { 2 } </m> owing to certain symmetries . for instance , given my polynomial <m> g , </m> it seems we have <m> g = 1 </m> at about <m> x \approx 1 . 1 4 . </m> then we seem to have a local maximum at <m> x = \frac { \pi } { 2 } , </m> and apparently there <m> g \approx 1 . 1 4 , </m> strictly larger than 1 which is an important point . so everything would fall into place with large enough nonzero radius of convergence . <m> \begin {array} { l l l } g & = & x - \frac { x ^ 3 } { 1 2 } - \frac { x ^ 5 } { 1 6 0 } - \frac { 5 3 x ^ 7 } { 4 0 3 2 0 } - \frac { 2 3 x ^ 9 } { 7 1 6 8 0 } - \frac { 9 2 7 1 3 x ^ { 1 1 } } { 1 2 7 7 3 3 7 6 0 0 } - \\ \ & & \\ \ & & \frac { 7 4 2 0 3 1 x ^ { 1 3 } } { 7 9 7 0 5 8 6 6 2 4 0 } + \frac { 5 9 4 6 7 3 1 8 7 x ^ { 1 5 } } { 1 6 7 3 8 2 3 1 9 1 0 4 0 0 0 } + \frac { 3 2 9 3 6 6 5 4 0 4 0 1 x ^ { 1 7 } } { 9 1 0 5 5 9 8 1 5 9 2 5 7 6 0 0 0 } + \\ \ & & \\ \ & & \frac { 1 0 4 4 9 1 7 6 0 8 2 8 5 9 1 x ^ { 1 9 } } { 6 2 2 8 2 2 9 1 4 0 9 3 2 1 9 8 4 0 0 0 } + \frac { 1 5 0 8 4 8 6 3 2 4 2 8 5 1 5 3 x ^ { 2 1 } } { 4 0 2 4 3 9 4 2 1 4 1 4 0 8 0 5 1 2 0 0 0 0 } + \cdots \end {array} </m> note that the polynomial <m> g </m> is smaller than <m> x </m> but larger that <m> \sin x , </m> for , say , <m> 0 < x \leq \frac { \pi } { 2 } . </m> so , that is the question , does the formal power series beginning with <m> g </m> converge anywhere other than <m> x = 0 </m> ? edit : note that the terms after the initial <m> x </m> itself have all turned out to be <m> \frac { a _ { 2 k + 3 } x ^ { 2 k + 3 } } { 2 ^ k ( 2 k + 4 ) ! } </m> where each <m> a _ { 2 k + 3 } </m> is an integer . this much seems provable , although i have not tried yet . edit , friday 12 november 2010 . it now seems really unlikely that this particular problem gives an analytic answer . i suspect that the answer is <m> C ^ \infty </m> and piecewise analytic , with failure of analyticity at only the points `` parabolic '' where the derivative has absolute value as large as 1 , those points being <m> 0 , \pi , 2 \pi , \ldots . </m> however , we need the anchor point at the fixpoint 0 , otherwise how to begin ? and i do think the power series will serve as an asymptotic expansion around 0 . given the problem with the size of the derivative , now i am hoping for great things , and an obviously periodic and analytic solution , to the easier variant <m> f ( f ( x ) ) = g ( x ) = ( 1 / 2 ) \sin x . </m> i would like both a nice power series and a nice answer by methods summing iterates <m> g ^ { [ k ] } ( x ) , </m> which for the moment is an entirely mysterious method to me , but attractive for periodic target functions as periodicity would be automatic .
let <m> k </m> be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic , let <m> G = S L _ 2 ( k ) </m> acting naturally on <m> V = k ^ 2 </m> , and let <m> S ^ r V </m> be the <m> r </m> - th symmetric power of the standard representation <m> V </m> . is it true that <m> H o m ^ G ( S ^ p V , S ^ q V ) \neq \{ 0 \} </m> if and only if <m> p = q </m> -LRB- in which case it is <m> \{ \lambda I d ; \lambda \in k \} </m> -RRB- ? the problem is that <m> S ^ p V </m> and <m> S ^ q V </m> can be reducible in positive characteristic and so strange things might happen . if yes , could someone please indicate a reference for this fact ? this is easily checked in characteristic zero , but i do n't see a straighfoward argument in positive characteristic . thank you in advance !
given a pair of non-commutative rings <m> ( R , S ) </m> , how to construct a faithfully semidualizing <m> ( R , S ) </m> - bimodule ? henrik holm and diana white introduced the concept of faithfully semidualizing bimodules in the paper named `` foxby equivalence over associative rings '' . semidualizing modules provide a generalization of a free module of rank one , that is , any ring <m> R </m> with a unit is a semidualizing module . semidualizing modules are also called generalized tilting modules -LRB- see wakamatsu , tilting modules and auslander 's gorenstein property , corollary 3.2 -RRB- . these modules share some of the basic properties with their subclass consisting of all tilting modules . it is still an open problem - known as the wakamatsu tilting conjecture - whether any wakamatsu tilting module of finite projective dimension is tilting . since faithfully semidualizing bimodules have more nice properties , we hope to find more examples . for more details , see holm , white , foxby equivalence over associative rings .

consider the groupoid generated by the category <m> \{ 0 \to 1 \to \cdots \to n \} </m> ; let 's call this category <m> \pmb \Delta ^ n </m> opposed to the category <m> \triangle ^ n </m> , which is `` thinner '' . i 'm trying to figure out what the classifying space -LRB- i.e. the geometric realization of the nerve <m> N \pmb \Delta ^ n </m> -RRB- looks like , given that the classifying space of <m> \triangle ^ n </m> is fairly `` simple '' to draw . more generally , is there any hope to relate the classifying space <m> \mathbb B \mathcal C </m> of a category to that of its groupoidification , in some non-trivial cases ? i believe that the most general problem is considerably more difficult to attack -LRB- describe <m> \mathbb B ( \mathcal C [ W ^ { - 1 } ] ) </m> given <m> \mathbb B \mathcal C </m> and <m> W \subset \text { M o r } \mathcal C </m> -RRB- , but any clue is accepted .

let <m> G </m> be a profinite group , and <m> M </m> a finite abelian group with trivial <m> G </m> - action . must there exist an open subgroup <m> H \le G </m> with <m> H ^ 2 ( H , M ) = 0 </m> ?
estimating <m> E [ X ] </m> from i.i.d. copies <m> X _ 1 , X _ 2 , \dotsc </m> of a random variable <m> X </m> with unknown distribution <m> P </m> is well studied , obviously . when <m> X </m> has extremely large variance , the monte carlo estimates <m> \frac 1 n \sum _ { j \le n } X _ j </m> will generally not have low enough variance to be useful in practice . moreover , one can not give any quantitative bounds on the accuracy of such estimates -LRB- even merely with high probability -RRB- without further assumptions . the problem seems to be made much easier if we 're willing to say that we do n't care about extreme events . one way to formalize this is to say that we 're actually interested in estimating <m> E [ X ; A ] = E [ X \, 1 _ A ] </m> for some set <m> A </m> such that <m> P ( A ) </m> is large . -LRB- alternatively , we may want a confidence interval . -RRB- we may even be willing to choose <m> A </m> to make the problem easier . -LRB- this relaxation of the problem is obviously not appropriate in all situations , but it does seem appropriate in the situation that led us to ask this question . -RRB- at this stage , we 're curious to hear about related work . the attack we 're considering is to use basic facts about order statistics , but we do n't want to reinvent the wheel .
the following question arose while i was trying to explore possible further extensions of a clt by liverani which i mentioned here already -LRB- see this link , i can tell you more details upon request -RRB- . it seems to be of a very technical nature but an answer is important to connect liverani 's -LRB- extended -RRB- theorem with very recent results on limit theorems . so , let <m> T : \Omega \to \Omega </m> be an ergodic , invertible transformation on a probability space <m> ( \Omega , \mathcal { F } , P ) </m> and let <m> \mathcal { F } _ { 0 } \subset \mathcal { F } </m> be a sigma field satisfying <m> \mathcal { F } _ { 0 } \subset T ^ { - 1 } \mathcal { F _ { 0 } } : = \{ T ^ { - 1 } A : A \in \mathcal { F } _ { 0 } \} </m> , so that <m> ( \mathcal { F } _ { n } ) _ { n \in \mathbb { Z } } </m> given by <m> \mathcal { F } _ { n } : = T ^ { - n } \mathcal { F } _ { 0 } </m> defines an increasing filtration of sigma fields contained in <m> \mathcal { F } </m> . denote by <m> E _ { 0 } : L ^ { 2 } _ { P } \to L ^ { 2 } _ { P } </m> the conditional expectation with respect to <m> \mathcal { F } _ { 0 } </m> and -LRB- also by -RRB- <m> T : L ^ { 2 } _ { P } \to L ^ { 2 } _ { P } </m> the koopman operator <m> T X : = X \circ T </m> . by <m> E _ { 0 } T ^ { k } </m> we denote the composition of the operators <m> E _ { 0 } </m> and <m> T ^ { k } </m> -LRB- where , of course , <m> T ^ { k } </m> is <m> T </m> composed with itself <m> k </m> times -RRB- . the question is the following : do you know an example of a <m> \mathcal { F } _ { 0 } - </m> measurable , centered , function <m> X _ { 0 } \in L ^ { 2 } _ { P } </m> for which the series <m> \sum _ { n \geq 0 } X _ { 0 } E _ { 0 } T ^ { n } X _ { 0 } </m> converges almost surely but the series <m> \sum _ { n \geq 0 } E _ { 0 } T ^ { n } X _ { 0 } </m> diverges in a nonnegligible set ? if not , can you prove that the a.s convergence of the first series implies the a.s convergence of the second one ? -LRB- note that the reciprocal implication is trivial , and that the problem arises dealing with the set <m> [ X _ { 0 } = 0 ] </m> . -RRB-

in this arxiv paper -LRB- p. 13 -RRB- , steinhardt defines a normal set in <m> S _ n </m> as follows : definition : a split set of more than two cycles generating <m> S _ n </m> is said to be normal if any element is adjacent to at most 1 leaf , and furthermore <m> C y c ( T ) </m> is a tree . my question is on the above definition . i 'm not sure what the `` adjacent '' refers to . is this an adjacency relation in some graph , and if so , which graph ? could you illustrate this definition with some examples of normal sets <m> T </m> in <m> S _ n </m> for <m> n = 5 , 6 , 7 </m> ? let me recall from the paper the following definitions . a set of cycles <m> T </m> is said to be split if the intersection of the supports of any two elements in <m> T </m> has size at most 1 . given a split set of cycles <m> T \subset S _ n </m> , <m> C y c ( T ) </m> is defined to be the graph with vertex set <m> \{ 1 , \ldots , n \} </m> and with edges <m> ( x _ 1 , x _ 2 ) , \ldots , ( x _ { k - 1 } , x _ k ) </m> whenever <m> ( x _ 1 , \ldots , x _ k ) </m> is a cycle in <m> T </m> -LRB- here <m> x _ 1 </m> needs to be chosen arbitrarily -RRB- . the degree of <m> t \in T </m> is the number of distinct points in its support that overlap with other cycles in <m> T </m> . an element <m> t \in T </m> is a leaf it its degree is 1 .
bad reduction is defined as ` nonexistence ' of a model where the curve has good reduction . so let 's take the curve <m> C </m> which is affinely given by <m> y ^ 3 = f ( x ) </m> -LRB- absolutely irred , <m> f </m> no multiple roots -RRB- . is it clear that <m> C </m> has bad reduction at <m> p = 3 </m> ? and why ? some smart person might in the end find a model where <m> C </m> has good reduction at <m> p = 3 </m> .
is it possible to have an <m> \omega _ 2 </m> - length sequence of -LRB- <m> \omega _ 1 </m> - -RRB- suslin trees such that if one builds the product of finitely many trees in that sequence , one ends up with a suslin tree again ? the existence of such a sequence of length <m> \omega </m> follows from <m> \diamondsuit </m> , as was shown by jensen . by shelah and independently todorcevic , already a cohen real gives rise to a suslin tree , so it could be possible that a adding <m> \aleph _ 2 </m> many cohen reals produces such a sequence .
let <m> R = \mathbb { Z } [ X ^ { \pm 1 } ] </m> be the ring of laurent polynomials on one indeterminate over <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> . let <m> E _ 2 ( R ) </m> be the subgroup of <m> G L _ 2 ( R ) </m> generated by the matrices that differ from the identity by a single off-diagonal element . the question whether <m> S L _ 2 ( R ) = E _ 2 ( R ) </m> is a problem of s. bachmuth and h. y. mochizuki -LSB- 2 -RSB- . it is also an open problem in -LSB- 3 , ma1 -RSB- and a conjecture in -LSB- 4 -RSB- . i am very curious about the status of this problem/conjecture or any progress on it . a complement prompted by the first answer : p. m. cohn proved that <m> S L _ 2 ( R ) \neq E _ 2 ( R ) </m> for <m> R = \mathbb { Z } [ X ] </m> by considering the matrix <m> \begin {pmatrix} 1 + 2 X & 4 \\ - X ^ 2 & 1 - 2 X \end {pmatrix} </m> after his -LSB- lemma 8.4 , 1 -RSB- . this matrix is easily seen to sit in <m> E _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } [ X ^ { \pm 1 } ] ) </m> by cancelling one coefficient and then using whitehead 's lemma . p. m. cohn also proved using -LSB- proposition 7.2 , 1 -RSB- that the matrix <m> \begin {pmatrix} 1 + X Y & X ^ 2 \\ - Y ^ 2 & 1 - X Y \end {pmatrix} </m> does n't lie into <m> E _ 2 ( k [ X , Y ] ) </m> for any field <m> k </m> . this matrix is usually referred to as cohn 's matrix and admits the following generalization discussed by t. y. lam and t. dorsey -LSB- example vi .3.5 , 5 -RSB- : <m> C _ { m , n } ( X , Y ) = \begin {pmatrix} 1 + X Y & X ^ n Y ^ m \\ ( - 1 ) ^ r X ^ m Y ^ n & 1 - X Y + X ^ 2 Y ^ 2 - \cdots + ( - 1 ) ^ r X ^ r Y ^ r \end {pmatrix} </m> where <m> m , n \ge 0 </m> and <m> r = m + n - 1 \ge 0 </m> . the first answer 's author legitimately asks whether <m> C _ { 0 , 3 } ( X - 1 , p ) </m> lies into <m> E _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } [ X ^ { \pm 1 } ] ) </m> for <m> p </m> a prime number -LRB- it is known that <m> C _ { m , n } ( x , y ) \in E _ 3 ( R ) </m> for any elements <m> x , y </m> in a commutative ring <m> R </m> -RRB- .

-LRB- this is a re-post of 1 -RRB- in the paper `` on the realizability of singular cohomology groups '' by kan and whitehead , it is shown that there is no space <m> X </m> and integer <m> n \geq 1 </m> such that <m> H ^ { n 1 } ( X ) = 0 </m> and <m> H ^ n ( X ) = \mathbb { Q } </m> -LRB- cohomology with integral coefficients -RRB- . at the very end of the article there is a remark where it is stated that , at the time of writing -LRB- around 1960 , i suppose -RRB- , it was not known whether <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> could be a -LRB- integral -RRB- singular cohomology group at all . my question is : is this still not known ?
i imagine the dynamic of <m> S L ( 2 , \mathbb { Z } </m> -RRB- on <m> \mathbb { C } ^ 2 </m> has been studied . does one know if it is recurrent or ergodic -LRB- with respect to the lebesgue measure -RRB- ? is there any explicit description of the orbits ? thank you for your help , selim
a lie algebra <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> generates its universal enveloping algebra <m> \mathrm { U } \mathfrak { g } </m> , which has the structure of a hopf algebra . modules of <m> \mathrm { U } \mathfrak { g } </m> are exactly the of modules of <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> itself . in the case <m> \mathfrak { g } = \mathfrak { s u } _ 2 </m> , the simple modules are labeled uniquely -LRB- up to isomorphism -RRB- by their dimension , and we label them <m> V _ d </m> for <m> d = 1 , 2 , </m> etc. . note that <m> \mathrm { U } \mathfrak { s u } _ 2 </m> is itself a <m> \mathfrak { s u } _ 2 </m> module and decomposes into simple modules as <m> \bigoplus _ { j = 0 } ^ \infty V _ { 2 j + 1 } </m> , i.e. only odd-dimensional modules occur . we can consider truncations of this sum too : <m> \mathrm { U } _ J \mathfrak { s u } _ 2 \equiv \mathrm { E n d } \, V _ { 2 J + 1 } \simeq V _ { 2 J + 1 } ^ \ast \otimes V _ { 2 J + 1 } \simeq \bigoplus _ { j = 0 } ^ { 2 J } V _ { 2 j + 1 } </m> in particular , <m> \dim \mathrm { U } _ J \mathfrak { s u } _ 2 = 1 + 3 + \cdots + ( 4 J + 1 ) = ( 2 J + 1 ) ^ 2 </m> , which is <m> \dim \mathrm { E n d } \, V _ { 2 J + 1 } </m> . an explicit relationship between the basis adapted to the decomposition of <m> \mathrm { U } _ J \mathfrak { s u } _ 2 </m> given above and the basis <m> \{ E _ { i j } \} </m> -LRB- with components 1 at <m> ( i , j ) </m> and 0 elsewhere -RRB- on <m> \mathrm { E n d } \, V _ { 2 J } </m> can be given in terms of the <m> 3 j m </m> symbols . the result shows that <m> \mathrm { U } _ J \mathfrak { s u } _ 2 </m> is isomorphism to <m> \mathrm { E n d } \, V _ { 2 J + 1 } </m> as associative algebras . w. smoke 's paper invariant differential operators uses the relationship between <m> \mathrm { U } \mathfrak { s u } _ 2 </m> and differential operators on the <m> \mathrm { S U } ( 2 ) </m> group manifold . -LRB- he actually works for a generic lie algebra <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> but my focus is only on <m> \mathfrak { s u } _ 2 </m> for now . -RRB- the filtration of <m> \mathrm { U } \mathfrak { s u } _ 2 </m> is the filtration of differential operators by degree , where <m> \mathrm { U } _ J \mathfrak { s u } _ 2 </m> gives differential operators with degree at most <m> J </m> . at the top of his eighth page -LRB- p. 467 in the journal -RRB- , it is proved that <m> \mathrm { U } _ J \mathfrak { s u } _ 2 </m> is a subcoalgebra of <m> \mathrm { U } \mathfrak { s u } _ 2 </m> . my understanding is that there is no hopf algebra structure on matrix algebras like <m> \mathrm { E n d } \, V _ { 2 J + 1 } \simeq \mathrm { E n d } \, \mathbb { C } ^ { 2 J + 1 } </m> because they are simple . there is an algebra structure and a coalgebra structure , but these must not be compatible in the sense of bialgebras . but in the limit <m> J \to \infty </m> the compatibility seems to be restored , since we know <m> \mathrm { U } \mathfrak { s u } _ 2 </m> is a hopf algebra . how does this work ?
i 'm very interested in the properties of the semigroup <m> e ^ { i t \sqrt { - \Delta } } </m> , it may has some fundamental differences -LRB- such as the kernel -RRB- with the well-known schrodinger semigroup <m> e ^ { i t \Delta } </m> . any properties -LRB- or references or books -RRB- that related this semigroup are appreciated . thanks !
in this paper , the following result is proved . for any prime <m> p </m> , all the fourier coefficients of <m> \eta ( q ^ p ) ^ p / \eta ( q ) = q ^ { \frac { p ^ 2 - 1 } { 1 2 } } \prod _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty ( 1 - q ^ { p n } ) ^ p ( 1 - q ^ { n } ) ^ { - 1 } </m> are non-negative . as seeing this sequence , i conjectured all the fourier coefficients of <m> \eta ( q ^ m ) ^ m / \eta ( q ) = q ^ { \frac { m ^ 2 - 1 } { 1 2 } } \prod _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty ( 1 - q ^ { m n } ) ^ m ( 1 - q ^ { n } ) ^ { - 1 } </m> are non-negative for any positive integer <m> m </m> , . is this conjecture true ?
let <m> A </m> be a finite set of real numbers or integers . we know how to characterize , broadly speaking , sets <m> A </m> such that <m> A + A </m> is not much larger than <m> A </m> -LRB- freiman 's theorem -RRB- . i have a question that feels somewhat related but may or may not be . what are the sets <m> A </m> such that there is a bijection <m> f : A \mapsto A </m> for which <m> \left | \{ x + f ( x ) : x \in A \} \cap A \right | \geq ( 1 - \epsilon ) | A | , </m> where <m> \epsilon </m> is small ? in particular , if <m> A </m> is an interval in the integers -LRB- say , <m> A = \{ 1 , \dotsc , n \} </m> , or <m> A = \{ - n , - n + 1 , \dotsc , n \} </m> -RRB- , is there such a bijection <m> f </m> ? the related question of whether there are such <m> f </m> altogether -LRB- with <m> A </m> being initially unspecified -RRB- is easily settled . see below . the answer does imply that there are very many sets <m> A </m> for which there are such <m> f </m> , but it is unclear to me whether there is a good characterization of such sets <m> A </m> -LRB- and whether , say , <m> A </m> can be an interval in the integers -RRB- .
let <m> \Omega </m> be a sufficiently regular domain , for example <m> \Omega = B ( 0 , r ) </m> , <m> r > 0 </m> , and <m> m ( x ) = \textrm { d i s t } ( x , \partial \Omega ) </m> be the distance to boundary function . suppose <m> \mathcal { F } </m> is a given family of smooth functions , which is dense in <m> C ^ m ( \bar \Omega ) </m> -LRB- with corresponding <m> m </m> - th order sup-norms -RRB- for arbitrary <m> m </m> . is it possible to explicitly construct another family <m> \mathcal { G } </m> of functions based on <m> \mathcal { F } </m> and the function <m> m ( x ) = \textrm { d i s t } ( x , \partial \Omega ) </m> , such that <m> \mathcal { G } </m> is dense in <m> W ^ { 2 , 2 } ( \Omega ) \cap W ^ { 1 , 2 } _ 0 ( \Omega ) </m> -LRB- i.e. , any function <m> g \in \mathcal { G } </m> satisfies that <m> g | _ { \partial \Omega } = 0 </m> -RRB- ? a natural candidate is the set <m> \mathcal { G } = \{ m f \mid f \in \mathcal { F } \} , </m> where i directly multiply the function <m> f </m> by the distance function . since <m> \Omega </m> has a sufficient regular boundary , the function <m> m </m> is sufficiently smooth , hence for any <m> f \in C ^ { 2 } ( \bar { \Omega } ) </m> , <m> m f \in C ^ 2 ( \bar { \Omega } ) \cap C _ 0 ( \bar { \Omega } ) </m> . i also know <m> C ^ { 2 } ( \bar { \Omega } ) \cap C _ 0 ( \bar { \Omega } ) </m> is dense in <m> W ^ { 2 , 2 } ( \Omega ) \cap W ^ { 1 , 2 } _ 0 ( \Omega ) </m> -LRB- in <m> W ^ { 2 , 2 } </m> norm -RRB- . but i was not able to proceed further to show <m> \mathcal { G } </m> is dense in <m> C ^ 2 ( \bar { \Omega } ) \cap C _ 0 ( \bar { \Omega } ) </m> .
let <m> G = ( V , E ) </m> be a simple , undirected graph . we call it <m> k </m> - critical if <m> \chi ( G ) = k </m> and removing any vertex decreases the chromatic number . the odd circles <m> C _ { 2 n + 1 } </m> are all 3-critical . by taking any odd circle and adding a point <m> \infty </m> , connecting it to all points in the circle , we get a <m> 4 </m> - critical graph . similar constructions give rise to the following observation :
can anyone please recommend some good reading on the geometry of linear groups and their actions ? an example of the kind of question i am interested in : explicitly describe a fundamental domain for the action of <m> G L _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> on <m> G L _ 2 ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> , and compute the volume of the quotient . i 'm familiar with this particular question and its answer , but it is evidently a special case of a more general theory and i would love to see it treated in context . i looked briefly at borel 's linear algebraic groups , lang 's <m> S L _ 2 ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> , a couple intro books on lie groups -- and at a brief glance , none of them seemed to squarely address this kind of question . thank you !
-LSB- edited in response to some corrections by geoff robinson and f. ladisch -RSB- throughout , all my groups are finite , and all my representations are over the complex numbers . if <m> G </m> is a group and <m> \chi </m> is an irrreducible character on it , of degree <m> d </m> , say that <m> \chi </m> has quite large degree if <m> d \geq ( 4 / 5 ) | G | ^ { 1 / 2 } </m> . this condition has arisen in some work i am doing concerning -LRB- banach algebras built on -RRB- restricted direct products of finite groups , and while our main concern was to find some examples with this property , i am curious to know if anything more can be said . -LRB- i 've had a quick look at the papers of snyder -LRB- proc ams , 2008 -RRB- and durfee & jensen -LRB- j. alg , 2011 -RRB- , but these do n't seem to quite give what i 'm after . however , i may well have missed something in their remarks . -RRB- examples . the affine group over a finite field with <m> q </m> elements has order <m> q ( q - 1 ) </m> and a character of degree <m> q - 1 </m> , which has `` quite large degree '' for <m> q \geq 3 </m> . the affine group of the ring <m> { \mathbb Z } / p ^ n { \mathbb Z } </m> has order <m> p ^ { 2 n - 1 } ( p - 1 ) </m> and a character of degree <m> p ^ { n - 1 } ( p - 1 ) </m> , which has quite large degree for <m> p \geq 3 </m> . being fairly inexperienced in the world of finite groups , i ca n't think of other examples -LRB- except by taking finite products of some of these examples -RRB- . some simple-minded observations from a bear of little brain . a group can have at most one character of quite large degree -LRB- this is immediate from <m> | G | = \sum _ \pi d _ \pi ^ 2 </m> -RRB- . if such a character <m> \chi </m> exists , it is real -LRB- hence rational -RRB- valued -LRB- edit : as pointed out by geoff robinson in comments , <m> \chi </m> must be equal to its galois conjugates , and hence rational valued -RRB- , and its centre is trivial -LRB- consider its <m> \ell ^ 2 </m> - norm -RRB- . in particular <m> G </m> ca n't be nilpotent . moreover , since <m> \chi \phi = \chi </m> for any linear character <m> \phi </m> , a bit of thought shows that <m> \chi </m> vanishes outside the derived subgroup of <m> G </m> . now , let <m> { \mathcal C } </m> be the class of all groups <m> G </m> that possess a character of quite large degree clearly this is closed under taking finite products . let <m> { \mathcal S } </m> denote the class of all solvable groups . question 1 . does there exist a finite collection <m> { \mathcal F } </m> of groups such that every group in <m> { \mathcal C } </m> is the product of groups in <m> { \mathcal F } \cup { \mathcal S } </m> ? question 2 . can we bound the derived length of groups in <m> { \mathcal C } \cap { \mathcal S } </m> ? question 3 . if the answers to q1 and q2 are negative , or beyond current technology , would anything improve if we replaced <m> 4 / 5 </m> with <m> 1 - \epsilon </m> for one 's favourite small <m> \epsilon </m> ? question 4 . it may well be the case that hoping for a description of the class <m> { \mathcal C } </m> in terms of familiar kinds of group is far too naive and optimistic . if so , could someone please give me some indications as to why ? perhaps it reduces to a set of known open problems ?
suppose we 're selecting points uniformly at random from the <m> N </m> - simplex <m> S _ N = \{ x \in \mathbb R ^ { N + 1 } : </m> all <m> x _ i \ge 0 </m> and <m> x _ 1 + \ldots x _ N = 1 \} </m> . one way to do this in practice is choose <m> N - 1 </m> points <m> a _ 1 , \ldots , a _ { N - 1 } </m> uniformly and independently from the unit interval <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> . then for <m> a _ 0 = 0 </m> and <m> a _ 1 = 1 </m> construct the point <m> x \in S _ N </m> with each <m> x _ i = a _ i - a _ { i - 1 } </m> . one would expect for large <m> N </m> the points <m> a _ i </m> to be evenly spaced across the interval , and so the the average point looks of <m> S _ n </m> looks pretty much like the constant <m> 1 / N </m> vector . that is to say it 's unlikely for any collection of entries to be small . is anything known about the exact distribution of such collections ? formally put suppose <m> X : \Omega \to S _ N </m> is a uniformly distributed random variable from some probability space onto the <m> N </m> - simplex . define each <m> X _ k : \Omega \to [ 0 , 1 ] </m> by <m> X _ k ( x ) = </m> the <m> k </m> th largest coordinate of <m> X ( x ) </m> . i 've drawn some samples for <m> k = n / 2 </m> which is the case i 'm mostly interested in . it seems that , after you normalise the variable by multiplying by <m> N </m> , the mean tends to about <m> 0 . 7 </m> -LRB- marked with a vertical line -RRB- from above . the distributions are also increasingly tighter bell-curves . the below is with 100,000 samples per curve .
let <m> X \subset \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> be a polygon -LRB- possibly nonconvex , but not intersecting itself -RRB- with all the sides parallel to one of the axes . i am interested on whether <m> X </m> can be tiled by -LRB- finitely many -RRB- squares . for example , if all the sides of <m> X </m> have rational sides , then it can be tiled by squares . on the other hand , it is known that every rectangle that can be tiled by squares must has that its ratio of height/width is rational . my question is , what are the known obstacles for <m> X </m> to have a tiling by squares ?
let <m> p </m> be a prime and <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> denotes the <m> p </m> - adic numbers . is it true that the degree of the nontrivial <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> - irreducible representations of a cyclic group of order <m> p ^ n </m> is divisible by <m> p - 1 </m> ? proofs or references are appreciated .
let <m> X </m> be a <m> l </m> - space , i.e. a locally compact totally disconnected hausdorff space , which is not compact . then <m> P = \{ K : K \subseteq X \text { c o m p a c t - o p e n } \} </m> is a basis for the topology . regard <m> P </m> as a partial order with respect to '' <m> \subseteq </m> '' . question : which partial orders are isomorphic to partial orders which arise from <m> l </m> - spaces as above ? note that they have finite infima and suprema and a smallest element , but not a maximal element . but i doubt that this is already the whole characterization .
suppose i have a grouplike <m> A _ { \infty } </m> - space <m> G </m> that carries an additional structure as a topological group -LRB- which does not coincide with the <m> H </m> - space structure of the <m> A _ { \infty } </m> - part -RRB- . denote the <m> H </m> - space multiplication by <m> * </m> and the group multiplication by <m> \cdot </m> and suppose that <m> ( a * b ) \cdot ( c * d ) = ( a \cdot c ) * ( b \cdot d ) </m> also known as the eckmann-hilton condition holds -LRB- equality , no `` up to homotopy '' here -RRB- . moreover , the identity of the group is a homotopy unit for the <m> H </m> - space structure .
-LRB- i asked this on math.stackexchange , without response -RRB- . let <m> A </m> be a c <m> ^ * </m> - algebra , concretely acting on a hilbert space <m> H </m> . suppose that <m> \xi _ 0 \in H </m> is cyclic and separating for <m> A </m> -LRB- that is , the map <m> A \rightarrow H , a \mapsto a ( \xi _ 0 ) </m> is injective with dense range -RRB- . let <m> M = A ' ' </m> the von neumann algebra generated by <m> A </m> .
could you give a poof , comment or reference for the inequality as follows : <m> \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ n ( - 1 ) ^ k \frac { \sin k x } { k ^ { \alpha } } < 0 </m> for all <m> n = 1 , 2 , 3 , \ldots </m> and <m> 0 < x < \pi </m> and <m> \alpha \ge 1 </m>

i got a little bit confused about the definition of geodesic for <m> \rm S O ( 3 ) </m> as
we define an equivalence relation on <m> \mathcal { P } ( \omega ) </m> : for <m> x , y \in \mathcal { P } ( \omega ) </m> we say <m> x \simeq _ { f i n } y \text { i f f t h e r e i s } n \in \omega \text { s u c h t h a t } x \setminus \{ 0 , \ldots , n \} = y \setminus \{ 0 , \ldots , n \} . </m> the set <m> \mathcal { P } ( \omega ) / \simeq _ { f i n } </m> is usually written as <m> \mathcal { P } ( \omega ) / f i n </m> . for <m> [ x ] , [ y ] \in \mathcal { P } ( \omega ) / f i n </m> we say <m> [ x ] \leq [ y ] </m> iff there is <m> n \in \omega </m> such that <m> ( x \setminus \{ 0 , \ldots , n \} ) \subseteq ( y \setminus \{ 0 , \ldots , n \} ) </m> . it is a routine verification that this relation is well-defined . does <m> \mathcal { P } ( \omega ) / f i n </m> contain an anti-chain of cardinality <m> 2 ^ { \aleph _ 0 } </m> ?
if <m> \zeta ( s ) </m> is the riemann zeta function , then <m> \zeta ( n ) ^ z </m> , with <m> z \in \mathbb { C } </m> , <m> \Re ( s ) > 1 </m> , can be represented as <m> \zeta ( s ) ^ z = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { d _ z ( n ) } { n ^ { - s } } </m> where <m> d _ z ( n ) </m> can be represented as <m> d _ z ( n ) = \prod _ { p ^ a \mid n } ( - 1 ) ^ a \binom { - z } { a } </m> -LRB- see pg . 421 of ivic 's `` the riemann-function : theory and practice '' -RRB- . there are a few more representations of <m> d _ z ( n ) </m> in chapter 2 of bateman and diamond 's `` analytic number theory : an introductory course '' as well . my question : can this be generalized for the hurwitz zeta function <m> \zeta ( s , q ) = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { 1 } { ( q + n ) ^ s } </m> with the added restriction that <m> q \in \mathbb { N } </m> ? which is to say , is there some <m> f _ { q , z } ( n ) </m> that satisfies <m> \zeta ( s , q ) ^ z = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { f _ { q , z } ( n ) } { n ^ { - s } } </m> ? and if so , how can it be expressed ? it 's trivial to see that <m> f _ { q , 1 } ( n ) = 1 </m> if <m> n > = q </m> and 0 otherwise for <m> \zeta ( n , q ) </m> . it 's not much more difficult to see that <m> f _ { q , k } ( n ) = \sum _ { a \cdot b = n } f _ { q , 1 } ( a ) \cdot f _ { q , k - 1 } ( b ) </m> for <m> \zeta ( n , q ) ^ k </m> , with <m> k \in \mathbb { N } </m> , through the standard mechanics of dirichlet convolution . but i 'm stumped for the more general case of <m> z \in \mathbb { C } </m> , despite my firm conviction that the hurwitz zeta function can indeed be raised to complex powers .
let <m> C </m> be category , let <m> P S h ( C ) = [ C ^ { o p } , </m> * set * <m> ] </m> be the category of presheaves on <m> C </m> , the karoubi envelope of <m> C </m> , denoted <m> \overline { C } </m> , is defined as the full subcategory of <m> P S h ( C ) </m> which are retracts of objects in <m> C </m> under the yoneda embedding . i 'm reading this paper on karoubi envelopes -LRB- `` cauchy completion in category theory '' by borceux and dejean -RRB- , on page 3 -LRB- theorem 1 -RRB- they say : '' -LRB- 4 -RRB- the category <m> P S h ( \overline { C } ) </m> of presheaves on <m> \overline { C } </m> is equivalent to the category <m> P S h ( C ) </m> of presheaves on <m> C </m> '' i 'm interested to see how they proved this equivalence so i 've been trying to follow the whole proof to get to where they prove it but frankly i 'm stuck and a lot of what they 're saying is going over my head , like for example this : `` if every idempotent of <m> C </m> splits , every retract of a representable functor <m> C ( - , c ) </m> induces an idempotent on <m> C ( - , c ) </m> , thus an idempotent <m> e </m> on <m> C </m> , <m> e </m> splits in <m> C </m> , which produces a retraction of <m> c </m> and thus a retraction of <m> C ( - , c ) </m> , which ... '' that 's where i first got lost , every retract of a representable functor induces an idempotent on itself thus an idempotent <m> e </m> on <m> C </m> that splits ?? do n't follow at all , i tried to skip to the next paragraph -LRB- where they prove the equivalence -RRB- , it says : `` to prove -LRB- 4 -RRB- , it suffices to show that every presheaf <m> F </m> on <m> C </m> can be uniquely -LRB- up to an isomorphism -RRB- extended in a presheaf <m> \overline { F } </m> on <m> \overline { C } </m> . '' -LRB- `` extended in a presheaf <m> \overline { F } </m> '' ? i guess they mean `` extended to a presheaf <m> \overline { F } </m> '' right ? -RRB- , then they write : `` from the uniqueness of the splitting in <m> \overline { C } </m> of an idempotent <m> e \in C </m> and the cauchy completeness of the category of sets -LRB- proposition 1 -RRB- , <m> \overline { F } </m> has to map the splitting of <m> e </m> on the splitting of <m> F e </m> . '' -LRB- do n't they mean <m> \overline { F } </m> has to map the splitting of <m> e </m> to the splitting of <m> F ( e ) </m> ? what do they mean by on ? -RRB- the proof is longer but i just about stopped there , could n't follow the rest of the proof , can anyone provide some clarification on this ? please be nice to me :-RRB-
the 2-sphere , endowed with the round riemann metric with constant curvature 1 , is a symplectic manifolds . my question is : is the group of symplectic automorphisms of <m> S ^ 2 </m> with respect to this symplectic structure connected ? my motivation to this question is as follows . if the answer to this question is yes , then any symplectic automorphism of <m> S ^ 2 </m> can be connected by a path with the identity map . then the study of the automorphism can be reduced to the studty of a family of smooth functions . and then we are possibly allowed to enter the area of complex analysis since smooth funtions on <m> S ^ 2 </m> can be approximated by holomoprhic functions on some complex manifold containg <m> S ^ 2 </m> as a totally real submanifold . the above question can be asked for compact hermitian symmetric spaces , or more generally for coadjoint orbits of semi-simple lie groups . so could you recommand any references about the topological structure of symplectic automorphisms of these spaces ? symplectic geometry is not my major . thanks a lot for your help !
there are many proposed models for the theory of <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - categories and it has now been shown that many of these theories have quillen-equivalent model categories , i.e. that they are equivalent as homotopy theories . but what about as category theories ? for example , suppose i have a homotopical category <m> \mathcal { C } </m> and a homotopically initial object <m> A </m> in <m> \mathcal { C } </m> , in the sense of -LSB- dwyer , kan , hirschhorn , and smith , homotopy limit functors on model categories and homotopical categories -RSB- . that means , there are endofunctors <m> F </m> and <m> G </m> on <m> \mathcal { C } </m> such that <m> \Delta A </m> is weakly equivalent to <m> F </m> , <m> G </m> is weakly equivalent to <m> \textrm { i d } _ { \mathcal { C } } </m> , and there is a natural transformation <m> \alpha : F \Rightarrow G </m> such that <m> \alpha _ A : F A \to G A </m> is a weak equivalence . it is straightforward to show that <m> A </m> descends to an initial object in <m> \operatorname { H o } \mathcal { C } </m> , but what about in , say , the hammock localisation <m> L ^ H \mathcal { C } </m> -- is the hom-space <m> L ^ H \mathcal { C } ( A , Z ) </m> contractible for every object <m> Z </m> in <m> \mathcal { C } </m> ? more generally , how are the notions of homotopy limit/colimit , adjunction , kan extension etc. in the different theories -LRB- where defined -RRB- related ? pointers to relevant literature would be much appreciated .
let <m> F : C \to D </m> be a functor of small categories . one can form the comma categories <m> F / </m> and <m> / F </m> with objects <m>  </m> where <m> c \in O b ( C ) </m> , <m> d \in O b ( D ) </m> , and <m> \phi , \psi \in A r r ( D ) </m> . can these categories be expressed as a limit or colimit in <m> \textbf { C a t } </m> ?
take <m> \Bbbk </m> to be a field , <m> q \in \Bbbk </m> a nonroot of unity , and <m> U = U _ q ( \mathfrak g ) </m> the quantized enveloping algebra of a complex finite dimensional simple lie algebra , and write <m> U ^ - </m> for its negative part . short version : can you get a global basis of <m> U ^ - </m> in the sense of kashiwara and lusztig in these conditions -LRB- i.e. not just <m> q </m> transcendental over <m> q </m> -RRB- , say by specialization , or do you lose some of the nice properties that make this basis a distinguished one ? long version : kashiwara and lusztig discovered a very nice basis for <m> U ^ - </m> , called the global basis , but in order to show it exists they need <m> \Bbbk </m> to be of characteristic <m> 0 </m> and <m> q </m> transcendental over <m> \mathbb Q </m> . on the other hand , they prove that this basis is in fact a basis of a suitable <m> \mathcal A = \mathbb Z [ v , v ^ { - 1 } ] </m> - form of <m> U ^ - </m> , denoted by <m> U ^ - _ \mathcal A </m> . so letting <m> v </m> act as multiplication by <m> q </m> on <m> \Bbbk </m> we get a map <m> U ^ - \to \Bbbk \otimes _ { \mathcal A } U ^ - _ { \mathcal A } </m> that is -LRB- a -RRB- surjective and -LRB- b -RRB- compatible with the weight decomposition of <m> U ^ - </m> , hence an isomorphism -LRB- this is the part that breaks down if <m> q </m> is a root of unity -RRB- . so if i got this correctly , the global basis in fact survives in the case where <m> \Bbbk </m> is any old field containing a nonroot of unity <m> q </m> . now the global basis has some other nice properties related to highest weight representations of <m> U </m> . in that case , i am less sure but i think similar -LRB- rather roundabout -RRB- arguments apply to show that they also survive from the <m> \mathbb Q ( v ) </m> - context to the <m> \Bbbk </m> context , but maybe i am missing some obvious reason for which things break down quickly in the second case . i have searched the literature for references for global bases for <m> q </m> nonroot of unity but could not find any . is this simply because no one has found a need for them , or is it because they are not useful in this context ?
let <m> Q \subset \mathbb { P } ^ 4 </m> be a smooth three-dimensional quadric over an algebraically closed field <m> k </m> -LRB- <m> \mathrm { c h a r } ( k ) \neq 2 </m> -RRB- and let <m> F </m> be the fano variety of lines on <m> Q </m> . in `` iskovskikh v. a. , prokhorov yu . g. - fano varieties '' at page 29 it is stated that <m> F </m> is isomorphic to <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 3 </m> .
given a countable coloring of the plane , is it always possible to find a monochromatic set of points <m> \left \{ \left ( x , y \right ) , \left ( x + w , y \right ) , \left ( x , y + h \right ) , \left ( x + w , y + h \right ) \right \} </m> -LRB- the corners of a rectangle -RRB- ?
before posting this question , i just asked a similar question : a question about connected open sets in <m> R ^ 2 </m> . i got several nice answers.now i want to ask : let <m> U </m> be a nonempty connected open set in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> and <m> U \not = \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> . i want to ask if there must exist an open ball <m> B \subset \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> such that <m> B \not \subset U </m> and <m> B \cap U </m> is a nonempty connected open set .
as from the title , i am currently dealing with this sum <m> \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ \infty \frac { 1 } { ( a + n ^ 2 ) ^ p } </m> in particular with <m> p = 1 / 2 , 3 / 2 , . . . </m> -LRB- but once solved for <m> p = 1 / 2 </m> one can derive wrt <m> a </m> and find the others -RRB- , and real positive <m> a </m> . i would like to understand which kind of zeta function is it -LRB- shintani 's zeta ?? -RRB- and how to regularise it -LRB- mathematica tells me it does not converge -RRB- . any good reference dealing with this kind of sums ?
it is well known <m> \newcommand { \Diff } { \operatorname { D i f f } } </m> that the group <m> \Diff ( S ^ 1 ) </m> of smooth diffeomorphisms of the circle behaves in many ways like <m> S L ( 2 , \mathbb R ) </m> . for example , if <m> S ^ 1 \subseteq \Diff ( S ^ 1 ) </m> is the group of rotations then <m> \Diff ( S ^ 1 ) / S ^ 1 </m> is an infinite dimensional complex domain -LRB- apparently this is due to kirillov and yuriev -RRB- . this is analogous to the symmetric space <m> S L ( 2 , \mathbb R ) / S ^ 1 </m> which is the complex upper half plane . now <m> S L ( 2 , \mathbb R ) </m> has some very useful decompositions : the iwasawa decomposition -LRB- or the <m> K A N </m> decomposition -RRB- and the <m> K A K </m> decomposition . does <m> \Diff ( S ^ 1 ) </m> also have <m> K A N </m> and <m> K A K </m> decompositions ?
the space <m> C ^ { \infty } ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) </m> can be turned into a topological ring using the whitney topology . whitney 's spectral theorem says that the closure of an ideal in this ring is the ideal of all functions whose taylor expansion up to order <m> r \in \mathbb { N } </m> at any point equals the taylor expansion up to order <m> r </m> of some function in the ideal . i 'm interested in a characterization of the closed ideals of this ring . by neil strickland 's answer here -- ideals of the ring of smooth functions , using whitney 's spectral theorem , one may describe the closed ideals in <m> C ^ { \infty } ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> as having the form <m> \{ f : f ^ { ( i ) } = 0 \, \, \text { o n } \, \, X \, \, \text { f o r a l l } \, \, i \leq n \} </m> for some closed set <m> X \subset \mathbb { R } </m> . this is probably very simple , but could someone quickly explain in more detail how whitney 's spectral theorem implies this result ? more generally , i 'm interested in whether or not the question martin brandenburg hinted at in the comment section of that post is true -- do the closed ideals arise as intersections of sets of the following form <m> \{ f : f ( p ) = 0 \, \, \text { a n d } \, \, \forall \, \, i \leq \alpha _ i , \, j \leq n , \, \, ( \partial _ 1 ^ { \alpha _ 1 } \dots \partial _ j ^ i ) f ( p ) = 0 \} </m> for some <m> p \in \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> and some multi-index <m> \alpha = ( \alpha _ 1 , \dots , \alpha _ n ) </m> ?
what is known about the order of <m> \zeta ( 1 + i t ) </m> ? iwaniec-kowalski gives -LRB- pp. 226 citing a result of vinogradov-korobov -RRB- <m> | \zeta ( 1 + i t ) | \lesssim ( \log t ) ^ { 2 / 3 } , </m> and oppositely titchmarsh gives -LRB- pp. 188 citing bohr-landau -RRB- <m> | \zeta ( 1 + i t ) | \gtrsim \log \log t </m> for infinitely many values of <m> t </m> . is this the limit of our knowledge ? is it conditionally known -LRB- or even expected -RRB- unconditionally known that <m> | \zeta ( 1 + i t ) | = e ^ { o ( \log \log t ) } </m> ? -LSB- as david points out below , on rh the result in titchmarsh 's book is optimal . -RSB-
i define the notion of `` galois class of l functions '' in the following way : <m> A </m> is a galois class of l functions if and only if the follwing three conditions hold simultaneously : 1 -RRB- every element of <m> A </m> belongs to the selberg class and factors in a unique fashion in a product of primitive functions of this class 2 -RRB- the constant map equal to <m> 1 </m> belongs to <m> A </m> 3 -RRB- whenever <m> F </m> and <m> G </m> are in <m> A </m> , then so is <m> F . G </m> . then i define the group <m> A u t ( A ) </m> of the automorphisms of a galois class of l functions <m> A </m> as the group of bijections <m> \phi </m> from <m> A </m> to itself such that the following conditions simultaneously hold : 1 -RRB- for all <m> F </m> in <m> A </m> , <m> d _ { \phi ( F ) } = d _ { F } </m> where <m> d _ { F } </m> is the degree of <m> F </m> 2 -RRB- <m> \phi </m> maps any primitive function of <m> A </m> to a primitive function of <m> A </m> 3 -RRB- for all <m> F </m> , <m> G </m> in <m> A </m> , <m> \phi ( F . G ) = \phi ( F ) \phi ( G ) </m> . now let <m> M </m> be the maximal galois class of l functions , <m> F </m> a primitive element of <m> M </m> . i denote by <m> < F > </m> the galois class of l functions generated by <m> F </m> , of the form <m> \{ F ^ { n } , n \in \mathbb { N } \} </m> . i also define the `` structure group '' of <m> < F > </m> , denoted as <m> S t r ( < F > ) </m> , as the group of automorphisms of <m> M </m> preserving <m> F </m> . is it true that there exists <m> \ell \in \mathbb { P } \cup \{ \infty \} </m> such that <m> S t r ( < F > ) </m> is isomorphic to -LRB- a subgroup of -RRB- the absolute galois group of <m> \mathbb { Q } _ { \ell } </m> ? thanks in advance . edit : the desired subgroup of <m> G a l ( \overline { \mathbb { Q } _ { \ell } } / \mathbb { Q } _ { \ell } ) </m> might be of index <m> 1 </m> or <m> 2 </m> depending on whether <m> F </m> is self-dual or not .

my question is rather vague and i apologize . let <m> X </m> be a smooth quasi-projective variety over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> . i am interested in whether there are homological properties which distinguish algebraic vector fields which generate a <m> \mathbb { C } ^ * </m> action from an arbitrary algebraic vector field <m> Z </m> .
let <m> A </m> be a simple <m> C ^ { * } </m> algebra . assume that the space of projections has a connected component homeomorphic to the complex grassmanian <m> G ( k , n ) </m> . is it true to say that , for all <m> k ' < k </m> , the space of projections has a connected component homeomorphic to <m> G ( k ' , n ) </m> ?
let <m> G </m> be a graph of maximum degree <m> d </m> . are there any known/easy bounds on the clique number of <m> G ^ k </m> , in terms of <m> d </m> and <m> k </m> ? i would like something at least epsilon better than the bound on the degree of <m> G ^ k </m> -LRB- something like half of this bound would be very nice , and not surprising -RRB- , and am particularly interested in the case <m> d = 4 </m> and <m> k = 4 </m> . edit : apparently this is well-studied , and called the degree-diameter problem . so here is a twist : what if some vertex is in at least two triangles ?
the statement i am concerned with is this : let <m> \varphi : \mathbb { P } ^ r _ { \mathbb { Z } _ p } \to \mathbb { P } ^ r _ { \mathbb { Z } _ p } </m> be a morphism of degree higher than one . then the set of <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> - rational periodic points for <m> \varphi </m> is finite . the assumption that <m> \varphi </m> is a morphism over <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> -LRB- and not just over <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> -RRB- means that we deal with an iteration having a good reduction . an example showing the necessity of such an assumption is <m> r = 1 </m> and <m> \varphi _ { \mathbb { Q } _ p } ( z ) = ( z ^ p - z ) / p </m> : all the periodic points in this example lie in <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p \cup \{ \infty \} </m> . -LRB- of course , the example has no model over <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> . -RRB- i am aware of the following results in the literature :
in lurie 's `` a survey of elliptic cohomology '' , he writes on page 14 that if <m> A </m> is an ordinary commutative ring considered as an <m> E _ \infty </m> - ring , then <m> A </m> - module spectra are the same thing as objects of the derived category of <m> A </m> - modules . this is mysterious to me . on the one hand , to an <m> A </m> - module spectrum <m> M </m> we might associate the <m> A </m> - modules <m> \pi _ n ( M ) </m> , but i do n't know of any interesting maps between these ; perhaps this will just end up being the homology of any representative chain complex of <m> A </m> - modules . but then , i certainly do n't see a natural way of getting from an object of <m> \mathcal { D } ( \mbox { M o d } _ A ) </m> to an <m> A </m> - module spectrum . incidentally , what does this induce on the level of categories ? the obvious first guess is that <m> A </m> - module spectra actually form a topological category and that passing to <m> \mathcal { D } ( \mbox { M o d } _ A ) </m> applies <m> \pi _ 0 </m> .
the syz conjecture roughly says that any calabi-yau threefold <m> X </m> has a special lagrnagian fibration <m> \pi : X \rightarrow B </m> by 3-tous with section and one of its mirror partners <m> \check { X } </m> is obtained by dualizing each smooth fiber . i often come across a statement claiming that the base <m> B </m> is expected to be a 3-sphere <m> S ^ 3 </m> . if i remember correctly , one of explanation is given by homological mirror symmetry conjecture . could anyone give me a reference for this or kindly explain why this is true ? i am a math graduate student with some background in some algebraic and symplectic geometry . thank you .

let <m> ( X , \tau ) </m> be a topological space . with <m> T _ 2 ( \tau ) </m> we denote the collection of <m> T _ 2 </m> - topologies on <m> X </m> that contain <m> \tau </m> . is there an example of a topology <m> \tau </m> such that the partially ordered set <m> ( T _ 2 ( \tau ) , \subseteq ) </m> contains no minimal members ?
in the multivariable <m> S L _ 2 </m> - orbit theorem -LRB- which describes the asymptotic behavior of the period map associated to a polarized <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> - vhs , can we choose a suitable base point such that the representation of <m> \mathbf { S L } _ 2 ( \mathbb { C } ) ^ r </m> is defined over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> ? the answer for case of <m> r = 1 </m> is yes and it was proved by schmid in his famous 1973 's paper .

it is known that if <m> R </m> is a dvr with fraction field <m> K , </m> then the <m> R </m> - submodules of <m> K </m> are <m> 0 , K , x ^ n R , </m> with <m> n </m> any integer and <m> x </m> a generator of the maximal ideal of <m> R . </m> i was wondering if there is a simple structure theorem for the <m> R </m> - submodules of <m> K ^ n , </m> the <m> n </m> - dimensional vector space over <m> K </m> -LRB- similar to that for finitely generated torsion-free modules over a dedekind domain -RRB- . i know that the subroups of <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> are somewhat complicated to describe , but was wondering , in particular , if the situation gets any nicer with , say , <m> \mathbb { Z } _ P </m> - submodules of <m> \mathbb { Q } ^ n , </m> where <m> P </m> is a nonzero prime ideal of <m> \mathbb { Z } . </m>

let <m> C </m> be a quartic plane curve . suppose that for a given coordinate system <m> C = ( F _ 4 ( x _ 0 , x _ 1 , x _ 2 ) = 0 ) </m> where there the polynomial <m> F _ 4 </m> factorizes as <m> F _ 4 ( x _ 0 , x _ 1 , x _ 2 ) = F _ 3 ( x _ 0 , x _ 1 , x _ 2 ) F _ 1 ( x _ 0 , x _ 1 , x _ 2 ) - F _ 2 ( x _ 0 , x _ 1 , x _ 2 ) ^ 2 </m> if the coordinate system is fixed . how many factorization are there ? more generally , let <m> H i l b _ d \cong \mathbb { P } ^ { N d } </m> be the hilbert scheme of curves of degree <m> d </m> in <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 2 </m> . we can define the map <m> H i l b _ 3 \times H i l b _ 1 \times H i l b _ 2 \to H i l b _ 4 </m> as <m> \{ F _ 3 ( x _ 0 , x _ 1 , x _ 2 ) , F _ 2 ( x _ 0 , x _ 1 , x _ 2 ) , F _ 1 ( x _ 0 , x _ 1 , x _ 2 ) \} \to F _ 3 F _ 1 - F _ 2 ^ 2 </m> what can i say about the fibers of the map ? i noticed that if <m> F _ 1 ( x _ 0 , x _ 1 , x _ 2 ) </m> is a bitangent of the curve <m> C </m> , then i can start playing around ... however , this seems to be an elementary question , and maybe i am missing something obvious .
given a finite family <m> A : = ( A _ j ) _ { j \in J } </m> of operators <m> A _ j \in \mathcal { L } ( H ) </m> ,
let <m> X </m> be a set , and <m> \cal F </m> a family of subsets of <m> X </m> , let <m> \Sigma ( \cal F ) </m> denote the smallest <m> \sigma </m> - algebra containing <m> \cal F </m> . we can also define <m> \Sigma ( \cal F ) </m> internally using a transfinite induction up to <m> \omega _ 1 </m> . we will say that <m> \cal F </m> is a generating family of <m> \Sigma ( \cal F ) </m> . for a <m> \sigma </m> - algebra <m> \cal B </m> , let <m> \frak g ( \cal B ) = \min \lbrace | \cal F | : \Sigma ( \cal F ) = B \rbrace </m> . of course this may depend on the space <m> X </m> , so let us assume that always <m> X \in \cal B </m> , which then can be recovered as <m> X = \bigcup \cal B </m> . it is not hard to see that the <m> \cal B ( \Bbb R ) </m> , the borel <m> \sigma </m> - algebra of <m> \mathbb R </m> , has a countable generating family , namely open intervals of the form <m> ( p , q ) </m> where <m> p , q \in \mathbb Q </m> . that is <m> { \frak g ( \cal B ( \Bbb R ) ) } = \aleph _ 0 </m> .
so from the <m> \overline { \partial } </m> - poincare lemma , there is a short exact sequence of sheaves on <m> X = \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> <m> 0 \to \Omega \to A ^ { 1 , 0 } \to Z ^ { 1 , 1 } \to 0 </m> where <m> \Omega </m> is the sheaf of holomophic 1-forms , <m> A ^ { 1 , 0 } </m> is the sheaf of -LRB- 1,0 -RRB- - forms , <m> Z ^ { 1 , 1 } </m> is sheaf of closed -LRB- 1,1 -RRB- - forms and the surjection is apply <m> \overline { \partial } </m> . the higher cohomology of <m> A ^ { 1 , 0 } </m> vanishes which gives an isomorphism : <m> H ^ 1 ( X , \Omega ) \cong \frac { \Gamma ( Z ^ { 1 , 1 } ) } { \overline { \partial } \Gamma ( A ^ { 1 , 0 } ) } = : H _ { \overline { \partial } } ^ { 1 , 1 } ( X ) </m> both groups are isomorphic to <m> \mathbb { C } </m> . the first group can be described explicitly via cech cohomology and the standard cover of <m> X </m> ; in suitable coordinates a generator is <m> \dfrac { d z } { z } </m> . what is the image of <m> \dfrac { d z } { z } </m> in <m> H _ { \overline { \partial } } ^ { 1 , 1 } ( X ) </m> ? more specifically , can you write down a global closed -LRB- 1,1 -RRB- form that represents the class of <m> \dfrac { d z } { z } </m> ? i know that being able to avoid descriptions such as these is one of the great virtues of cech cohomology , but i guess some stubborn part of me would like to see the dolbeault description .
the well know mumford-shah functional functional <m> F ( u ) = \int _ \Omega | \nabla u | ^ 2 + \mathcal H ^ { N - 1 } ( S _ u ) \tag 1 </m> where <m> u \in S B V ( \Omega ) </m> and <m> \nabla u </m> is the absolutely continuous part of distribution derivative <m> D u </m> and <m> S _ u </m> is the jump set of <m> u </m> . the functional in <m> ( 1 ) </m> can be approximated by sobolev function via gamma convergence sense by following functional <m> F _ \epsilon ( u , v ) : = \int _ \Omega \left [ v ^ 2 | { \nabla u } | ^ 2 \right ] d x + \int _ { \Omega } \left [ \epsilon | { \nabla v } | ^ 2 + \frac { 1 } { 4 \epsilon } { ( v - 1 ) ^ 2 } \right ] d x \tag 2 </m> the original proof is really long . my question : given that <m> u \in S B V \cap L ^ \infty </m> , can we interchange the energy part in <m> ( 1 ) </m> and <m> ( 2 ) </m> from <m> | \nabla u | ^ 2 </m> to <m> | \nabla u | </m> ? i.e. , form superlinear to linear growth ? i.e. , if i define <m> E ( u ) = \int _ \Omega | \nabla u | + \mathcal H ^ { N - 1 } ( S _ u ) \tag 3 </m> <m> E _ \epsilon ( u , v ) : = \int _ \Omega \left [ v | { \nabla u } | \right ] d x + \int _ { \Omega } \left [ \epsilon | { \nabla v } | ^ 2 + \frac { 1 } { 4 \epsilon } { ( v - 1 ) ^ 2 } \right ] d x \tag 4 </m> may i have <m> E _ \epsilon </m> gamma convergence to <m> E </m> ? i understand there is a difference between super-linear growth and linear growth , but for my opinion that <m> | \nabla u | </m> is more suitable in term of <m> S B V </m> norm . thank you !
for a commutative ring <m> S </m> of finite krull dimension <m> d </m> , we have <m> 1 + d \leq \dim ( S [ X ] ) \leq 2 d + 1 </m> . one proof of this uses the fact that if <m> Q _ 1 \subset Q _ 2 \subset Q _ 3 </m> is a chain of prime ideals of <m> S [ X ] </m> , then <m> Q _ 1 \cap S \subset Q _ 3 \cap S </m> . now let <m> R </m> be a commutative ring of infinite dimension . let <m> \mathcal { C } </m> be a chain of prime ideals in <m> R [ X ] </m> of arbitrary cardinality . consider <m> \mathcal { C _ R } = \{ Q \cap R : Q \in \mathcal { C } \} </m> , a chain of prime ideals in <m> R </m> . it follows from the fact in the previous paragraph that <m> \mathcal { C _ R } </m> is countably infinite if and only if <m> \mathcal { C } </m> is countably infinite . is it true in general that <m> \mathcal { C } </m> and <m> \mathcal { C _ R } </m> have the same cardinality ?
is there a solution for equation <m> \arcsin ( ( 1 - x ) ^ { 1 / 2 } ) = \arccos ( x ^ { 1 / 2 } ) </m> in which <m> x </m> is rational number without using <m> \sin </m> and <m> \cos </m> functions in which ?
let <m> ( X , \Sigma ) </m> denote a measurable space . is there a non-trivial <m> \sigma </m> - algebra <m> \Sigma ^ 1 </m> of subsets of <m> \Sigma </m> so that <m> ( \Sigma , \Sigma ^ 1 ) </m> is also a measurable space ?
i have a question that it seems simple but i can not solve it . let <m> \Omega </m> be the unit ball centered at zero in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ N </m> , <m> N > 4 </m> . assume that <m> C _ { 0 , r a d } ^ { \infty } ( \Omega ) </m> is the space of all radial symmetric smooth functions with compact support .
the name pretty much says it all : there 's a well-defined operation on categories equivalent to modules over some ring : if <m> \mathcal { C } _ 1 = A \operatorname { - m o d } </m> and <m> \mathcal { C } _ 2 = B \operatorname { - m o d } </m> , then <m> \mathcal { C } _ 1 \boxtimes \mathcal { C } _ 2 = A \otimes B \operatorname { - m o d } </m> is independent of the choice of <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> -LRB- since morita equivalence of one of the factors will induce morita equivalence of the tensor product -RRB- .
let <m> i : D \hookrightarrow X </m> and <m> f : X \to Y </m> be holomorphic mappings of complex manifolds such that <m> i </m> is a closed embedding and <m> f </m> as well as <m> f \circ i </m> are proper and smooth and <m> D </m> is a divisor . then a holomorphic family <m> ( X _ y , D _ y ) </m> are the fibers <m> X _ y = f ^ { - 1 } ( y ) </m> and <m> D _ y = ( f \circ i ) ^ { - 1 } ( y ) </m> . first question :
letting <m> \mathrm { C a t } </m> denote the category of -LRB- small -RRB- categories and <m> \mathrm { S e t } _ \Delta </m> the category of simplicial sets , it is well known that the nerve <m> N : \mathrm { C a t } \to \mathrm { S e t } _ \Delta </m> admits a left adjoint which we can denote by <m> \mathrm { H o } : \mathrm { S e t } _ \Delta \to \mathrm { C a t } </m> . endowing <m> \mathrm { C a t } </m> with the unique -LRB- proper -RRB- model structure <m> [ 1 ] </m> having as weak equivalences the usual equivalences of categories and <m> \mathrm { S e t } _ \Delta </m> with the joyal model structure one can readily check that <m> ( \mathrm { H o } , N ) </m> is a quillen pair . by work of aaron mazel-gee <m> [ 2 ] </m> this induces an adjunction <m> i : \mathcal { C } \mathrm { a t } \leftrightarrows \mathcal { C } \mathrm { a t } _ \infty : \mathrm { H o } , </m> between the <m> \infty </m> - categories underlying , respectively , the model categories <m> \mathrm { C a t } </m> and <m> \mathrm { S e t } _ \Delta </m> above . we can therefore conclude that <m> i : \mathcal { C } \mathrm { a t } \to \mathcal { C } \mathrm { a t } _ \infty </m> preserves limits -LRB- 5.2.3.5 higher topos theory -RRB- . however , i do not believe that <m> i </m> preserves colimits . my argument goes as follows : one can also present <m> \mathcal { C } \mathrm { a t } _ \infty </m> as the <m> \infty </m> - category underlying the cartesian model structure on <m> \mathrm { S e t } _ \Delta ^ + </m> , the category of marked simplical sets . as this is combinatorial -LRB- 3.1.3.7 htt -RRB- and simplicial -LRB- 3.1.4.4 htt -RRB- <m> \mathcal { C } \mathrm { a t } _ \infty </m> is presentable -LRB- a. 3.7.6 htt -RRB- . similarly , in a note by rezk <m> [ 3 ] </m> it is shown that canonical model structure on <m> \mathrm { C a t } </m> is cofibrantly generated and simplicial . i assume that <m> \mathrm { C a t } </m> is locally presentable , though i do not know of a reference . assuming that this is the case , <m> \mathcal { C } \mathrm { a t } </m> is also presentable . by the adjoint functor theorem -LRB- 5.5.2.9 htt -RRB- <m> i </m> preserves colimits if and only if <m> i </m> admits a right adjoint . let 's denote such a candidate right adjoint by <m> R : \mathcal { C } \mathrm { a t } _ \infty \to \mathcal { C } \mathrm { a t } </m> . then in particular it must be that case that for each ordinary category <m> \mathrm { C } </m> and each <m> \infty </m> - category <m> \mathcal { C } </m> , <m> \mathrm { M a p } ( \mathrm { C } , \mathcal { C } ) \simeq \mathrm { M a p } ( \mathrm { C } , R ( \mathcal { C } ) . </m> consider the case when <m> \mathrm { C } = [ 0 ] </m> and <m> \mathcal { C } </m> is an <m> \infty </m> - groupoid <m> X </m> . then the above adjunction would require an equivalence of spaces <m> X \simeq \iota R ( X ) . </m> since <m> R ( X ) </m> is an ordinary category , <m> \iota R ( X ) </m> is <m> 1 </m> - truncated and so such an equivalence can not hold for general <m> X </m> .
let <m> \psi ( x ) = \sum _ { n \leq x } \Lambda ( n ) </m> be the weighted prime counting function . i am trying to evaluate the integral <m> \kappa : = \int _ { 1 } ^ { \infty } \frac { \psi ( x ) - x } { x ^ { 2 } } d x </m> in several different ways . originally , this integral came up as a particular part in a particular case for a a formula for a summatory function i was looking at . from now on , let <m> \gamma </m> refer to the euler-mascheroni constant . -LRB- now corrected :-RRB- i found a fun , elementary approach to this integral which gave <m> \kappa = - 1 - \gamma </m> if we assume the quantitative prime number theorem . -LRB- precisely , we just need to assume that this integral is absolutely convergent . -RRB- since i am not too confident about this , i naturally wanted to check by complex analytic methods to see if my answer was correct . my question then is :
let <m> ( X _ n ) </m> be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables uniformly distributed in <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> ; and , for <m> n \geq 1 </m> , set <m> S _ n = \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ n \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { X _ k } } \, . </m> it follows from the generalized central limit theorem -LRB- as in -LSB- 1 -RSB- and -LSB- 2 , theorem 3.1 -RSB- -RRB- that <m> \frac { S _ n - 2 n } { \sqrt { n \ln n } } </m> converges in law to a gaussian distribution . however , in this case berry -- esseen fails to give any convergence rate , as the summands are not square integrable . moreover , hall 's results for this sort of sum do not apply . -LRB- in -LSB- 3 -RSB- , this would correspond to <m> \alpha = 2 </m> , while the results hold for <m> 0 < \alpha < 2 </m> . -RRB-

is it consistent with <m> \mathsf { Z F } </m> -LRB- without <m> \mathsf { A C } </m> -RRB- that there is an infinite set <m> X </m> and a subset <m> S \subseteq \mathcal P ( X ) </m> of the same cardinality as <m> \mathcal P ( X ) </m> with the property that whenever <m> s \neq t \in S </m> we have <m> | s \cap t | \leq 1 </m> ? note that it is consistent that there is such a pair of sets <m> X , S </m> , with <m> | S | > | X | </m> , but no such <m> X </m> can be well-orderable . see here and here .

every totally disconnected separable metric space of dimension <m> n </m> homeomorphically embeds into <m> C \times \mathbb R ^ n </m> .
suppose there is a jointly convex function <m> f : \mathbb { R } \times \mathbb { R } \rightarrow \mathbb { R } </m> , <m> \mathbf { x } , \mathbf { y } \in \mathbb { R } ^ m </m> and <m> \mathbf { p } = [ p _ 1 \; \ldots \; p _ m ] ^ \top , \mathbf { q } = [ q _ 1 \; \ldots \; q _ m ] ^ \top </m> satisfying <m> \| p \| ^ 2 = \sum _ i p _ i ^ 2 = \| q \| ^ 2 = \sum _ j q _ j ^ 2 = 1 </m> , i want to find the bound of <m> f \left ( { \mathbf { p } ^ 2 } ^ \top \mathbf { x } , { \mathbf { q } ^ 2 } ^ \top \mathbf { y } \right ) </m> by decomposing it into weighted sum of <m> f ( x _ i , y _ j ) </m> if <m> \mathbf { p } , \mathbf { q } </m> are constrained in a manifold . the case without constraints of <m> \mathbf { p } </m> and <m> \mathbf { q } </m> denote the element-wise squared vector of <m> \mathbf { p } , \mathbf { q } </m> as <m> \mathbf { p } ^ 2 = [ p _ 1 ^ 2 \; \ldots \; p _ m ^ 2 ] ^ \top , \mathbf { q } ^ 2 = [ q _ 1 ^ 2 \; \ldots \; q _ m ^ 2 ] ^ \top , </m> then by jensen 's inequality for jointly convex function , we have <m>  </m> where <m> F _ { i j } = f ( x _ i , y _ j ) </m> . this provides a general bound for <m> f \left ( { \mathbf { p } ^ 2 } ^ \top \mathbf { x } , { \mathbf { q } ^ 2 } ^ \top \mathbf { y } \right ) </m> . suppose <m> C = [ c _ { i j } ] \_ { m \times m } </m> is an orthogonal matrix and the element squared matrix of <m> C </m> is <m> C ^ 2 = [ c _ { i j } ^ 2 ] \_ { m \times m } , </m> then <m> C ^ 2 </m> is a doubly stochastic matrix where <m> C ^ 2 \mathbf { 1 } = \mathbf { 1 } </m> and <m> { C ^ 2 } ^ \top \mathbf { 1 } = \mathbf { 1 } </m> . the case if with constraint <m> { \mathbf { q } ^ 2 } = { C ^ 2 } ^ \top \mathbf { p } ^ 2 </m> if an additional constraint <m> \mathbf { q } ^ 2 = { C ^ 2 } ^ \top \mathbf { p } ^ 2 </m> is applied so that <m> \mathbf { p } </m> and <m> \mathbf { q } </m> are constrained on a manifold , we can substitute the constraint into the inequality above , we get the bound <m> f \left ( { \mathbf { p } ^ 2 } ^ \top \mathbf { x } , { \mathbf { q } ^ 2 } ^ \top \mathbf { y } \right ) \leq { \mathbf { p } ^ 2 } ^ \top F { C ^ 2 } ^ \top \mathbf { p } ^ 2 </m> on the other hand , applying jensen 's inequality directly on the original formular , we can obtain another bound as <m>  </m> where <m> \circ </m> is the hadamard -LRB- element-wise -RRB- product . it is notable that this bound is simpler than the one obtained by substitution and has <m> \mathbf { p } </m> is homogeneous in both sides of the inequality . what is the case if with constraint <m> \mathbf { q } = C ^ \top \mathbf { p } </m> ? my question is that if the constraint is replaced with <m> \mathbf { q } = C ^ \top \mathbf { p } </m> , could we obtain the bound of <m> f \left ( { \mathbf { p } ^ 2 } ^ \top \mathbf { x } , { \mathbf { q } ^ 2 } ^ \top \mathbf { y } \right ) </m> with jensen 's equality ? if such a bound exists , could it have the simple form where <m> \mathbf { p } </m> similar to <m> { \mathbf { p } ^ 2 } ^ \top ( F \circ C ^ 2 ) \mathbf { 1 } </m> ? could anyone be so kind to give me some help on this problem ? any suggestion will be appreciated ! thank you very much !
i was wondering if anyone could give me some intuition as to why , for a smooth projective variety <m> X </m> over <m> \mathbf { C } </m> of complex dimension <m> d </m> , the tate twist on <m> H ^ n ( X ( \mathbf { C } ) , \mathbf { Z } ) </m> to be incorporated to have a pairing with <m> H _ { d - n } ( X ( \mathbf { C } ) , \mathbf { Z } ) </m> into <m> \mathbf { Z } ( - d ) </m> , is related to -LRB- tensor powers of -RRB- the cohomology group <m> H ^ 2 ( \mathbf { P } ^ 1 , \mathbf { Z } ) \simeq H ^ 1 ( \mathbf { G } _ m , \mathbf { Z } ) </m> . in other words , why does one often define <m> \mathbf { Z } ( - 1 ) : = H ^ 2 ( \mathbf { P } ^ 1 , \mathbf { Z } ) </m> ? is there some kunneth formula lurking behind the scene ? should i think about <m> X ( \mathbf { C } ) </m> as a family <m> X ( \mathbf { C } ) \times \mathbf { P } ^ 1 \to \mathbf { P } ^ 1 </m> ? is there a map <m> H ^ 2 ( ( \mathbf { P } ^ 1 ) ^ d , \mathbf { Z } ) \to H ^ d ( X ( \mathbf { C } ) , \mathbf { Z } ) </m> ? where does it come from ? i can understand the notation comes from <m> H _ 0 ( \mathbf { P } ^ 1 , \mathbf { Z } ) \simeq H _ 1 ( \mathbf { G } _ m , \mathbf { Z } ) \simeq \pi _ 1 ^ { \rm a b } ( \mathbf { G } _ m ) = \pi _ 1 ( \mathbf { G } _ m ) : = \mathbf { Z } ( 1 ) </m> , the reason i 'm asking the question : even if there is <m> H _ 0 ( X ( \mathbf { C } ) , \mathbf { Z } ) \to H _ 0 ( \mathbf { P } ^ 1 , \mathbf { Z } ) </m> , i see no map <m> X ( \mathbf { C } ) \to \mathbf { P } ^ 1 </m> in general . unless somehow <m> X ( \mathbf { C } ) </m> can always be realized as the fiber over some point of <m> \mathbf { P } ^ 1 </m> of some map <m> \mathcal { X } \to \mathbf { P } ^ 1 </m> , with <m> X </m> homotopy equivalent to <m> \mathcal { X } </m> . can one just choose <m> \mathcal { X } = X ( \mathbf { C } ) \times \mathbf { P } ^ 1 </m> ? -LRB- can it possibly be so simple ? in algebraic geometry , this would amount to taking the trivial deformation of <m> X \to * </m> to <m> \mathcal { X } \to \mathbf { P } ^ 1 </m> along a fixed point <m> * \to \mathbf { P } ^ 1 </m> , and trivial deformations strike me as usually not so interesting -RRB- . i 'll appreciate any insight on the matter a lot thanks
there is an example of a convex function of two variables that is convex but not absolutely continuous . the level set of this function is a convex curve . to construct one example of such a function one needs to take a cantor ladder <m> c </m> and define <m> f ( x , y ) = g ( x + y ) </m> where <m> g ( x ) = \int _ 0 ^ x c ( t ) d t </m> . is it possible to give a example of a convex curve whose support function is not absolutely continuous ?
bott periodicity implies that <m> \Omega ( S U ) \simeq G ( \infty ) </m> . here , by <m> G ( \infty ) </m> , i mean the direct limit <m> \underset { m \to \infty } { \lim } G _ m ( \mathbb { C } ^ { 2 m } ) </m> where <m> G _ m ( \mathbb { C } ^ { 2 m } ) \subset G _ { m + 1 } ( \mathbb { C } ^ { 2 m + 2 } ) </m> by stabilization -LRB- or some similar nice model for <m> B U </m> -RRB- . this is the classifying space for <m> U = \underset { m \to \infty } { \lim } U ( m ) </m> , and may be identified with <m> U / ( U \times U ) </m> , where the coordinates of each factor of the product subgroup alternate . from the path space construction , one knows that there is a contractible serre fibration <m> \Omega S U \to E \to S U </m> , where <m> E </m> is the space of paths in <m> S U </m> from the identity . the fibers are each homotopic to <m> G ( \infty ) </m> . the question i have is whether this may be realized by a contractible fiber bundle <m> G ( \infty ) \to E \to S U </m> ? other quasi-fibrations were given by aguilar and prieto , and by behrens . there are also fibrations of this sort constructed using symplectic reduction by latour and by giroux , where the fibers are homotopic to <m> G ( \infty ) </m> . what i 'm asking for is whether there exists a contractible fiber bundle rather than just a fibration or quasi-fibration ? presumably such a bundle would arise from a map <m> S U \to B D i f f ( G ( \infty ) ) </m> . the isometry group of <m> G ( \infty ) </m> contains <m> S U </m> , so one could ask a fortiori whether there is a map <m> S U \to B S U </m> , that is a map <m> f : S U \to G ( \infty ) </m> , such that the induced fiber bundle is contractible ? added clarification : the induced bundle would come from the fiber product of the pull-back of the <m> U </m> bundle <m> U \to E \to G ( \infty ) </m> with the action of <m> U </m> on <m> G ( \infty ) </m> : <m> f ^ { * } ( E ) \times _ { U } G ( \infty ) </m> .

a subset <m> X \subset \mathbb R </m> is called <m> \bullet </m> a <m> Q </m> - set if for every subset <m> A \subset X </m> there exists a <m> \sigma </m> - compact set <m> C \subset \mathbb R </m> such that <m> C \cap X = A </m> ; <m> \bullet </m> a strong <m> Q </m> - set if for every polish subspace <m> P \subset \mathbb R </m> and every subset <m> A \subset X \cap P </m> there exists a <m> \sigma </m> - compact set <m> C \subset P </m> such that <m> C \cap X = A </m> ; <m> \bullet </m> a universal <m> Q </m> - set if for every continuous injective map <m> f : P \to \mathbb R </m> form a polish space <m> P </m> and every subset <m> A \subset f ^ { - 1 } ( X ) </m> there exists a <m> \sigma </m> - compact set <m> C \subset P </m> such that <m> C \cap f ^ { - 1 } ( X ) = A </m> . it is clear that <m>  </m> \ rightarrow <m> u n i v e r s a l </m> q <m> - s e t </m> \ rightarrow <m> s t r o n g </m> q <m> - s e t </m> \ rightarrow <m>  </m> q <m>  </m> it can be shown that every <m> Q </m> - set <m> X \subset \mathbb R </m> of cardinality <m> X \le \mathfrak b </m> is a universal <m> Q </m> - set . let <m> \mathfrak q _ 0 </m> be the smallest cardinality <m> | X | </m> of a subset <m> X \subset \mathbb R </m> which is not a <m> Q </m> - set . it is known that <m> \mathfrak p \le \mathfrak q _ 0 \le \min \{ \mathfrak b , \mathrm { n o n } ( \mathcal N ) \} . </m> using the inequality <m> \mathfrak q _ 0 \le \mathfrak b </m> , it can be shown that every subset <m> X \subset \mathbb R </m> of cardinality <m> | X | < \mathfrak q _ 0 </m> is a universal <m> Q </m> - set . so , <m> \mathfrak q _ 0 </m> coincides with the smallest cardinality of a subset <m> X \subset \mathbb R </m> which fails to be a strong -LRB- or universal -RRB- <m> Q </m> - set . let <m> \mathfrak q </m> -LRB- resp . <m> \mathfrak { q _ s } </m> , <m> \mathfrak q _ u </m> -RRB- be the smallest cardinal <m> \kappa </m> such that every subset <m> X \subset \mathbb R </m> of cardinality <m> | X | \ge \kappa </m> is not a -LRB- resp . strong , universal -RRB- <m> Q </m> - set . it can be shown that <m> \mathfrak q _ 0 \le \min \{ \mathfrak b , \mathfrak q \} \le \mathfrak q _ u \le \mathfrak q _ s \le \mathfrak q \le \log ( \mathfrak c ^ + ) , </m> where <m> \log ( \mathfrak c ^ + ) : = \min \{ \kappa : 2 ^ \kappa > \mathfrak c \} </m> . so , under <m> 2 ^ { \omega _ 1 } > \mathfrak c </m> , <m> \mathfrak q = \omega _ 1 </m> , which means that every <m> Q </m> - set is countable . the consistency of the strict inequality <m> \mathfrak q _ 0 = \mathfrak b < \mathfrak q </m> was proved by judah and shelah .

i know that finite simple groups can be generated by two elements . -LRB- see this question on mo -RRB- so as a specific example , take alternating group <m> A _ { n } </m> , <m> n > 4 </m> . we also know that <m> A _ { n } </m> is <m> ( 2 , 3 ) </m> generated . i want to write a program , which takes a positive integer -LRB- <m> n > 4 </m> -RRB- as input and return two elements of <m> A _ { n } </m> one having order <m> 2 </m> and other having order <m> 3 </m> , also these two elements generate the whole group . but i am not able to write an algorithm . any hints .
if a positive radon measure <m> \mu </m> and the lebesgue measure <m> \lambda </m> are singular , can we show that the derivative of <m> \mu </m> with respect to <m> \lambda </m> is <m> \infty </m> , <m> \mu </m> - a.e. ? namely , can one show that <m> \frac { \mu ( B ( x , r ) ) } { \lambda ( B ( x , r ) ) } \to \infty \quad \mbox { a s } \ r \to 0 , \quad \mu \mbox { - a . e . ? } </m> does this result also hold for any pair of singular radon measures <m> \mu \, \bot \, \lambda </m> ? actually , a result i can find in -LSB- thm 1.29 , evans-gariepy , measure theory and fine properties of functions -RSB- is that , for any radon measures <m> \mu </m> and <m> \lambda </m> , <m> \lim _ { r \to 0 } \frac { \mu ( B ( x , r ) ) } { \lambda ( B ( x , r ) ) } < \infty \quad \mbox { a s } \quad r \to 0 , \quad \lambda \mbox { - a . e . } </m>
i am currently the convergence of different processes . doing this , i ended up with this expression and was wondering whether it is true that <m> \lim _ { n \rightarrow \infty } \sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { n } \frac { | ( 1 - \frac { n p _ n } { n } ) | ^ { n - k } - e ^ { - \lambda } | } { k ! } = 0 ? </m> - for the case that <m> n p _ n \rightarrow \lambda </m> and <m> p _ n \rightarrow 0 </m> .

my m.sc . student has the following question , that i assume has an answer in the literature , and we are looking for references . the generalized cantor space is the space <m> 2 ^ \kappa </m> , with basic open sets <m> [ \sigma ] : = \{ f \in 2 ^ \kappa : \sigma \subseteq f \} , </m> for <m> \sigma \in 2 ^ { < \kappa } </m> . a space is <m> \kappa </m> - compact if every open cover has a subcover of cardinality -LRB- strictly -RRB- smaller than <m> \kappa </m> . for which cardinals <m> \kappa </m> is the generalized cantor space <m> 2 ^ \kappa </m> <m> \kappa </m> - compact ? we are interested in strong limit cardinals <m> \kappa </m> , mainly strongly inaccessible <m> \kappa </m> . we would especially appreciate references . update : a related question .

short version given a cosimplicial space <m> X _ \bullet </m> , what is the relationship between -LRB- co -RRB- chains on the totalisation of <m> X _ \bullet </m> and the totalisation of the cosimplicial chain complex obtained by first taking chains levelwise ? <m> C h \left ( \| X _ \bullet \| \right ) \qquad \text { v s . } \qquad \| [ n ] \mapsto C h ( X _ n ) \| </m> background : simplicial objects , realisation , chains given a simplicial set , i can get a topological space by realisation . to do this we model every -LSB- n -RSB- by a topological space -LRB- the cosimplicial space of simplices -RRB- ; the realisation functor is then the left kan extension of this along the yoneda functor . in fact , this is part of a general game giving us nerve and realisation -LRB- ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nerve+and+realization -RRB- functors in many contexts . for example i can realise a simplicial abelian group as a chain complex using as my model the cosimplicial chain complex that maps -LSB- n -RSB- to normalised chains on the n simplex . -LRB- see also : dold-kan correspondence ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dold-kan+correspondence -RRB-

hurwitz 's theorem is an extension of minkowski 's theorem and deals with rational approximations to irrational numbers . the theorem states : for every irrational number <m> \alpha </m> , there are infinitely many coprime integers <m> p </m> and <m> q </m> such that : <m> \left | \alpha - \frac { p } { q } \right | < \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 5 } q ^ 2 } </m> it turns out that the <m> \sqrt { 5 } </m> term is sharp . my question is why does the <m> \sqrt { 5 } </m> term appear . what properties of <m> \sqrt { 5 } </m> enable this to be a sharp bound ? i am looking for an intuitive understanding .
i 've asked a related question about nine months ago here , however , apparently , i lacked expertise to ask the precise question i want to ask here , as i wish to revisit the matter of universes . i hope it will not count as a duplicate . one way to deal with set-theoretic difficulties when studying large categories are grothendieck universes . in practice , it means that instead of studying , for example , the category of all abelian groups <m> \mathrm { A b } </m> we `` fix '' an arbitrary universe <m> \mathrm { U } </m> and study the category <m> \mathrm { U \text { - } A b } </m> of all abelian groups which belong to <m> \mathrm { U } </m> . as <m> \mathrm { U } </m> was arbitrary , everything we prove about <m> \mathrm { U \text { - } A b } </m> will be true for all categories <m> \mathrm { V \text { - } A b } </m> for any universe <m> \mathrm { V } </m> . the thing that bothers me is : how can we circumvent the issue that we 're not working with all abelian groups . sure , adopting the axiom of universes -LRB- `` every set is contained in some universe '' -RRB- , for every abelian group <m> G </m> we have a an inverse <m> \mathrm { U } </m> containing it , and that means that we have a category <m> \mathrm { U \text { - } A b } </m> which contains <m> G </m> an object . but it does n't solve all issues , at least not right away . mike shulman in his notes says :
this question is probably obvious to experts but i could n't find the answer in the literature ... background : consider the mapping class group <m> M o d _ g </m> of the closed genus <m> g </m> surface . there are many nice sets of generators -LRB- i.e. humpreys famous <m> 2 g + 1 </m> dehn twists or wajnryb 's 2-element generating set etc -RRB- . if we consider the torelli group <m> \mathcal { I } _ g = M o d _ g [ 1 ] </m> , we know it is finitely generated by bounding pair maps . d. johnson proved that the next level in the johnson filtration <m> M o d _ g [ 2 ] </m> -LRB- now called the johnson kernel -RRB- is generated by dehn twists around separating curves . my question :

hello , my question probably is n't too hard , but i ca n't find the answer . let <m> K </m> be a number field , <m> \mathcal { X } / \mathcal { O } _ K </m> be an arithmetic surface , which is a regular model for a projective , smooth curve <m> X / K </m> and let <m> ( \mathcal { L } , | | \cdot | | ) </m> be a hermitian line bundle on <m> X </m> . then every point <m> P \in X ( K ) </m> admits a homomorphism <m> f _ P : S p e c \mathcal { O } _ K \to \mathcal { X } </m> . this is what is said and i do n't understand why <m> f _ P </m> must exist and what it does . thanks in advance for answers !

let <m> M </m> be a smooth manifold and let <m> \mathcal { C } ^ \infty ( M ) </m> be the space of all smooth real valued functions with the -LRB- strong -RRB- whitney topology . this space is a topological vector space iff <m> M </m> is compact . the maximal topological vector space in <m> \mathcal { C } ^ \infty ( M ) </m> for general <m> M </m> is the subspace <m> \mathcal { C } _ c ^ \infty ( M ) </m> of all compactly supported functions . i 'm looking for a reference that <m> \mathcal { C } ^ \infty _ c ( M ) </m> is a topological vector space . continuity of the addition for <m> \mathcal { C } ^ \infty ( M ) </m> is e.g. content of corollary 3.8 of `` stable mappings and their singularities '' of golubitsky and guillemin . i 'm lacking a reference for the fact that the scalar multiplication <m> \mathbb { R } \times \mathcal { C } ^ \infty _ c ( M ) \rightarrow \mathcal { C } ^ \infty _ c ( M ) </m> is continuous . preferably i would like to have a reference without much overload using the construction of the whitney topology either over local representations in charts or as the induced topology from the one of the jet bundle .

background : let <m> \mathbb Z ^ d </m> denote the <m> d </m> - dimensional integer lattice with norm <m> | x | = \sum _ i | x _ i | </m> . for each <m> x \in \mathbb Z ^ d </m> we associate a spin variable , <m> \sigma _ x </m> taking values on the set <m> \{ \exp ( 2 \pi i j / N ) ; 1 \leq j \leq N \} </m> with uniform a priori distribution . consider the formal hamiltonian given on the lattice <m> \mathbb Z ^ d </m> by <m> H _ { \Lambda } ( \{ \sigma \} ) = - \sum _ { \langle x , y \rangle } J _ { x y } \vec \sigma _ { x } \vec \sigma _ { y } </m> where <m> J _ { x y } </m> are nonnegative constants and <m> \vec \sigma _ x \vec \sigma _ y </m> is inner product in <m> \mathbb R ^ 2 </m> . the sum is taken over all pair of first neighbors <m> \langle x , y \rangle </m> means that <m> | x - y | = 1 </m> . the partition function on a finite <m> \Lambda \subset \mathbb Z ^ d </m> is given by <m> Z _ \Lambda = \int \exp \Big ( \beta \sum _ { \langle x , y \rangle \in \Lambda } J _ { x y } \vec \sigma _ x \vec \sigma _ y \Big ) \; d \sigma </m> where the integral is taken over all sites of <m> \Lambda </m> . the two point correlations are given by <m> \langle \vec \sigma _ x \vec \sigma _ y \rangle _ { \Lambda } = Z _ { \Lambda } ^ { - 1 } \int \vec \sigma _ x \vec \sigma _ y \exp \Big ( \beta \sum _ { \langle x , y \rangle \in \Lambda } J _ { x y } \vec \sigma _ x \vec \sigma _ y \Big ) d \sigma </m> question : for which values of <m> N </m> is known that the lieb-simon inequality is true or false ? lieb-simon inequality <m> \langle \vec \sigma _ x \vec \sigma _ y \rangle _ { \Lambda } \leq \sum _ { b \in \partial B } \bigl < \vec \sigma _ x \vec \sigma _ b \bigr > _ B \bigl < \vec \sigma _ b \vec \sigma _ y \bigr > _ \Lambda , </m> where <m> B \subset \Lambda \subset \mathbb Z ^ d </m> are finite , <m> x , y \in \Lambda </m> , <m> \partial B = \{ z \in B ; d ( z , B ^ c ) = 1 \} </m> and <m> \partial B </m> separates <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> -LRB- <m> i . e . </m> any path from <m> x </m> to <m> y </m> must intercept <m> \partial B </m> -RRB- .
following lam 's notation , a ring -LRB- with identity -RRB- <m> R </m> is called dedekind-finite if <m> a b = 1 \iff b a = 1 </m> in <m> R </m> . there are a lot of result about left invertible implies right invertible . but the results all require some finiteness property on the ring or the matrix ring . i am asking a proof or a couterexample of that that <m> R </m> is dedekind-finite impies that the matrix ring <m> \mathbb { M } _ n ( R ) </m> is dedekind-finite .
motivation : the following problem has occurred in a study of energy dissipation in a chain of coupled , damped oscillators . the problem : let me define specific rational functions <m> f </m> , <m> g </m> , and <m> h </m> from <m> \mathbb R _ + ^ n </m> into <m> \mathbb R _ + </m> -LRB- <m> n \geq 2 </m> -RRB- by the following expressions : <m>  </m> the dots in -LRB- 1a-c -RRB- indicate a continuation of the respective patterns , with as many terms as possible as long as the indices <m> i </m> on all involved <m> x _ i </m> remain within <m> \{ 1 , . . . , n \} </m> . i am interested in a meaningful `` minimization '' of the function <m> h </m> . from its definition above it is obvious that <m> h </m> is both strictly positive and a homogeneous function of degree 1 . for any <m> t \in \mathbb R _ + </m> then <m> h ( t \, x ) = t \, h ( x ) </m> , which shows that <m> h </m> has arbitrarily small values close to the origin of <m> \mathbb R ^ n </m> , and so it can not have a global minimum in <m> \mathbb R _ + ^ n </m> . an obvious way around this problem is to impose an additional constraint on <m> x </m> . because of the homogeneity of <m> h </m> , the natural choice is a constraint of the form <m> \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ n x _ i = c \ , \tag * { ( 2 ) } </m> with some constant <m> c > 0 </m> . without loss of generality , we can choose any fixed value , for instance <m> c = 1 </m> ; function values for any <m> c > 0 </m> are -LRB- by homogeneity of <m> h </m> -RRB- related to those for <m> c = 1 </m> by <m> h ( t \, x ) = t \, h ( x ) </m> , with <m> t = c ^ { 1 / n } </m> . we know that , on the hypersurface <m> \mathbb H _ c ^ n = \{ x \in \mathbb R _ + ^ n \! : \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ n x _ i = c \} </m> defined by the constraint -LRB- 2 -RRB- , <m> h </m> must have a minimum since it is continuous -LRB- even <m> C ^ \infty </m> -RRB- in <m> \mathbb R _ + ^ n </m> and -LRB- proposition 1 :-RRB- if <m> x _ i \to \infty </m> for some <m> i </m> , or if <m> x \in \mathbb H _ c ^ n </m> approaches the boundary of <m> \mathbb R _ + ^ n </m> , then <m> h ( x ) \to \infty </m> . proposition 1 is easily proved as follows . noting that <m> h ( x ) > x _ 1 + \cdots + x _ n </m> , the first part is obvious . for the second part , let us assume that <m> x _ i < \epsilon </m> for some <m> i </m> . then due to the constraint -LRB- 2 -RRB- there is at least one <m> j </m> such that <m> x _ j > ( c / \epsilon ) ^ { \frac 1 { n - 1 } } </m> , whence <m> h ( x ) > ( c / \epsilon ) ^ { \frac 1 { n - 1 } } </m> . consequently , if <m> \epsilon \to 0 </m> then <m> h ( x ) \to \infty </m> . the question now is , at which point -LRB- s -RRB- <m> x _ { \rm m i n } \in \mathbb H _ c ^ n </m> is this minimum located , and what is the value <m> h _ { \rm m i n } = h ( x _ { \rm m i n } ) </m> ? any minimum of <m> h </m> on <m> \mathbb H _ c ^ n </m> must also be a stationary point of <m> h </m> on <m> \mathbb H _ c ^ n </m> -LRB- i.e. , the gradient of <m> h </m> in <m> H _ c ^ n </m> must vanish at that point -RRB- . i believe that for any given <m> n </m> there is only one stationary point of <m> h </m> on <m> \mathbb H _ c ^ n </m> , which then also must be its -LRB- unique -RRB- minimum . unfortunately , i can not prove this yet , but i can prove the existence of a remarkably simple stationary point :
let <m> a _ 1 \ge a _ 2 \ge \cdots \ge a _ n \ge 0 </m> be given non-negative numbers . my question is the following :
given <m> d \in \mathbb { N } </m> , let <m> X _ d : = \{ ( \ell _ 1 , \ldots , \ell _ d ) : 0 \le \ell _ 1 \le \ldots \le \ell _ d \le d \} \subset \mathbb { Z } ^ d </m> , and endow <m> X _ d </m> with the -LRB- usual -RRB- partial order , namely , <m> x \le y </m> if and only if <m> x _ j \le y _ j </m> for all <m> j = 1 , \ldots , d </m> . note that if <m> Y \subset X _ d </m> is linearly ordered then <m> \# Y \le d ^ 2 + 1 </m> . let <m> N _ d </m> be the number of linearly ordered subsets of <m> X _ d </m> of maximal length , that is , <m> N _ d : = \# \{ Y \subset X _ d : Y \mbox { l i n e a r l y o r d e r e d , } \# Y = d ^ 2 + 1 \} </m> . my question : is there any neat expression available for <m> N _ d </m> ? if not , perhaps at least the asymptotics of <m> N _ d </m> as <m> d \to \infty </m> can be worked out ? any answers or pertinent references will be much appreciated .

let <m> Y </m> be an integral normal 2-dimensional scheme and let <m> X \longrightarrow S </m> be a flat projective morphism , where <m> S </m> is a dedekind scheme . let <m> f : X \longrightarrow Y </m> be a minimal resolution of singularities . assume that <m> X </m> is semi-stable over <m> S </m> . in particular , <m> X </m> is minimal and does n't contain any <m> ( - 1 ) </m> - curves . let <m> y </m> be a singular point of <m> Y </m> and let <m> E _ 1 , \ldots , E _ r </m> be the exceptional components of <m> f </m> lying over <m> y </m> . fix <m> j \in \{ 1 , \ldots , r \} </m> . do we have that <m> \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ r ( E _ i , E _ j ) \leq 0 ? </m> here <m> ( \cdot , \cdot ) </m> denotes the intersection pairing on the regular fibered surface <m> X </m> . for any <m> j \in \{ 1 , \ldots , r \} </m> , i know that <m> X _ y \cdot E _ j = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ r d _ i ( E _ i , E _ j ) \leq 0 , </m> where <m> d _ i </m> is the multiplicity of <m> E _ i </m> .
is it consistent with zfc that there exists an uncountable separable metric space <m> X </m> such that every subset of <m> X </m> is a borel set ? if the continuum hypothesis holds , or more generally <m> 2 ^ { \aleph _ { 0 } } < 2 ^ { \aleph _ { 1 } } </m> , then each uncountable separable metric space contains non-borel sets since there are only <m> 2 ^ { \aleph _ { 0 } } </m> borel sets . therefore , in order for there to be an uncountable separable metric space <m> X </m> where every subset of <m> X </m> is borel , we would need to at least have <m> 2 ^ { \aleph _ { 0 } } = 2 ^ { \aleph _ { 1 } } </m> . what other conditions are necessary in order for there to exist an uncountable separable metric space <m> X </m> where every subset of <m> X </m> is borel ?
operations such as taking union or cartesian products of spaces have direct analogues in term of algebra of functions on them -LRB- direct sum and tensor product , respectively -RRB- , my question is : is there a way to determine the structure of <m> C ^ { \infty } ( M \# N ) </m> in terms of the function spaces <m> C ^ { \infty } ( M ) </m> and <m> C ^ { \infty } ( N ) </m> ? or how is the operation of taking the connected sum of two closed manifold reflected in the algebra of observables ? are there any similar methods used in algebraic geometry or homotopy theory ?
this is a question on the proof of this fact in chapter 3 of the book `` functional analysis : surveys and recent results ii '' . there at the end the proof is outlined as follows : let <m> \mu </m> be a shift invariant measure on <m> X = \{ 0 , 1 \} ^ \mathbb { Z } </m> . for each subset <m> \Lambda \subset \mathbb { Z } </m> define <m> C _ \Lambda </m> to be the subset of continuous functions on <m> X </m> , <m> C _ \Lambda \subset C ( X ) </m> which depend only on coordinates indexed by <m> \Lambda </m> . let <m> \mu _ \Lambda </m> be the restriction of <m> \mu </m> to <m> C _ \Lambda </m> . now let <m> \Lambda _ n = [ 1 , n ] </m> and define <m> \nu _ n = \otimes _ { k \in \mathbb { Z } } \mu _ { s h i f t ^ { k n } ( \Lambda _ n ) } </m> . now define <m> \mu _ n = \frac { 1 } { n } \sum _ { s = 0 } ^ { n - 1 } s h i f t ^ { s } _ * ( \nu _ n ) . </m> then <m> \nu _ n </m> and <m> \mu _ n </m> are ergodic . also <m> \mu _ n = \nu _ n = \mu </m> on <m> C _ { \Lambda _ n } </m> , hence <m> \mu _ n \to \mu </m> . i do not understand precisely this last statement , that <m> \mu _ n = \mu </m> on <m> C _ { \Lambda _ n } </m> . i do n't know how to show it even for <m> n = 2 </m> : since <m> C _ { \Lambda _ 2 } = C _ { [ 1 ] } \otimes C _ { [ 2 ] } </m> , any element of <m> C _ { \Lambda _ 2 } </m> is a linear combination of functions <m> f ( \omega _ 1 ) g ( \omega _ 2 ) </m> . so if <m> \mu _ 2 = \nu _ 2 </m> one must have <m> \int f ( \omega _ 1 ) g ( \omega _ 2 ) d \mu _ { \Lambda _ 2 } = \int f ( \omega _ 1 ) d \mu _ { [ 1 ] } \int g ( \omega _ 2 ) d \mu _ { [ 2 ] } , </m> which i do n't see why should hold for any <m> \mu </m> .
in the paper <m> p </m> - adic l-functions and <m> p </m> - adic periods of modular forms of greenberg and stevens <m> \S 3 </m> page <m> 4 2 0 </m> they make the following statement : let <m> A </m> over <m> \mathbf { Q } _ p </m> be an abelian variety with split multiplicative reduction and <m> B </m> be its dual . let <m> X , Y </m> be the character groups of <m> B ^ 0 _ { \mathbf { F } _ p } </m> and <m> A ^ 0 _ { \mathbf { F } _ p } </m> with trivial <m> G _ { \mathbf { Q } _ p } </m> action . then from the theory of <m> p </m> - adic uniformization we get a multiplicative pairing <m> j : X \times Y \to \mathbf { Q } _ p ^ * </m> and exact sequences of <m> G _ { \mathbf { Q } _ p } </m> modules <m> 0 \to X \xrightarrow { \; j \; } \text { H o m } ( Y , \overline { \mathbf { Q } } _ p ^ * ) \longrightarrow A ( \overline { \mathbf { Q } } _ p ) \longrightarrow 0 </m> <m> 0 \to Y \xrightarrow { \; j \; } \text { H o m } ( X , \overline { \mathbf { Q } } _ p ^ * ) \longrightarrow B ( \overline { \mathbf { Q } } _ p ) \longrightarrow 0 </m> furthermore the pairing <m> \alpha : o r d _ p \circ j : X \times Y \to \mathbf { Z } </m> is non degenerate . they give two references for this : mccabe 's thesis at harvard '' <m> p </m> - adic theta functions '' which i have n't found on line and morikawa : `` on theta functions and abelian varieties over valuation fields of rank one , part i and part ii '' from where i have n't been able to extract the mentioned result . my question is : does anyone know of a good reference for this or can explain to me how to obtain the result from morikawa 's paper ?

let 's write <m> S </m> for the <m> K ( 1 ) </m> - local sphere at the prime 2 . then there is a cofibre sequence <m> S \to K O \to K O </m> where i 'm using <m> K O </m> to denote the <m> K ( 1 ) </m> - localization of orthogonal k-theory , and the self map of <m> K O </m> is given in terms of adams operations : <m> \psi ^ 3 - 1 </m> . drew heard reminded me that on <m> \pi _ 1 </m> , <m> \psi ^ 3 - 1 = 0 </m> is the trivial endomorphism of <m> \mathbb { Z } / 2 = \pi _ 1 K O </m> ; this yields the computation <m> \pi _ 0 ( S ) = \mathbb { Z } _ 2 \oplus \mathbb { Z } / 2 , </m> where the 2-adic factor comes from <m> \pi _ 0 K O </m> , and the <m> \mathbb { Z } / 2 </m> gets carried around from <m> \pi _ 1 K O </m> by the connecting map in the cofibre sequence . my question is : what is the ring structure on <m> \pi _ 0 ( S ) </m> ? it is certainly a <m> \mathbb { Z } _ 2 </m> - algebra , so this describes most of the multiplication . if i write <m> x </m> for an additive generator of <m> \mathbb { Z } / 2 </m> -LRB- the image of the connecting map -RRB- , then the only remaining computation is a formula for <m> x ^ 2 </m> . since <m> 2 x = 0 </m> , <m> 2 x ^ 2 = 0 </m> , so it must be the case that either <m> x ^ 2 = 0 </m> or <m> x ^ 2 = x </m> , since these are the only 2-torsion elements of the ring . is it known which of these two possibilities holds ?
i gave this problem to my undergraduate assistant , as i saw that euler had originally solved it -LRB- although i am having trouble finding his proof -RRB- . after working on it for two weeks , we boiled the hard cases down to showing that -LRB- 1 -RRB- in <m> \mathbb { Z } [ w ] </m> the fundamental unit is <m> 1 + w + w ^ 2 </m> -LRB- where <m> w </m> is the real cube-root of 2 -RRB- -LSB- which i 'm sorry to say , i 'm not certain i know off the top of my head how to prove -RSB- , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- using that fundamental unit , i found a crazy ad hoc computation to show that there are only the obvious solutions . so i 'm wondering if someone else out there is more clever , knows where i can find euler 's proof , or if there is another nice elementary proof in the literature .
let <m> \quad - 1 = x _ 0 < x _ 1 < \ . . . \ < x _ n < 1 \quad </m> be a set of abscissas and <m> \quad ( y _ 0 , y _ 1 , \ . . . \, y _ n ) \quad </m> a sequence of the corresponding ordinates .
can the number of solutions <m> x y ( x - y - 1 ) = n </m> for <m> x , y , n \in Z </m> be unbounded as n varies ? x , y are integral points on an elliptic curve and are easy to find using enumeration of divisors of n -LRB- assuming n can be factored -RRB- . if yes , will large number of solutions give moderate rank ec ? if one drops <m> - 1 </m> i.e. <m> x y ( x - y ) = n </m> the number of solutions can be unbounded via multiples of rational point -LRB- s -RRB- and then multiplying by a cube . -LRB- explanation -RRB- : another unbounded case for varying <m> a , n </m> is <m> x y ( x - y - a ) = n </m> . if <m> ( x , y ) </m> is on the curve then <m> ( d x , d y ) </m> is on <m> x y ( x - y - a d ) = n d ^ 3 </m> . find many rational points and multiply by a suitable <m> d </m> . not using the group law seems quite tricky for me . the constant <m> - 1 </m> was included on purpose in the initial post . i would be interested in this computational experiment : find <m> n </m> that gives a lot of solutions , say <m> 1 0 0 </m> -LRB- i ca n't do it -RRB- , check which points are linearly independent and this is a lower bound on the rank . what i find intriguing is that all integral points in this model come from factorization/divisors only .
in an introductory lecture note by t. saito , http://www.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~t-saito/pp/gr2.pdf he said that the absolute galois group <m> \text { G a l } ( \bar { \mathbb { Q } } / \mathbb { Q } ) </m> could be seen as the fundamental group of the set set of primes <m> 2 , 3 , 5 , . . . \infty </m> . the local systems over <m> 2 , 3 , 5 , . . . \infty </m> could be seen as determined by the representations of <m> \text { G a l } ( \bar { \mathbb { Q } } / \mathbb { Q } ) </m> . could anyone elaborate on this analogy ? in what sense does the analogy catch the essence of galois representations ?
let <m> f : X ' \to X </m> be a finite flat morphism of -LRB- nice -RRB- schemes and <m> \mathscr { A } / X ' </m> be a smooth commutative group scheme such that the weil restriction <m> f _ * \mathscr { A } / X </m> is representable by a commutative group scheme . are there criteria when <m> \mathrm { R } ^ 1 f _ { * , \mathrm { f p p f } } \mathscr { A } </m> is representable by a -LRB- smooth -RRB- group scheme -LRB- or algebraic space -RRB- ? for <m> \mathscr { A } = \mathbf { G } _ m </m> , this is the picard functor .

let <m> G </m> be a lie group and <m> C _ r ^ * ( G ) </m> and <m> C ^ * ( G ) </m> be its reduced and maximal group <m> C ^ * </m> - algebras respectively . the left-regular representation of a group <m> G </m> induces a surjective map <m> \lambda _ G : C ^ * ( G ) \rightarrow C ^ * _ r ( G ) , </m> so <m> C _ r ^ * ( G ) </m> is a quotient of <m> C ^ * ( G ) </m> . i am wondering whether <m> C _ r ^ * ( G ) </m> is in fact a direct summand of <m> C ^ * ( G ) </m> ? thanks for your help . edit : as ycor commented , more precisely what i am looking for is a <m> * </m> - homomorphism <m> f : C _ r ^ * ( G ) \rightarrow C ^ * ( G ) </m> such that <m> \lambda _ G \circ f = \text { i d } _ { C _ r ^ * ( G ) } </m> and <m> f ( x ) y = 0 </m> for all <m> x \in C _ r ^ * ( G ) </m> and <m> y \in \ker \lambda _ G </m> . that is , a direct summand in the sense of <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra direct sums .
let <m> p </m> be an odd prime , and let <m> ( \frac { \cdot } p ) </m> denote the legendre symbol . motivated by my question http://mathoverflow.net/questions/310301 , here i introduce the matrices <m> A ^ + _ p </m> and <m> A ^ - _ p </m> whose definitions are as follows : <m> A ^ + _ p = [ a _ { i j } ^ + ] _ { 1 \le i , j \le ( p - 1 ) / 2 } \ \text { w i t h } \ a _ { 1 j } ^ + = \left ( \frac j p \right ) \ \text { a n d } \ a _ { i j } ^ + = \left ( \frac { i + j } p \right ) \ \text { f o r } \ i > 1 , </m> <m> A ^ - _ p = [ a _ { i j } ^ - ] _ { 1 \le i , j \le ( p - 1 ) / 2 } \ \text { w i t h } \ a _ { 1 j } ^ - = \left ( \frac j p \right ) \ \text { a n d } \ a _ { i j } ^ - = \left ( \frac { i - j } p \right ) \ \text { f o r } \ i > 1 . </m> question : let <m> p \equiv 3 \pmod 4 </m> be a prime . is it true that <m> \det A _ p ^ - = ( - 1 ) ^ { ( p - 3 ) / 4 } ? </m> when <m> p > 3 </m> , is it true that <m> \det A _ p ^ + = - 2 ^ { ( p - 3 ) / 2 } </m> ? based on my computation , i conjecture that the question has a positive answer .
it is probably a trivial question . but i do n't see the answer . is there any hurewicz fibration <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n \to \mathbb { S } ^ n </m> ? is there any fibration <m> X \to \mathbb { S } ^ n </m> , when <m> X \subset \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> ? i appreciate any help . thank you very much !

for sake of brevity let <m> A </m> denote the banach algebra formed by equipping <m> \ell ^ 1 ( { \mathbb N } ) </m> with pointwise multiplication . this algebra is clearly not isomorphic as a banach algebra to any uniform algebra -LRB- since it has idempotents of arbitrarily large norm -RRB- . it has been known since the 1970s that there exists a hilbert space <m> H </m> and a continuous injective algebra homomorphism <m> \theta : A \to B ( H ) </m> which has -LRB- norm - -RRB- closed range . that is , <m> A </m> is isomorphic to a non-self-adjoint operator algebra . however , the proof is non-explicit ; the only argument i have seen uses the fact that multiplication <m> A \otimes A \to A </m> extends continuously to the injective tensor product of <m> A </m> with itself , and then uses abstract gns-flavoured techniques to build the required space <m> H </m> . see
as the title suggests , i 'm trying to apply the adams spectral sequence to get some insights of the bordism group <m> \Omega _ 4 ( \xi ) = \pi _ 4 ( M \xi ) </m> where <m> \xi \colon B S p i n \times K ( D _ { 2 n } , 1 ) \to B S O </m> is a stable vector bundle . i 'm trying to use ass because after an application of the james spectral sequence -LRB- kind of twisted ahss -RRB- i was able to conclude that <m> \Omega _ 4 ( \xi ) = \mathbb { Z } \ \text { o r } \mathbb { Z } \oplus \mathbb { Z } _ 2 </m> here you can find a little bit of context and some description of my previous attempts . my idea is that a computation of <m> _ { ( 2 ) } { \pi _ 4 ( M \xi ) } </m> should give me the right choice for <m> \Omega _ 4 ( \xi ) </m> , therefore i try to run an ass . my lack of expertise in this field lead me to ask a question about how to start the ass , since i think it 's easier to study the ass with a clear problem in mind , otherwise i would n't understand the importance of a lot of technical lemmas done in many of the books covering it . so the ass i 'm interested in should look like this <m> E ^ { s , t } _ 2 \cong E x t _ { \mathcal { A } _ 2 } ^ { s , t } ( H ^ * ( M \xi ; \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) ; \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) </m>
let <m> B r _ 3 : = \langle \tau _ 1 , \tau _ 2 \ : \ \tau _ 1 \tau _ 2 \tau _ 1 = \tau _ 2 \tau _ 1 \tau _ 2 \rangle </m> be the braid group on three strands , and consider the surjection <m> \phi : B r _ 3 \twoheadrightarrow S L _ 2 ( \mathbb Z ) , \qquad \tau _ 1 \mapsto \begin {pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end {pmatrix} , \quad \tau _ 2 \mapsto \begin {pmatrix} 1 & - 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end {pmatrix} . </m> according to wikipedia , this is the universal central extension . moreover , it arises as the fiber product of the inclusion <m> S L _ 2 ( \mathbb Z ) \hookrightarrow S L _ 2 ( \mathbb R ) </m> and the universal cover <m> \widetilde { S L _ 2 ( \mathbb R ) } \twoheadrightarrow S L _ 2 ( \mathbb R ) </m> .
question numerical calculation with gp -LRB- first to the default 38-digit precision , then tripled -RRB- supports the conjecture that <m> \int _ 0 ^ \infty x \, [ J _ 0 ( x ) ] ^ 5 \, d x = \frac { \Gamma ( 1 / 1 5 ) \, \Gamma ( 2 / 1 5 ) \, \Gamma ( 4 / 1 5 ) \, \Gamma ( 8 / 1 5 ) } { 8 \sqrt { 5 } \, \pi ^ 4 } = \frac { 2 } { \sqrt { 5 } \, \Gamma ( 7 / 1 5 ) \, \Gamma ( 1 1 / 1 5 ) \, \Gamma ( 1 3 / 1 5 ) \, \Gamma ( 1 4 / 1 5 ) } </m> -LSB- the two gamma expressions are easily proved equal via the identity <m> \Gamma ( x ) \Gamma ( 1 - x ) = \pi / \sin ( \pi x ) </m> ; the hard part is proving that either of them equals the definite integral -RSB- . is this a known formula ? if not , is it worth working out and writing up a proof ?

let <m> \mathsf { Z F C } ^ - </m> be the zermelo-fraenkel set theory without power set axiom . for a transitive model <m> M </m> of <m> \mathsf { Z F C } ^ - </m> and an cardinal <m> \kappa \in M </m> in the sense of <m> M </m> , an unary predicate <m> U </m> over <m> M </m> is an <m> \kappa </m> - complete ultrafilter if <m> M </m> thinks it is <m> \kappa </m> - complete and <m> U </m> is weakly amenable , that is , for any <m> F \in { ^ \kappa } M \cap M </m> , <m> \{ \xi < \kappa : F ( \xi ) \in U \} \in M </m> . <m> M </m> thinks <m> \kappa </m> is weakly compect . i think in fact we can show <m> M </m> thinks <m> \kappa </m> is ramsey . however it does not tell about their consistency strength as <m> \mathsf { Z F C } ^ - </m> is far more weaker than <m> \mathsf { Z F C } </m> . my question is , the exact consistency strength of the existence of the model <m> M \models \mathsf { Z F C } ^ - </m> with a <m> \kappa </m> - complete ultrafilter over <m> M </m> is known ? theorem 1.1 of an article by gitman and close relation between <m> \kappa </m> - complete ultrafilter and elementray embedding suggests its consistency strength may be related to the existence of a weakly compact cardinal .
let <m> X </m> be a 2-site and consider the category of 2-presheaves over <m> X </m> , which will be denoted as <m> P s h v ( X ; C a t ) </m> . these are <m> C a t </m> - valued 2-functors , where <m> C a t </m> is the 2-category of categories . there is a functor `` 2-sheafification '' <m> L : P s h v ( X ; C a t ) \rightarrow S h v ( X ; C a t ) </m> , which is left adjoint to the inclusion <m> i : S h v ( X ; C a t ) \rightarrow P s h v ( X ; C a t ) </m> . my question is : how does 2-sheafification work with 2-presheaves valued in 2-categories other than <m> C a t </m> ? i have in mind 2-categories with `` extra structure '' , for example 2-functors valued in the 2-category of monoidal categories . <m> \mathbf { E d i t } </m> : the following is from the nlab 's entry on sheafification : if a category a satisfies the following assumptions , sheafification of presheaves in <m> [ S ^ { o p } , A ] </m> exists and is constructed analogously as for set-valued sheaves . a admits small limits ; a admits small colimits ; small filtered colimits in a are exact ; a satisfies the ipc-property . maybe the answer to my question is related to the target 2-category satisfying 2-categorical versions of the above conditions ?

does there exist a polynomial-time algorithm to determine whether a given polynomial <m> p ( n ) </m> with integer coefficients is positive on <m> \mathbb { N } </m> , in the sense that <m> p ( n ) \geq 0 </m> for all <m> n \in \mathbb { N } </m> ? this question seems to be related , but it involves multivariable polynomials and asks about positivity on all of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> , and the answer does n't seem to apply to single-variable polynomials . edit : just to clarify , the input for the algorithm should be a string that encodes the polynomial <m> p </m> in a reasonably compact fashion , e.g. the digits of the degree of <m> p </m> followed by the digits of the coefficients .
in `` meyer sets and their duals '' moody proves that any meyer set union a finite number of points is again a meyer set . additionally , any meyer set is contained in a finite union of model sets whose internal space -LRB- the space you are projecting from -RRB- is <m> \mathbb { R } ^ d . </m> thus it is clear that any finite collection of points in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ m </m> is contained in many model sets . given a finite set <m> \Lambda \subset \mathbb { R } ^ m </m> can we find a <m> \textbf { s i n g l e } </m> cut and project set containing <m> \Lambda </m> with internal space <m> \mathbb { R } ^ d ? </m>

our research group is currently going through the paper by thomas nikolaus and peter scholze on topological cyclic homology and in the appendix b , proposition b. 5 . , they use the notation <m> F u n ^ { B \mathbb Z } ( \mathcal C , \mathcal D ) </m> for the <m> \infty - </m> category of <m> B \mathbb Z </m> - equivariant functors between two <m> \infty - </m> categories <m> \mathcal C , \mathcal D </m> with <m> B \mathbb Z </m> action . the notation has n't been defined before , at least we could n't find a definition , and a quick look at lurie 's hht did n't give anything either . my assumption is that for a simplicial group <m> G </m> we can define <m> F u n ^ { G } ( \mathcal C , \mathcal D ) </m> as a full subcategory of <m> F u n ( B G , F u n ( \mathcal C , \mathcal D ) ) </m> . two major properties that are used are :
in chang and keisler 's model theory i came across the following theorem -LRB- theorem 7.2.13 -RRB- : theorem there exists a -LRB- first-order -RRB- sentence <m> \sigma </m> such that for all infinite cardinals <m> \alpha </m> , <m> \sigma </m> admits <m> ( \alpha ^ { + + } , \alpha ) </m> iff there exists an <m> \alpha </m> - kurepa tree . definitions -LRB- 1 -RRB- fix a predicate <m> P </m> in the language of <m> \sigma </m> . then <m> \sigma </m> admits <m> ( \kappa , \lambda ) </m> if there is a model <m> M </m> of <m> \sigma </m> with <m> | M | = \kappa </m> and <m> | P ^ M | = \lambda </m> . obviously , <m> \kappa \ge \lambda </m> . -LRB- 2 -RRB- an <m> \alpha </m> - kurepa tree has height <m> \alpha ^ + </m> , each level has at most <m> \alpha </m> elements and there are at least <m> \alpha ^ { + + } </m> elements of height <m> \alpha ^ + </m> . although <m> \sigma </m> is not explicitly defined in chang and keisler , i am assuming it says something like : there is a predicate <m> P </m> , there is a surjection from <m> P </m> to each level , the levels of the tree are linearly ordered , and there is a surjection from <m> P </m> to every initial segment of this linear order . i see this sentence works under gch , but i have a hard time when gch fails . consider for instance the case when <m> \alpha = \aleph _ 0 </m> and , say <m> 2 ^ { \aleph _ 0 } = \aleph _ 2 </m> . then we can cook up a model of the above sentence that resembles <m> ( \omega ^ { < \omega } , \subset ) </m> with <m> \omega ^ \omega </m> many cofinal branches . this model will be have type <m> ( \aleph _ 2 , \aleph _ 0 ) </m> . by a theorem of devlin , we can find a model of zfc where there is no kurepa tree and the continuum is <m> \aleph _ 2 </m> . thus , it is consistent that <m> \sigma </m> will have models of type <m> ( \aleph _ 2 , \aleph _ 0 ) </m> , while there are no kurepa trees . my question : do i miss something `` obvious '' , or is the above theorem true only under gch ?
i am looking for a proof -LRB- or better , a reference -RRB- of the following fact : the finite support iteration of <m> \sigma </m> - centered forcing notions is again <m> \sigma </m> - centered , assuming we iterate less than <m> ( 2 ^ { \aleph _ 0 } ) ^ + </m> steps . -LRB- edit : in the first version of the question i forgot to mention that it was stefan geschke who suggested that there should be a proof similar to `` the product of continuum many separable spaces is still separable '' -RRB- edit : in his 1994 paper '' <m> \sigma </m> - centred forcing and reflection of -LRB- sub -RRB- metrizability '' in tams -LRB- mr1179593 94g : 54003 -RRB- , frank tall writes :
hi , given a discrete simple random walk on a symmetric graph , what is known about the probability of the random walker to return to a starting site at step <m> n </m> ? specifically , i am interested in the probability that at step <m> n </m> the random walk has returned to its starting vertex . what i have found is e.g. in the book `` markov chains '' by norris that shows for random walk on a line in <m> Z ^ 1 </m> the probability to return at step <m> 2 n </m> is <m> p _ { 0 0 } ^ { ( 2 n ) } = \binom { 2 n } { n } \left ( \frac { 1 } { 2 } \right ) ^ { 2 n } </m> . furthermore , norris shows that for a lattice in <m> Z ^ 2 </m> this return probability at step <m> n </m> is <m> p _ { 0 0 } ^ { ( 2 n ) } = \left ( \binom { 2 n } { n } \left ( \frac { 1 } { 2 } \right ) ^ { 2 n } \right ) ^ 2 </m> . what is known for finite graphs -LRB- e.g. finite lines in <m> Z ^ 1 </m> and finite regular lattices in <m> Z ^ 2 </m> which i guess can easily be extended from the above by including special cases to be at the border -RRB- and is there more known for special families of finite graphs ? e.g. is there something known for regular graphs given a degree and size of the graph , or for rings etc. thanks , christoph
i would like to know whether it is possible to obtain the bounds <m> \sqrt { r ( x ) } \ll k ( x ) \ll r ( x ) </m> where <m> k ( x ) = { \pi ( x + r ( x ) ) - \pi ( x - r ( x ) ) } </m> and <m> 1 \ll r ( x ) \ll \log ^ { 4 } ( x ) </m> and thus <m> 1 \ll \dfrac { r ( x ) } { \pi ( x + r ( x ) ) - \pi ( x - r ( x ) ) } \ll \log ^ { 2 } x </m> with current technology unconditionally , or if we need rather strong conjectures like -LRB- g -RRB- rh and/or the generalized elliott-halberstam conjecture . has such a question been investigated so far ? if so , are there interesting references to read ? many thanks in advance . edited after the second comment below : does rh imply that , if <m> \beta : = \inf \{ c , \limsup \dfrac { p _ { n + 1 } - p _ { n } } { \log ^ { c } p _ { n } } = O ( 1 ) \} </m> then <m> \beta = 2 </m> ?
consider the fourier transform of <m> e ^ { i t | \xi | ^ { 2 \alpha } } </m> -LRB- <m> \alpha > 0 </m> -RRB- in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> , let <m> K _ { \alpha } = \mathcal { F } ( e ^ { i t | \xi | ^ { \alpha } } ) </m> , so <m> K </m> is a tempered distribution.now i want to know if there is a explicit expression of <m> K </m> , for the simpliest case , namely <m> \alpha = 1 </m> , it 's well known that <m> K _ 1 = ( 4 \pi i t ) ^ { - \frac { n } { 2 } } e ^ { - \frac { | x | ^ 2 } { 4 i t } } </m> another special case is <m> \alpha = \frac { 1 } { 2 } </m> , since we know that <m> \mathcal { F } e ^ { - t | \xi | } = C _ { n } \frac { t } { ( t ^ { 2 } + | \xi | ^ 2 ) ^ { \frac { n + 1 } { 2 } } } </m> , where <m> t > 0 </m> , let <m> t = - i t </m> , so at least formally , <m> K _ { \frac { 1 } { 2 } } = C _ { n } \frac { - i t } { ( | \xi | ^ 2 - t ^ { 2 } ) ^ { \frac { n + 1 } { 2 } } } </m> my question is how about general <m> \alpha </m> ? , so far i have known that when <m> 0 < \alpha < \frac { 1 } { 2 } </m> , <m> \alpha = \frac { 1 } { 2 } </m> , <m> \alpha > \frac { 1 } { 2 } </m> , the singularity of <m> K </m> lies at <m> 0 </m> , <m> t = | x | </m> , <m> \infty </m> respectively .
looking at the images below , you recognize that the adjacency matrix of the graph <m> A _ G </m> splits up into three different colored submatrices , with <m> A _ G = A _ r + A _ b + A _ d </m> -LRB- where <m> d </m> is dark , damn ... -RRB- . it 's obvious that <m> A _ k ^ 2 = 1 </m> . now have a look a the right coloring : you 'll see that <m> ( A _ d A _ r ) ^ 2 = ( A _ r A _ b ) ^ 2 = ( A _ b A _ d ) ^ 2 = 1 </m> as well . let 's use <m> a , b , c </m> instead . we summarize this as : <m> \langle a , b , c | a ^ 2 = b ^ 2 = c ^ 2 = ( a b ) ^ 2 = ( b c ) ^ 2 = ( c a ) ^ 2 = 1 \rangle = \Delta ( 2 , 2 , 2 ) </m> this is a presentation of a triangle group <m> \Delta ( 2 , 2 , 2 ) </m> , a special kind of coxeter group . the left image resembles the situation :
do we know the unitary dual of <m> S p _ 4 ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> ? if so , can someone provide me any references ? how about other rank 2 real groups ? thank you !
let <m> G </m> be a semisimple lie algebra over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> . let <m> V ( \lambda ) </m> be the irreducible highest weight module for <m> G </m> with highest weight <m> \lambda </m> . if <m> G </m> is of type a , we can decompose <m> V ( \lambda ) \otimes V ( \mu ) </m> using littlewood-richardson rule . in other types , if <m> \lambda </m> and <m> \mu </m> are given explicitly , we can use weyl character formula to compute the decomposition . my question is can we have some rules similar as littlewood-richardson rule for other types -LRB- especially for type <m> G _ 2 </m> -RRB- ? does littelmann 's path model work for this ?
let <m> G </m> be a complex , connected , simply connected , semisimple group . i 'm trying to compare the following two spaces : the free loop space <m> L G </m> of <m> G </m> , and the <m> \mathbb C ( ( z ) ) </m> - valued points of <m> G </m> , <m> G ( \mathbb C ( ( z ) ) ) </m> , <m> L G = \{ f : S ^ 1 \to G : f \substack { \text { i s t h e r e s t r i c t i o n o f a } \, \text { h o l o m o r p h i c m a p } \mathbb C ^ \times \to G } \} . </m> <m> G ( \mathbb C ( ( z ) ) ) = \hom _ { \text { S c h } _ { \mathbb C } } ( \operatorname { S p e c } \mathbb C ( ( z ) ) , G ) . </m> in the way they are currently defined , they seem like they might be troublesome to work with , so let 's fix an embedding <m> G \hookrightarrow G L _ n ( \mathbb C ) </m> . the elements of <m> f \in L G </m> then look like functions with fourier series <m> f ( z ) = \sum _ { k = - \infty } ^ \infty A _ k z ^ k , \qquad A _ k \in M _ { n \times n } \mathbb C , \text { a n d } f ( z ) \in G \text { f o r a l l } z \in \mathbb C ^ \times ; \tag { 1 } </m> that is , there is an analytic convergence condition on the element <m> f ( z ) </m> .
let <m> K </m> be a field and let <m> Q </m> be a quaternion algebra over <m> K </m> . then it is well-known that the class <m> [ Q ] </m> of <m> Q </m> in <m> B r ( K ) </m> has order <m> 2 </m> . one can show this by constructing an explicit isomorphism <m> Q \otimes _ K Q \cong M _ 2 ( K ) </m> . my question is about the converse .
let <m> E ^ n </m> be the real or complex space of dimension <m> n </m> . if <m> N </m> and <m> M </m> are two norms over <m> E ^ n </m> , and if <m> A </m> is an endomorphism , then <m> \| A \| ^ M _ N : = \sup _ { x \ne 0 } \frac { M ( A x ) } { N ( x ) } </m> is an operator norm of <m> A </m> . the banach-mazur distance between <m> N </m> and <m> M </m> is <m> d ( N , M ) : = \log \inf _ { A \in A u t ( E ) } \| A \| ^ M _ N \| A ^ { - 1 } \| ^ N _ M . </m> it is actually a semi-distance , with <m> d ( N , M ) = 0 </m> iff one passes from <m> N </m> to <m> M </m> by a change of coordinates . thus <m> d </m> is a distance on some quotient space , in which there is only one euclidian norm , for instance . let us define the usual <m> \ell ^ p </m> - norm by <m> \| x \| _ p : = \left ( \sum _ j | x _ j | ^ p \right ) ^ { 1 / p } . </m> the <m> L ^ \infty </m> - norm is as usual . it has been known for a long time that if <m> 1 \le p , q \le 2 </m> , or if <m> 2 \le p , q \le \infty </m> , then <m> d ( \ell ^ p , \ell ^ q ) = \left | \frac { 1 } { p } - \frac { 1 } { q } \right | \log n . </m> what is known if <m> 1 \le p \le 2 \le q \le + \infty </m> ?
let <m> v \not = 1 </m> be a real number . let <m> f ( s ) </m> be real analytic on an open interval containing <m> v </m> and <m> 1 </m> , with a zero of order <m> m \ge 1 </m> at <m> s = 1 </m> . my question is : can we solve this functional equation with respect to <m> f </m> : <m> f ( s v ) = \frac { ( s - 1 ) f ' ( s ) } { f ( s ) } </m> where <m> s </m> is in the proximity of <m> s = 1 </m> .
let <m> \mathbb { T } ^ n </m> be the <m> n </m> - dimensional torus with coordinates <m> \mathbf { z } = ( z _ 1 , \dots , z _ n ) </m> -LRB- so that each <m> z _ i \in [ - \pi , \pi ) </m> is a coordinate on a one-dimensional circle -RRB- . for each <m> \mathbf { z } \in \mathbb { T } ^ n </m> , define <m> R ( \mathbf { z } ) </m> to be the set of pairwise distances between the coordinates <m> z _ i </m> , i.e. each <m> R ( \mathbf { z } ) </m> is a set of <m> n \choose 2 </m> numbers <m> d _ { i j } </m> with <m> d _ { i j } \in [ 0 , \pi ] </m> . define <m> \mathcal { M } ^ n </m> as <m> \mathbb { T } ^ n \setminus \sim </m> where <m> \mathbf { u } \sim \mathbf { v } </m> iff <m> R ( \mathbf { u } ) = R ( \mathbf { v } ) </m> -LRB- as unordered sets -RRB- . is <m> \mathcal { M } ^ n </m> some well-known object ? as a manifold , are there some `` nice '' coordinates on it ? -LRB- for <m> n = 2 </m> this is just the interval <m> [ 0 , \pi ] </m> but already for <m> n = 3 </m> it seems to be somewhat nontrivial -RRB- .
let <m> U </m> be the infinite unitary group <m> \lim _ { n \to \infty } U ( n ) </m> . it is well known that , over the rationals , <m> B U </m> is homotopy equivalent to <m> \prod _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty K ( \mathbb { Z } , 2 n ) </m> . question : is it true that , for any <m> k \geq 0 </m> , the homotopy group <m> \pi _ { 2 k + 1 } ( B U ( m ) ) </m> is 0 for <m> m </m> sufficiently large ?
let <m> f </m> be a modular form -LRB- cuspidal , new , eigenform -RRB- of weight <m> k </m> and level <m> N </m> . let <m> p </m> be a prime number not dividing <m> N </m> . in order to construct a <m> p </m> - adic <m> L </m> - function <m> L _ p ( f , s ) </m> interpolating the usual complex <m> L </m> - function , people choose a root <m> \alpha </m> of the polynomial <m> T ^ 2 - a _ p X + p ^ { k - 1 } = 0 </m> -LRB- <m> a _ p </m> being the <m> p </m> - th fourier coefficient -RRB- with the condition <m> v _ p ( \alpha ) < k - 1 </m> . q1 . why is this necessary for the construction ? q2 . what happens when none of the roots satisfy this condtion ? is it still possible to define a p-adic l-function ?
i expect this question has a very simple answer . we all know from primary school that there are no non-trivial continuous homomorphisms from <m> \hat { \mathbb { Z } } </m> to <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> . what if we forget continuity : can anybody give an explicit example of a homomorphism ? note that <m> \hat { \mathbb { Z } } </m> is torsion-free , and not divisible -LRB- since it 's isomorphic to <m> \prod _ p \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> and <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> is not divisible by <m> p </m> -RRB- . there is the canonical injection <m> \mathbb { Z } \to \hat { \mathbb { Z } } </m> ; is there some abstract reason why it ought to have a left inverse , and if so can we write it down ?
is it true that the singular locus of an irreducible hypersurface in <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 3 </m> have pure co-dimension ?
the title has it all . is there any consolidated terminology for referring to a -LRB- multiplicative -RRB- monoid <m> H </m> such that <m> x y \in H ^ \times </m> -LRB- if and -RRB- only if <m> x , y \in H ^ \times </m> ? here is a short list of monoids with this property :
let <m> n \in \mathbb { N } </m> and <m> n > 3 </m> . we let <m> L _ n </m> be the set of <m> 2 </m> - element subsets of <m> \{ 1 , \ldots , n \} </m> , that is <m> L _ n = \big \{ \{ a , b \} : a , b \in \{ 1 , \ldots , n \} \land a < b \big \} . </m> we say a map <m> c : L _ n \to \{ 1 , \ldots , n \} </m> is a coloring if <m> l _ 1 \neq l _ 2 \in L _ n </m> and <m> l _ 1 \cap l _ 2 \neq \emptyset </m> imply that <m> c ( l _ 1 ) \neq c ( l _ 2 ) </m> . it is not hard to prove that there is no coloring <m> c : L _ n \to \{ 1 , \ldots , n \} </m> such that <m> c ( l ) \in l </m> for all <m> l \in L _ n </m> . if <m> c </m> is a coloring , we call <m> l \in L _ n </m> exceptional if <m> c ( l ) \notin l </m> . what is the minimum number of exceptional members of <m> L _ n </m> that a coloring <m> c : L _ n \to \{ 1 , \ldots , n \} </m> can have , in terms of <m> n </m> ?
is it possible to find -LRB- necessary and sufficient -RRB- conditions on a general <m> n \times n </m> hermitian matrix <m> A </m> , such that its extremal eigenvectors -LRB- the eigenvectors corresponding to the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of <m> A </m> -RRB- have -LRB- pairwise -RRB- equal magnitude entries ? as an example , consider the case <m> n = 2 </m> . a basis in the space of <m> 2 \times 2 </m> hermitian matrices is given by the identity matrix <m> \mathbb I _ 2 </m> together with the three pauli matrices <m> \sigma _ 1 = \left ( \begin {array} { c c } 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end {array} \right ) \; , \qquad \sigma _ 2 = \left ( \begin {array} { c c } 0 & - i \\ i & 0 \end {array} \right ) \; , \qquad \sigma _ 3 = \left ( \begin {array} { c c } 1 & 0 \\ 0 & - 1 \end {array} \right ) \; . \qquad </m> the eigenvectors of the general <m> 2 \times 2 </m> hermitian matrix <m> A = \alpha \mathbb I _ 2 + \beta \sigma _ 1 + \gamma \sigma _ 2 + \delta \sigma _ 3 </m> -LRB- <m> \alpha , \beta , \gamma , \delta \in \mathbb R </m> -RRB- are <m> \left ( - \frac { \sqrt { \beta ^ 2 + \gamma ^ 2 + \delta ^ 2 } - \delta } { \beta + i \gamma } , \, 1 \right ) ^ T \; , \qquad \left ( \frac { \sqrt { \beta ^ 2 + \gamma ^ 2 + \delta ^ 2 } + \delta } { \beta + i \gamma } , \, 1 \right ) ^ T \; . </m> therefore , if <m> \delta = 0 </m> , then the extremal eigenvalues have the desired property . as an other example , consider the case <m> n = 3 </m> . a basis in the space of <m> 3 \times 3 </m> hermitian matrices is given by the identity matrix <m> \mathbb I _ 3 </m> together with the eight gell-mann matrices <m> \{ \lambda _ i \} _ { i = 1 , \dots , 8 } </m> . for instance , consider the subspace spanned by <m> \lambda _ 4 , \lambda _ 6 , \lambda _ 7 </m> , i.e. set <m> A = \alpha \lambda _ 4 + \beta \lambda _ 6 + \gamma \lambda _ 7 </m> . the extremal eigenvectors of <m> A </m> are <m> \left ( - \frac { \alpha } { \sqrt { \alpha ^ 2 + \beta ^ 2 + \gamma ^ 2 } } , - \frac { \beta - i \gamma } { \sqrt { \alpha ^ 2 + \beta ^ 2 + \gamma ^ 2 } } , \, 1 \right ) ^ T \; , \qquad \left ( \frac { \alpha } { \sqrt { \alpha ^ 2 + \beta ^ 2 + \gamma ^ 2 } } , \frac { \beta - i \gamma } { \sqrt { \alpha ^ 2 + \beta ^ 2 + \gamma ^ 2 } } , \, 1 \right ) ^ T \; . </m> the desired property holds in this case . however , i do n't know what is the maximal subspace on which it holds . in conclusion , the question asks for general conditions on a <m> n \times n </m> hermitian matrix <m> A </m> , for <m> n > 2 </m> , such that the extremal eigenvectors of <m> A </m> have equal magnitude entries .
please , help out of the mind trap . in this prominent paper kadison and ringrose prove among other things the following corollary 8 . each norm-continuous representation of a connected topological group by automorphisms of a <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra has range consisting of <m> \pi </m> - inner automorphisms . by <m> \pi </m> - inner these authors mean permanently weakly inner , see the definition on page 4 of the same paper , for instance . question : now suppose <m> A </m> is a commutative <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra , and let <m> \pi : A \to \mathcal { B } ( H ) </m> be a faithful <m> \star </m> - representation . a commutative <m> A </m> has obviously no non-trivial inner automorphisms . the strong/weak closure <m> \pi ( A ) ' ' \subset \mathcal { B } ( H ) </m> is also commutative , so <m> \pi ( A ) </m> can not have even non-trivial weakly inner automorphisms . by the above corollary this would mean that <m> A </m> has no norm-continuous group of automorphisms . but let <m> A = C [ 0 , 1 ] </m> for clarity -LRB- acting on <m> L ^ 2 [ 0 , 1 ] </m> -RRB- , and let <m> y ( x ; t ) = x ^ t </m> for all <m> x \in [ 0 , 1 ] </m> and <m> t \in ( 0 , \infty ) </m> . now <m> y ( . ; t ) </m> is a homeomorphism of <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> for every <m> t </m> , and therefore <m> \alpha _ t ( f ) = y _ * f = f [ x ^ t ] </m> is definitely <m> \| f \| _ { s u p } </m> - preserving automorphism of <m> C [ 0 , 1 ] </m> , thus <m> \| \alpha _ t \| _ { \mathrm { o p } } = 1 </m> . more generally , if <m> A \simeq C _ 0 ( M ) </m> by gelfand-naimark then every homeomorphism group <m> \phi _ t \in \mathrm { H o m e o } ( M ) </m> gives such an automorphism group <m> \alpha _ { \phi _ t } </m> . in fact , the particular <m> \alpha _ t </m> above is not even spatial . the map <m> U : L ^ 2 [ 0 , 1 ] \to L ^ 2 [ 0 , 1 ] </m> which gives <m> \alpha _ t ( f ) = U _ t f U _ t ^ { - 1 } </m> is also given by <m> U _ t [ h ] ( x ) = h ( x ^ t ) </m> for all <m> h \in L ^ 2 [ 0 , 1 ] </m> , and is not unitary , because lebesgue measure is not invariant under <m> y ( . ; t ) </m> . <m> U _ t </m> is even unbounded for <m> t > 1 </m> . so where does the source of confusion lie ? thank you .
let <m> a , b \in \mathbb { N } _ { \ge 2 } </m> be two integers that are multiplicatively independent -LRB- i.e. , are not powers of the same integer -RRB- . i have seen -LRB- bourgain , lindenstrauss , michel , venkatesh : some effective results for <m> \times a \, \times b </m> . ergodic th . dyn . syst . 29 -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- 2009 -RRB- 1705 -- 1722 -LSB- link to paper on venkatesh 's web page -RSB- -RRB- that , denoting by <m> X </m> the set of <m> \times a \, \times b </m> multiples of a fraction : <m> X = \left \{ a ^ k b ^ \ell \frac { m } { N } : 0 < k , \ell < \log N \right \} </m> these numbers are <m> \varepsilon </m> - dense in the reals : <m> \displaystyle d = \min _ { x \in X } | x - a | < \varepsilon </m> with <m> \varepsilon = \kappa \; ( \log \log \log N ) ^ { - \kappa ' } . </m> this does not seem terribly assuring as this number is tending to zero very very slowly . given that <m> \log N \approx \# \text { d i g i t s } ( N ) </m> , we 've got <m> \log \log \log N = \log \log \big [ \# \text { d i g i t s } ( N ) \big ] . </m> has this result improved much ? do we know anything about the constants <m> \kappa , \kappa ' </m> ?
as most of you already know , in model checking most linear-time properties are either safety properties or liveness properties . a linear time property is usually described with an <m> \omega </m> - regular language that tells exactly which traces satisfy the property . to check if a property is actually a safety property , one method would be to calculate the closure of the property and check whether its closure -LRB- as a set of infinite words -RRB- and the property itself -LRB- also as a set of infinite words -RRB- are equal . to calculate the closure it is important to calculate the set on finite prefixes of the <m> \omega </m> - regular language that describes the property .
as a warm-up in words : the sum of twelve uniform random variables is a classic approximation to a normal distribution . what is the joint pdf for the sum of their cubes and the sum of their fourth powers ? this is the <m> d = 1 2 </m> , <m> p = 3 </m> case of the asymptotic question that follows . let <m> f _ d = f _ { p ; d } </m> be the joint probability density function -LRB- pdf -RRB- of the pair <m> ( A , B ) </m> of random variables -LRB- r.v.

let <m> L </m> be a lagrangian submanifold of a closed symplectic manifold <m> X </m> . what i gather from costello -LRB- see specifically <m> \S </m> 2.5 there -RRB- , is that one expects to have a morphism of closed tcft 's <m> \tag { 1 } \Phi \to \Psi </m> where <m> \Phi </m> is a closed tcft derived from the unital cy <m> A _ \infty </m> algebra <m> \mathcal A </m> of <m> L </m> . it sends the generator object to the reduced hochschild chain complex of <m> \mathcal A </m> , <m> \Phi ( 1 ) = \underline { C C } _ * \mathcal A </m> . <m> \Psi </m> is the closed tcft derived from gromov-witten theory of <m> X </m> , <m> \Psi ( 1 ) = C _ * ( X ) </m> . -LRB- <m> \ref { m a p } </m> -RRB- means that for every pair of non-negative integers <m> a , b </m> there should be a -LRB- strictly commutative -RRB- square of chain maps <m> \require { A M S c d } </m> <m> \tag { 2 } \mathcal M ( b , a ) \otimes \Phi ( a ) @ > > > \Phi ( b ) \, @ V V V @ V V V \, \mathcal M ( b , a ) \otimes \Psi ( a ) @ > > > \Psi ( b ) </m> where <m> \mathcal M ( b , a ) </m> is a certain chain model for the hom-spaces in segal 's category . on the other hand , for the case of the coproduct , which corresponds to the point class <m> [ p t ] </m> in the pair of pants moduli , <m> [ p t ] \in H ( \mathcal M ( 2 , 1 ) ) </m> , sheridan -LRB- see in particular figure 2 there -RRB- constructs a certain subset <m> \mathcal C </m> of the moduli spaces of disks with two interior markings and any number of boundary markings which seems to be a homotopy `` filling in '' the square <m> \mathcal \Phi ( 1 ) @ > > > \Phi ( 2 ) \, @ V V V @ V V V \, \mathcal \Psi ( 1 ) @ > > > \Psi ( 2 ) </m> more precisely , sheridan uses <m> \partial \mathcal C </m> to prove that the dual , closed-open map is a map of algebras -LRB- after taking homology -RRB- , but it seems that the same <m> \mathcal C </m> can also be interpreted as a homotopy for the square above . is there a recipe for generalizing the construction of the subset <m> \mathcal C </m> , to demonstrate the commutativity of other squares obtained from -LRB- <m> \ref { s q u a r e } </m> -RRB- ? i 'd be content with a heuristic argument , that would at least help to see the construction of <m> \mathcal C </m> as derived naturally from general geometric considerations , or even just a few other examples of what <m> \mathcal C </m> should be replaced with for other classes in <m> H ( \mathcal M ( b , a ) ) </m> .
a subset a of a compact metric m is called a <m> \epsilon </m> net if it satisfies the following conditions -LRB- 1 -RRB- <m> \epsilon </m> dense : the neighborhood of a is the entire m -LRB- 2 -RRB- <m> \epsilon </m> separate : <m> \forall x , y \in A </m> , <m> d ( x , y ) > \epsilon </m> it is a well known fact that for any <m> \epsilon </m> , there is a fintie <m> \epsilon </m> net . and i wonder whether there is an uniform bound for cardinalities of all the <m> \epsilon </m> - nets of a given compact metric space -LRB- fixed <m> \epsilon </m> -RRB- . may be exist a comapcat metric space , just constructing one , who have a series of <m> \epsilon </m> net and the cardinality of these series of <m> \epsilon </m> net are unbounded . i think the question is negative and should involve the hausdorff measure , dimenson and volume , but now i am confused . it will be so nice for some people to give me a answer .
the oeis sequence oeis.org/a108380 gives the least number of distinct n-th roots of unity summing to the smallest possible nonzero magnitude . this sequence seems to imply that the least number of distinct <m> n - </m> th roots of unity summing to the smallest possible nonzero magnitude is growing with something like linear growth with <m> n . </m> i have asked about fourier coefficients of characteristic functions of sets with a geometric series structure , that is sets of the form <m> \{ 1 , 2 , \ldots , 2 ^ { s - 1 } \} </m> with <m> n \geq 2 ^ { s - 1 } </m> implying <m> s = O ( \log n ) , </m> see the link below . answering the question in the title would provide a lower bound to the linked question when <m> n </m> is a prime . lower bound on geometric series structured sets ' fourier coefficients related more general question : how small can a sum of a few roots of unity be ?
let <m> f = \frac { 1 } { | x | } , x \in \mathbb { R ^ 3 } </m> and <m> \Omega = [ - b , b ] ^ 3 </m> . how to construct a quadrature scheme to solve <m> \int _ \Omega f \phi \psi d x \quad ? </m> where <m> \phi \psi </m> is smooth function . i know there exists a transformation called duffy transformation which can eliminate the singularity at <m> x = 0 </m> by using the jacobian . indeed , let <m> \begin {aligned} T & = \{ ( x _ 1 , x _ 2 , x _ 3 ) ; 0 \leq x _ 1 \leq 1 , 0 \leq x _ 2 \leq x _ 1 , 0 \leq x _ 3 \leq x _ 1 \} \\ \hat { T } & = \{ ( \hat { x } _ 1 , \hat { x } _ 2 , \hat { x } _ 3 ) ; 0 \leq \hat { x } _ 1 \leq 1 , 0 \leq \hat { x _ 2 } \leq 1 , 0 \leq \hat { x _ 3 } \leq 1 \} \end {aligned} </m> define <m> F : \hat { T } \rightarrow T </m> as <m> F ( \hat { x } _ 1 , \hat { x } _ 2 , \hat { x } _ 3 ) = ( \hat { x } _ 1 , \hat { x } _ 1 \hat { x } _ 2 , \hat { x } _ 1 \hat { x } _ 3 ) </m> then <m>  </m> which can be solved by usual quadrature scheme . on the other hand , someone can also avoid the singularity by omitting a <m> \varepsilon </m> cube which contains the origin . however , these are not enough for me when i want to study the convergence rate of numerical integration on <m> \Omega </m> . i hope the error can be bounded by <m> O ( h ) \Vert \phi \Vert _ { 1 , 2 , \Omega } \Vert \psi \Vert _ { 1 , 2 , \Omega } </m> is there any other way to integrate a <m> L ^ 2 </m> function or a function with singularity at vertex directly with the error bounded by <m> L ^ 2 </m> norm ? thank you very much .
i was watching dick gross 's laudation for manjul bhargava , followed up by one of bhargava 's talks , and i realized i was confused about something . bhargava says -LRB- around 21 minutes -RRB- that the orbits of <m> S L _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> on binary cubic forms , meaning cubic forms of the sort <m> a x ^ 3 + b x ^ 2 y + c x y ^ 2 + d y ^ 3 </m> with <m> a </m> , <m> b </m> , <m> c </m> , <m> d \in \mathbb { Z } </m> , correspond to orders in cubic number fields . a bit later -LRB- 36 minutes -RRB- , he says that orbits of <m> S L _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> on cubic forms where <m> 3 </m> divides <m> b </m> and <m> c </m> correspond to a pair of quadratic field <m> K </m> and ideal class of <m> K </m> with cube equal to <m> 1 </m> . so , up to this issue of divisibility by <m> 3 </m> , orders in cubic fields are ideal classes with cube <m> 1 </m> in quadratic fields . but i also know class field theory : given a quadratic field <m> K </m> , and a character <m> \mathrm { C l a s s } ( K ) \to \mathbb { Z } / 3 \mathbb { Z } </m> , i get an unramified cubic extension of <m> K </m> . so , here is where i am confused :
is there any reference where i can find the character table of the symmetric group <m> S _ 7 </m> ? a simple search in google gave me a gap program that computes the character table , but i do n't understand the table that the program produces , since it does not tell me each column in the table is associated to which conjugacy class . i would like to have a table like enter link description here i would be extremely thankful if you provide me reference .
as it is more or less well-know , and as it has come up on mo a couple of times , the <m> \mathbb R </m> - algebra <m> C ^ \infty ( M ) </m> of smooth functions on a -LRB- say -RRB- compact manifold contains essentially everything there is to know about <m> M </m> itself .
let <m> \mathbb A ^ n </m> be the n-dimensional affine space over a field k -LRB- algebraically closed if that makes it easier -RRB- , so <m> \mathbb A ^ n = \text { S p e c } K [ x _ 1 , . . . , x _ n ] </m> , and <m> \mathbb A ^ { n - 1 } </m> the -LRB- n-1 -RRB- - dimensional analog . the inclusion <m> K [ x _ 1 , . . . , x _ { n - 1 } ] \to K [ x _ 1 , . . . , x _ n ] </m> induces a map <m> \mathbb A ^ n \to \mathbb A ^ { n - 1 } </m> . is this a projective map ?
this question is a cross-post from mse , cause i did n't get any answer there . i hope it is well suited for mo : let <m> ( x _ { n } ) _ { n \ge 1 } </m> be an increasing sequence of positive integers and <m> \displaystyle { \overline { x } _ { n } : = \dfrac { 1 } { n } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } x _ { i } } </m> . suppose furthermore that <m> \forall \varepsilon \gt 0 , \ \ n . \overline { x } _ { n } \ll _ { \varepsilon } n ^ { 1 + \varepsilon } </m> . does it entail that <m> x _ { n } \ll \overline { x } _ { n } ^ { 2 } </m> ? thanks in advance . edit : i think i must clear up my idea here . writing <m> m _ { n } : = \dfrac { x _ { 1 } + x _ { n } } { 2 } </m> and using the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means , one gets <m> x _ { 1 } . x _ { n } \le m _ { n } ^ { 2 } </m> . my idea is that , under the growth condition above , <m> m _ { n } </m> is roughly of the same order of magnitude as <m> \overline { x } _ { n } </m> .
let <m> g </m> be a lie algebra , say <m> s l _ n ( \mathbb C ) </m> . it is considered as the adjoint representation of <m> G = S L _ n ( \mathbb C ) </m> . a famous theorem of kostant from `` lie group representations on polynomial rings '' states that <m> S = I \otimes H , </m> where <m> S ( g ) = \oplus _ { m = 0 } ^ \infty \vee ^ m { g } </m> is a graded algebra of the symmetric powers of the adjoint representation <m> g </m> , <m> H </m> is <m> G </m> - harmonic part , and <m> I </m> is <m> G </m> - invariant part . i would like to see a formula for <m> I </m> , or the -LRB- degree of -RRB- generators of <m> I </m> . is it true <m> I = \prod _ { i = 2 } ^ n ( 1 - q ^ { i } ) ^ { - 1 } </m> ? <m> q </m> is the symbol for recording the grading .
is `` zf + <m> \omega _ 1 </m> is supercompact '' consistent relative to `` zfc + there is a supercompact cardinal '' ? in particular , if <m> \delta </m> is supercompact , does it remain so in <m> V ( \mathbb { R } \cap V [ G ] ) </m> where <m> G \subset C o l ( \omega , < \delta ) </m> is <m> V </m> - generic ? this seems to be the case for measurability but i am having trouble proving it for supercompactness . it seems likely that someone else has tried this , so i though i 'd ask here . the appropriate definition of supercompactness in zf is the one in terms of normal fine measures , where normality is defined using diagonal intersections . i am aware that <m> \omega _ 1 </m> has some amount of supercompactness under ad . i am interested in a more direct proof using forcing , which i hope will give -LRB- full -RRB- supercompactness .
let <m> \mu ( n ) </m> denote the möbius function and <m> \varphi ( n ) </m> the euler-phi function . what is known about <m> f ( x ) = \sum _ { n \leq x } \mu ( n ) \varphi ( n ) </m> ? for example :
assume <m> \kappa </m> is uncountable and <m> \phi </m> is an <m> L _ { \infty , \kappa } </m> sentence . let <m> K </m> be the collection of models of <m> \phi </m> partially ordered by <m> \prec _ { \infty , \kappa } </m> . it is well-known that <m> K </m> is closed under unions of increasing chains of length <m> \kappa ^ + </m> , but the argument fails for increasing chains of length <m> < \kappa </m> . do you have an easy counterexample , either for <m> \kappa = \aleph _ 1 </m> or <m> \kappa = \aleph _ \omega </m> ?

let us consider the convolution <m> f \left ( x \right ) : = \int _ { 2 } ^ { x - 2 } \sum _ { \rho _ { 1 } } \frac { u ^ { \rho _ { 1 } } } { \rho _ { 1 } } \sum _ { \rho _ { 2 } } \frac { \left ( x - u \right ) ^ { \rho _ { 2 } } } { \rho _ { 2 } } d u , \, x > 4 </m> where <m> \rho _ { i } , \, i = 1 , 2 </m> runs over the non-trivial zeros of <m> \zeta \left ( s \right ) </m> . it is possible to observe that <m> f \left ( x \right ) </m> is a continuous and piecewise smooth function . for a work i need to evaluate <m> \frac { d } { d x } f \left ( x \right ) = \frac { d } { d x } \left ( \int _ { 2 } ^ { x - 2 } \sum _ { \rho _ { 1 } } \frac { u ^ { \rho _ { 1 } } } { \rho _ { 1 } } \sum _ { \rho _ { 2 } } \frac { \left ( x - u \right ) ^ { \rho _ { 2 } } } { \rho _ { 2 } } d u \right ) \tag { 1 } </m> obviously where it makes sense . my question is :
a riemannian manifold <m> ( M , g ) </m> is called <m> \alpha - </m> einstein if there exist a non-zero <m> 1 - </m> form <m> \alpha </m> such <m> \rho = a g + b \alpha \otimes \alpha </m> where <m> a , b </m> are smooth functions on <m> M </m> and <m> \rho </m> is ricci tensor of <m> g </m> . it is easy to see that if <m> b = 0 </m> then <m> ( M , g ) </m> reduce to einstein manifold . q1 : is there a similar version of the following known theorem such that we deduce <m> ( M , g ) </m> is a <m> \alpha - </m> einstein :

a word -LRB- i.e. , ordered string of letters -RRB- is bifix-free provided it has no proper initial string and terminal string that are identical . for example , the word <m> i n g r a t i a t i n g </m> has bifix <m> i n g </m> , but the word <m> i n g r a t i a t e </m> is bifix-free . let <m> a _ n ^ { ( q ) } </m> be the number of bifix-free words over a fixed <m> q </m> - letter alphabet . the generating function <m> f ( x ) = f ^ { ( q ) } ( x ) = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } a _ n x ^ n </m> satisfies the functional equation <m> f ( x ) = q x + q x f ( x ) - f ( x ^ 2 ) . </m> solving for <m> f ( x ) </m> gives <m> f ( x ) = \frac { q x - f ( x ^ 2 ) } { 1 - q x } = \cdots = \sum _ { j = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { ( - 1 ) ^ j q x ^ { 2 ^ j } } { \prod _ { k = 0 } ^ { j } ( 1 - q x ^ { 2 ^ k } ) } . </m> -LRB- q1 -RRB- is there a `` nice '' solution to this functional equation , perhaps one that does not involve an infinite product or sum ? here is a plot of <m> f ^ { ( 2 ) } ( x ) </m> generated in sage :

there are different criteria for building a model <m> V </m> of <m> Z F C </m> which is far from its <m> H O D </m> , for example : <m> ( A ) </m> cardinality criteria : for this in a joint work with james cummings and sy friedman , we produced a model <m> V </m> in which for all infinite cardinals <m> \alpha </m> we have <m> \alpha ^ + > ( \alpha ^ + ) ^ { H O D } . </m> <m> ( B ) </m> having large cardinals : the idea is to build models which contain some very large cardinals but such that their <m> H O D </m> does not contain them . for this see the nice paper large cardinals need not be large in hod by yong cheng , sy friedman and hamkins . <m> ( C ) </m> the continuum function criteria : to idea is to build models in which <m> 2 ^ \kappa </m> is large in <m> V </m> but is small in <m> H O D </m> -LRB- for this i recently showed that we can have a model in which <m> G C H </m> fails everywhere but its <m> H O D </m> satisfies the <m> G C H </m> -RRB- . <m> ( D ) </m> the cofinality criteria : to build models which contain many singular cardinals which are regular in <m> H O D </m> . for this see for example shoshana friedman 's talk given at the 5th european set theory conference -LRB- 5estc -RRB- .
lets say , <m> A \in \mathbb { R } ^ { m \times n } </m> , and <m> D \in \mathbb { R } ^ { m \times m } </m> , where <m> D </m> is a diagonal matrix with positive diagonal elements , and all the elements are <m> \le 1 </m> . for simplicity , assume that <m> A ^ T A </m> is positive definite . it is easy to see that <m> \lambda _ { \max } ( A ^ T D A ) \le \lambda _ { \max } ( A ^ T A ) \cdot \max _ { i } D _ { i i } , \, \lambda _ { \min } ( A ^ T D A ) \ge \lambda _ { \min } ( A ^ T A ) \cdot \min _ { i } D _ { i i } </m> however , are these bounds generally tight ? for example , if <m> D </m> is such that one of its elements is <m> 1 </m> , and all others are equal to some small number <m> \epsilon </m> , then does the lower bound on the least eigenvalue produce a sever underestimation of the lowest eigenvalue of <m> A ^ T D A </m> . specifically ,

according to bryant 's work on special holonomy groups , <m> G _ 2 \subset S O ( 7 ) </m> may be defined as the group preserving the following 3-form : <m> \phi _ 0 = \mathrm { d } x _ { 1 2 3 } + \mathrm { d } x _ { 1 4 5 } + \mathrm { d } x _ { 1 6 7 } + \mathrm { d } x _ { 2 4 6 } - \mathrm { d } x _ { 2 5 7 } - \mathrm { d } x _ { 3 4 7 } - \mathrm { d } x _ { 3 5 6 } </m> where <m> \mathrm { d } x _ { i j k } = \mathrm { d } x _ i \wedge \mathrm { d } x _ j \wedge \mathrm { d } x _ k </m> . in a similar fashion , <m> S p i n ( 7 ) \subset S O ( 8 ) </m> may be defined as the group preserving the following 4-form : <m> \Omega _ 0 = \mathrm { d } x _ { 1 2 3 4 } + \mathrm { d } x _ { 1 2 5 6 } + \mathrm { d } x _ { 1 2 7 8 } + \mathrm { d } x _ { 1 3 5 7 } - \mathrm { d } x _ { 1 3 6 8 } - \mathrm { d } x _ { 1 4 5 8 } - \mathrm { d } x _ { 1 4 6 7 } - \mathrm { d } x _ { 2 3 5 8 } - \mathrm { d } x _ { 2 3 6 7 } - \mathrm { d } x _ { 2 4 5 7 } + \mathrm { d } x _ { 2 4 6 8 } + \mathrm { d } x _ { 3 4 5 6 } + \mathrm { d } x _ { 3 4 7 8 } + \mathrm { d } x _ { 5 6 7 8 } </m> but of course , with this definition , it is not obvious at all that <m> S p i n ( 7 ) </m> is really a double cover of <m> S O ( 7 ) </m> . is there any way to understand this fact ? -LRB- that is , which is the point of defining <m> \Omega _ 0 </m> like this ? -RRB- in the book on quaternions and octonions there is a definition of <m> S p i n ( 7 ) \subset S O ( 8 ) </m> related to ` octonions automorphisms ' -LRB- they are not really automorphisms -RRB- which reveals some of this double-cover nature . perhaps these could be a bridge linking these two sides , but at this moment it is not clear for me . any suggestion will be welcomed .
i am studying a paper that uses the following property : consider <m> U </m> and <m> V </m> open , bounded and convex domains in <m> R ^ n </m> with <m> U \supset \overline { V } </m> and suppose that <m> m i n _ { y \in V } | x - y | = \lambda > 0 </m> -LRB- <m> \lambda </m> is independent of <m> x </m> -RRB- for all <m> x \in \partial U </m> . then the <m> \partial U </m> is <m> C ^ { 1 , 1 } </m> from inside . the authors doens ' t say a reference for this . i searched a lot for a reference for this property , but i did n't find anything ... someone could point me a reference -LRB- or give a proof -RRB- ? thanks for your attention observation : a time ago i asked a similar question -LRB- and maybe help : mathoverflow.net/q/184713/55893 -RRB- , but i dont see how to use to proof in the case <m> C ^ { 1 , 1 } </m>
what is the consistency strength of existence of a nontrivial elementary embedding <m> j : L _ L _ </m> for some ordinal <m>  </m> ? the consistency strength is strictly between totally ineffable and <m>  </m> - erdős cardinals , but i do not know where it should be placed relative to completely ineffable , 1-iterable , remarkable , 2-iterable , <m> n </m> - iterable cardinals -LRB- <m> n < </m> -RRB- . the least such <m>  </m> is also the least such that there is <m> S </m> with <m> | S | = </m> and <m> S </m> being indiscernibles for <m> L _ </m> . -LRB- the latter formulation makes it a deceptively weak-looking statement . -RRB- moreover , we can pick <m> S </m> such that <m> S </m> are good indiscernibles and also that every element of <m> L _ </m> is definable in <m> L _ </m> from a finite subset of <m> S </m> . <m> L _ </m> will satisfy zfc with every <m> S </m> -LRB- if we used good indiscernibles -RRB- totally ineffable and <m> L _ L _ </m> . a theory with slightly weaker consistency strength , using language <m> ( V , , j ) </m> , is zfc + <m> j </m> is a nontrivial elementary elementary embedding <m> V V </m> , with transfinite induction -LRB- least ordinal principle -RRB- , but without separation and replacement for formulas involving <m> j </m> . -LRB- this avoids kunen 's inconsistency ; see for example the spectrum of elementrary embeddings j : v → v by paul corazza . -RRB- i am also curious about the strength of that theory . ramsey-like cardinals and ramsey-like cardinals ii would suggest that the strength is above <m> n </m> - iterable . if that is correct , then for <m> n < </m> , existence of <m>  </m> and <m>  </m> with a nontrivial elementary embedding <m> j : L _ L _ </m> with <m> j ^ n ( \mathrm { c r i t } ( j ) ) < </m> is likely interleaved in <m> ^ 1 _ 2 </m> strength between <m> n - 1 </m> - iterable and <m> n </m> - iterable cardinals -LRB- if i am not off by 1 -RRB- . however , none of this is explicitly stated , and i do not know if i am missing some assumptions .
consider the following for <m> n \geq 1 </m> : <m> S _ n = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n i ^ { \ln ( i ) } </m> it seems to be hard to give an exact closed form formula for <m> S _ n </m> . it is straightforward however to see that <m> n ^ { \ln ( n ) } \leq S _ n \leq n ^ { \ln ( n ) + 1 } </m> but it is not clear to me if <m> S _ n </m> is asymptotic to some constant times the lower or upper bound or some function in between .
in the paper , p erdos , r graham , i ruzsa , e straus , on the prime factors of <m> \binom { 2 n } n </m> , math . comp. , 29:83 -- 92 , 1975 , it was conjectured that the central binomials are never square-free for <m> n > 4 </m> . the proof was given in a granville , o ramare , explicit bounds on exponential sums and the scarcity of squarefree binomial coefficients , mathematika , 43:73 -- 107 , 1996 . cute fact : <m> \frac 1 2 \binom { 2 n } n \in \mathbb { Z } </m> , and it is odd iff <m> n = 2 ^ k </m> . so , remove powers of <m> 2 </m> to write <m> \frac 1 { 2 ^ n } \binom { 2 n } n : = \frac { U _ n } { V _ n } </m> as reduced fractions , and ask :
let <m> \Delta _ n : = \{ x \in \mathbb { R } ^ n | x \ge 0 , \sum _ { 1 \le i \le n } x _ i = 1 \} </m> be the <m> n </m> - simplex . for <m> a , b \in \mathbb R ^ n </m> , with <m> \Delta _ n \not \ni a </m> , consider the problem of computing the following value exactly <m> \alpha : = \min _ { x \in \Delta _ n } \| x - a \| + \langle b , x \rangle . </m> the case when <m> b = 0 </m> corresponds to the problem of projecting the point <m> a </m> unto <m> \Delta _ n </m> . this special case is well-known to be exactly solvable in <m> \mathcal { O } ( n ) </m> flops . now , for the general problem , it 's not hard to rewrite <m>  </m> question : given <m> c \in \mathbb R ^ n </m> -LRB- <m> c _ i \equiv b _ i - t </m> -RRB- , can one compute the value of <m> \min _ { \| y \| ^ 2 \le 1 , \; y \le c } - \langle a , y \rangle </m> analytically ? for which values of <m> c </m> does the latter problem have a solution ? no polynomial time algorithm for exact solution ? observation : in low dimensional cases -LRB- <m> n = 1 , 2 , 3 </m> -RRB- , when non-degenerate , it 's not hard to sketch that this problem has solutions which are piece-wise polynomials -LRB- or square roots of such -RRB- in the <m> a _ i </m> 's and <m> c _ i </m> 's , the number of pieces being in the order of <m> 2 ^ n </m> .
i was trying to understand this interesting question by example . let me follow their previous discussion and ask : let a generic nontrivial 2-cocycle <m> \omega _ 2 ^ G ( g _ 1 , g _ 2 ) \in H ^ 2 ( G , \mathbb { R } / \mathbb { Z } ) </m> in the cohomology group of <m> G </m> with <m> U ( 1 ) = \mathbb { R } / \mathbb { Z } </m> coefficient . in otherwords , here the 2-cocycle <m> \omega _ 2 ^ G </m> is a complex <m> U ( 1 ) = \mathbb { R } / \mathbb { Z } </m> function with the norm <m> | \omega _ 2 ^ G | = 1 </m> but with a <m> U ( 1 ) </m> complex phase satisfying the cocycle condition . i like to ask how can we trivialize the 2-cocycle <m> \omega _ 2 ( g _ 1 , g _ 2 ) </m> of <m> G </m> into 2-coboundary if we lift <m> G </m> into a larger group <m> J </m> , and given that we know the group homomorphism <m> r </m> : <m> J \overset { r } { \rightarrow } G . </m> in particular i like to focus on :
i am considering several examples of compact complex threefolds <m> X </m> such that <m> r k H ^ 2 ( X ) = 3 </m> . note that we have a cubic form on <m> H ^ 2 ( X , \mathbb Q ) </m> which comes from the cup product . i calculated the aronhold s-invariants for those cubic forms and found that they are all zero , which is very curious to me . so let me ask some questions : if s-invariants for a ternary cubic form is zero , what does it mean to the cubic form ? is it a general phenomenon that s-invariants for cubic forms on such <m> X </m> 's are zero ? if it not , what does zero s-invariant possibly mean to <m> X </m> ?
i would like to find the irreducible characters of the group <m> E _ 8 ( 5 ) </m> -LRB- mod 2 -RRB- ? can anyone help ? -LRB- i am elementary in working with brauer characters -RRB- many thanks
i am trying to argue that exterior measure has nice properties that jordan outer measure does n't have . one of them is finite additivity , but i ca n't find a simple way to show jordan outer measure is not finitely additive on positively separated sets in <m> \mathbb { R ^ n } </m> ? can someone give me a simple proof or a counter example ?
let <m> A </m> be an associative unital <m> k </m> - algebra , and let <m> M </m> be a bimodule of <m> A </m> . the hochschild cohomology of <m> A </m> with coefficients in <m> M </m> can be defined as <m> H H ^ { n } ( A , \, M ) = \mathrm { E x t } ^ { n } _ { A ^ { e } } ( A , \, M ) </m> where <m> A ^ { e } </m> is the enveloping algebra of <m> A </m> . since both <m> A </m> and its <m> k </m> - linear dual <m> A ^ { * } </m> are <m> A </m> - bimodules , we have two cohomology theories <m> H H ^ { \bullet } ( A , \, A ) </m> and <m> H H ^ { \bullet } ( A , \, A ^ { * } ) </m> . most of papers i saw call <m> H H ^ { \bullet } ( A , \, A ) </m> the hochschild cohomology of <m> A </m> and denote it by <m> H H ^ { \bullet } ( A ) </m> . however , in loday 's book , he used <m> H H ^ { \bullet } ( A ) </m> to denote <m> H H ^ { \bullet } ( A , \, A ^ { * } ) </m> . so it seems like that we have two different definitions of <m> H H ^ { \bullet } ( A ) </m> , the hochschild cohomology of <m> A </m> . and these two definitions have their own advantages . for example , <m> H H ^ { \bullet } ( A , \, A ) </m> is a gerstenhaber algebra and even a batalin-vilkovisky algebra for some algebra <m> A </m> . moreover , if <m> A </m> is smooth , we can relate <m> H H ^ { \bullet } ( A , \, A ) </m> to the polyvector ﬁelds as the dual of differential forms . on the other hand , <m> H H ^ { \bullet } ( A , \, A ^ { * } ) </m> is a contravariant functor from the category of <m> k </m> - algebras to the category of <m> k </m> - vector spaces . this definition of <m> H H ^ { \bullet } ( A ) </m> is also related to the cyclic cohomology <m> H C ^ { \bullet } ( A ) </m> of <m> A </m> , and we have the long exact sequence <m> \longrightarrow H C ^ { n - 2 } ( A ) \longrightarrow H C ^ { n } ( A ) \longrightarrow H H ^ { n } ( A ) \longrightarrow </m> of hochschild cohomology and cyclic cohomology . i want to know that which definition of <m> H H ^ { \bullet } ( A ) </m> is more popular and has more significant results in research . are they defined from different points of view ? thanks a lot .
let <m> X </m> be a smooth algebraic -LRB- / projective if it simplifies things considerably -RRB- variety over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> and consider the derived category <m> \mathcal { C } = D _ h ^ b ( \mathcal { D } _ X ) </m> of bounded complexes of <m> \mathcal { D } _ X </m> - modules with holonomic cohomology . the category <m> \mathcal { C } </m> is triangulated -LRB- / stable <m> \infty </m> - -RRB- symmetric monoidal and so it makes sense to ask about its prime spectrum -LRB- the collection of all prime ideal thick subcategories -RRB- .
my question is about the proof of theorem <m> 3 . 1 . 3 </m> given in kubota 's book , which shows how the function <m> \varphi ( s ) </m> appearing in the fourier expansion of eisenstein series can be continued holomorphically to the region determined by <m> R e ( s ) > 1 / 2 , </m> and <m> s \notin ] 1 / 2 ; 1 ] </m> . so , how the formula <m> ( \theta , \bar { \theta _ { \zeta } } ) = \frac { 1 } { 2 \pi i } \int _ { R e ( s ) = S _ { 0 } } \frac { h ( 1 - s ) h ( s ) + h ( s ) ^ { 2 } \varphi ( s ) } { ( s - \zeta ) ( s - ( 1 - \zeta ) ) } d s </m> where <m> R e ( 1 - \zeta ) < S _ { 0 } < R e ( \zeta ) </m> , <m> S _ { 0 } > 1 </m> gives the formula <m> ( \theta , \bar { \theta _ { \zeta } } ) = \frac { 1 } { 2 \pi i } \int _ { R e ( s ) = S _ { 1 } } \frac { h ( 1 - s ) h ( s ) + h ( s ) ^ { 2 } \varphi ( s ) } { ( s - \zeta ) ( s - ( 1 - \zeta ) ) } d s - \frac { ( h ( 1 - \zeta ) h ( \zeta ) + h ( \zeta ) ^ { 2 } \varphi ( \zeta ) ) } { 2 \zeta - 1 } </m> where <m> S _ 1 </m> is any real number satisfying <m> R e ( \zeta ) < S _ 1 </m> . it is not clear for me how kubota deduces the second formula from the first one -LRB- theorem 3.1.1 -RRB- ! thank you .
let <m> G </m> be a finite abelian <m> p </m> - group , <m> p </m> a prime . i say that a pair <m> ( G ' , \varphi ) </m> is a maximal cyclic quotient -LRB- please excuse me if this definition already exists and refers to a different concept -RRB- of <m> G </m> if <m> G ' </m> is a cyclic group and <m> \varphi \colon G \to G ' </m> is a surjective map with the following property : if <m> H \leq \ker \varphi </m> is a subgroup such that <m> G / H </m> is cyclic , then <m> H = \ker \varphi </m> . my first question is the following : is it true that if <m> ( G ' , \varphi ) </m> is a maximal cyclic quotient of <m> G </m> then <m> G \simeq G ' \times \ker \varphi </m> ? let now <m> G = \prod _ i G _ i </m> be the decomposition of <m> G </m> into cyclic <m> p </m> - groups and let <m> H </m> be a subgroup of <m> G </m> . does there exist an automorphism of <m> G </m> which maps <m> H </m> to a product <m> \prod _ i H _ i </m> with <m> H _ i \leq G _ i </m> for all <m> i </m> ? an affirmative answer to this question would imply an affirmative answer to the first one , but i have no clue about its truth ; it sounds as a pretty strong statement indeed ...

i 'm trying to get an understanding of hilbert <m> C ^ * </m> - bi-modules from a geometric point of view . as is well-known , we have that i -RRB- commutative unital <m> C ^ * </m> - algebras correspond to compact hausdorff spaces through the gelfand -- naimark theorem and the identification <m> X \mapsto C ( X ) </m> . ii -RRB- in this setting , hermtian vector bundles are generalized as hilbert <m> C ^ * </m> - modules . does the notion of a hilbert <m> C ^ * </m> - bimodule , over a pair of <m> C ^ * </m> - algebras <m> ( A , B ) </m> , have a corresponding geometric interpretation in the classical case ? my guess , since we are now dealing with two <m> C ^ * </m> - algebras , there must a second space whose functions can multiply the sections of the bundle . the only way i can think of doing this is if the new space is simply a subspace of the first . but this does n't feel like the `` correct picture '' here .

this question is motivated by question enumerating representations of an integer as a sum of squares . consider a prime number <m> p </m> congruent to <m> 7 </m> modulo <m> 8 </m> . it can thus be written in exactly <m> ( p + 1 ) / 2 </m> ways as a sum of squares of four strictly positive integers . one way of trying to generate all solutions of <m> p = a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 + c ^ 2 + d ^ 2 </m> with <m> ( a , b , c , d ) \in \mathbb N ^ 4 </m> is to start with an arbitrary solution -LRB- obtained eg by crystal-ball gazing -RRB- <m> ( a , b , c , d ) </m> , to fix one of the parameters , say <m> a </m> , and to decompose <m> b ^ 2 + c ^ 2 + d ^ 2 </m> differently as a sum of three squares , if possible . this works seemingly always . otherwise stated , associate to a prime <m> p \equiv 7 \pmod 8 </m> a graph with <m> ( p + 1 ) / 2 </m> vertices indexed by all different decompositions <m> p = a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 + c ^ 2 + d ^ 2 </m> with <m> a , b , c , d \in \mathbb N </m> and draw an edge between two vertices <m> ( a , b , c , d ) , ( a ' , b ' , c ' , d ' ) </m> if the intersection of <m> \lbrace a , b , c , d \rbrace </m> and <m> \lbrace a ' , b ' , c ' , d ' \rbrace </m> is non-empty . is this graph is always connected ? if yes , what is typically the diameter of this graph ?
we work on a polish group <m> G </m> and consider finite signed measures . let <m> \theta _ x \mu ( B ) : = \mu ( x ^ { - 1 } B ) </m> . fix a <m> \mu </m> . it is clear that <m> x \mapsto \theta _ x \mu </m> is continuous when the codomain is given the weak * topology when identified with a subset of <m> C _ b ( G ) ^ * </m> . -LRB- this would be called convergence in distribution if we were working only with probability measures -RRB- . is it known whether <m> x \mapsto \theta _ x \mu </m> is borel measurable with the topology generated by the total variation norm on the codomain ?
while trying to prove the inequality <m> c _ { p _ n - m } + c _ { m - n } > p _ n + 2 </m> i tried the bounds of <m> c _ n </m> -LRB- denotes the <m> n </m> - th composite number -RRB- given in this paper to prove that the sum <m> c _ { p _ n - m } + c _ { m - n } </m> satisfies the following properties , <m>  </m> n <m>  </m> n <m>  </m> but could n't solve it . i think that to prove this problem we need some more stronger bounds than that of those given in the paper . are there any such stronger bounds ? i have tried searching in the internet but i did n't find anything relevant . any help will be appreciated .

let <m> \Lambda </m> be a lattice with basis , <m> B </m> consisting of vectors <m> b _ i </m> , so that the elements of <m> \Lambda </m> are of form , <m> y \in \Lambda \iff y = B x = \sum _ i b _ i x _ i </m> for some <m> x _ i \in \mathbb { Z } </m> . my questions are as follows . suppose that , i restrict myself to the following optimization problem : <m> \min _ { y \in \Lambda : y = B x , x _ i \in \{ - 1 , 1 \} } \| y \| _ 2 . </m> this is nothing but the shortest vector problem with <m> x </m> restricted , and it is well-known that lll algorithm approximates the shortest vector problem -LRB- in unconstrained setup -RRB- in polynomial time . are there complexity results -LRB- in particular , average case complexity -RRB- , for such problems that anyone is aware of ? a second question pertains a close cousin of this problem , namely , the closest vector problem . suppose , i fix a vector <m> z </m> with rational -LRB- or integer coefficients -RRB- , and i am asking for the member of lattice <m> \Lambda </m> that is closest to <m> z </m> , namely , <m> \min _ { y \in \Lambda , y = B x , x _ i \in \{ - 1 , 1 \} } \| y - z \| _ 2 . </m> a similar question goes . are there any average-case hardness results -LRB- or in general , any sort of hardness for this restricted scheme -RRB- that anyone is aware of ?
let <m> G </m> be a finite 2-group . let <m> x </m> be a non-central element of <m> G </m> such that <m> C _ G ( x ) \leq c l ( x ) \cup Z ( G ) </m> where <m> c l ( x ) </m> denotes the conjugacy class of <m> x </m> in <m> G </m> . is it true that <m> | C _ G ( x ) : Z ( G ) | = 2 </m> ? p.s. i know that if <m> | G | \leq 2 ^ 8 </m> then the equality holds .
let <m> u </m> be the weak solution on a smooth bounded domain <m> \Omega \subset \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> -LRB- for <m> n \leq 3 </m> -RRB- of <m> u _ t - \Delta u = f </m> <m> u ( 0 ) = u _ 0 </m> <m>  </m> \ partial \ omega <m>  </m> for <m> u _ 0 \in L ^ \infty ( \Omega ) </m> -LRB- non-negative -RRB- and <m> f \in L ^ \infty ( 0 , T ; L ^ 2 ( \Omega ) ) </m> . we know that <m> u ( t , x ) \leq C ( \lVert u _ 0 \rVert _ \infty + \lVert f \rVert _ { L ^ \infty ( 0 , T ; L ^ 2 ) } ) </m> is satisfied almost every <m> ( x , t ) </m> by de giorgi 's method -LRB- eg . theorem 4.2.2 in `` elliptic and parabolic equations '' book by wu , yin and wang -RRB- . if instead we had the equation <m> u _ t - \Delta u + \alpha u = f </m> for a constant <m> \alpha > 0 </m> -LRB- and all else is the same as above -RRB- , can i expect some kind of decay on the <m> L ^ \infty </m> estimate involving <m> \alpha </m> , eg . <m> u ( t , x ) \leq \frac { C } { \alpha } ( \lVert u _ 0 \rVert _ \infty + \lVert f \rVert _ { L ^ \infty ( 0 , T ; L ^ 2 ) } ) ? </m> it is essential for me that <m> f </m> is only in <m> L ^ \infty ( 0 , T ; L ^ 2 ) </m> . of course i tried using an integrating factor , but this gives a bad contribution on the term involving the <m> f </m> norm . i wonder if it can be true .
let <m> X </m> be a smooth complex projective fano threefold . then the class <m> c _ 1 ( X ) </m> can be realised as an effective divisor in <m> X </m> . it is it true that the class <m> c _ 2 ( X ) </m> can be realised as an effective curve ? -LRB- note that <m> c _ 3 </m> can not , since the euler characteristics of the cubic fano <m> 3 </m> - fold is negative -RRB-
there is a problem in this estimate . in part 2 , we ca n't derive the second inequality from the first inequality in part 2 . the main reason is the last term on the rhs in the first inequality is in <m> \| \cdot \| _ 1 </m> not <m> \| \cdot \| _ 0 </m> . how can i fix this proof or are there any stability result controlling <m> \tau \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ k \| \partial _ \tau u _ h ^ n \| _ 0 ^ 2 </m> where <m> f \in L ^ 2 ( 0 , T ; H ^ { - 1 } ( \Omega ) ) </m> . for your convenience , you can focus on part 2 . also i have shown other parts in the proof for your reference .
say i have a voronoi diagram of some points <m> p _ 1 , \dots , p _ n \in \mathbb { R } ^ d </m> , which tesselates <m> \mathbb { R } ^ d </m> into cells <m> V _ 1 , \dots , V _ n </m> . within each cell <m> V _ i </m> , the pole is defined as the vertex of <m> V _ i </m> that maximizes the distance to the landmark point <m> p _ i </m> , i.e. <m> \arg \max _ { x \in V _ i } \| x - p _ i \| </m> . is there an efficient algorithm for computing these poles ? it seems that this is well-studied in <m> d = 2 </m> but i can not find any literature on other cases .
endow the dual space <m> \mathcal { E } </m> of smooth functions <m> C ^ \infty </m> -LRB- with its metrizable topology described by uniform convergence on compacts for convergent sequences -RRB- with the weak * topology . let <m> D </m> be a dense subset of <m> \mathcal { E } </m> . is it true that <m> D </m> is also sequentially dense in <m> \mathcal { E } </m> ?
let <m> C = ( v _ 1 , v _ 2 , \ldots , v _ i ) </m> be a cycle of a graph that is drawn in <m> R ^ 3 </m> in the shape of an unknot -LRB- not knotted -RRB- with straight line segments as its edges . bound a disk <m> D </m> by <m> C </m> -LRB- <m> C </m> should be the boundary of <m> D </m> -RRB- . we would like <m> D </m> to have the minimum area subject to the fixed position of the vertices of <m> C </m> -LRB- the boundary of <m> D </m> -RRB- . clearly such a disk is in the shape of a geometric triangle if <m> C </m> is a cycle with 3 vertices . but what would <m> D </m> look like if <m> C </m> has more than 3 vertices ? are the two following statements true ? 1 - say <m> C </m> has four vertices , then the shape of <m> D </m> is not going to be in the shape of two geometric triangles that are glued to each other at a chord of <m> C </m> -LRB- it is going to be curved -RRB- : imagine a cycle with four vertices <m> a , b , c , d </m> where vertices <m> a , b , c , d </m> are not coplanar and bound this cycle with an elastic material -LRB- like part of a balloon -RRB- . 2 - let the local sphere of a vertex <m> v </m> be a very small sphere -LRB- a sphere with radius <m> \epsilon </m> where <m> \epsilon </m> is close to <m> 0 </m> -RRB- centred at <m> v </m> . is it the case that the intersection of <m> D </m> and the local sphere of the vertices of <m> C </m> would be located on a great circle of the local sphere . do you know of any literature that perhaps confirms the above points or maybe describes the shape of such minimum-area disks ?
let <m> A </m> , <m> B </m> be finite groups . is it true that all short exact sequences <m> 1 \rightarrow A \rightarrow A \times B \rightarrow B \rightarrow 1 </m> split on the right ? in other words , do there exist finite groups <m> A </m> , <m> B </m> and homomorphisms <m> f : A \rightarrow A \times B </m> , <m> g : A \times B \rightarrow B </m> such that <m> 1 \rightarrow A \rightarrow A \times B \rightarrow B \rightarrow 1 </m> is exact and there does not exist a homomorphism <m> h : B \rightarrow A \times B </m> such that <m> g \circ h = \text { i d } _ B </m> ? an example when <m> A </m> , <m> B </m> are not finite is given by <m> A = \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ \infty \mathbb { Z } </m> , <m> B = \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ \infty \mathbb { Z } / 2 \mathbb { Z } </m> , <m> f ( ( n _ i ) ) = ( ( 2 n _ i ) , 0 ) </m> , and <m> g ( ( n _ i ) , ( m _ i ) ) = ( \overline { n _ 1 } , m _ 1 , \overline { n _ 2 } , m _ 2 , \ldots ) </m> .
to a symmetric sequence <m> V _ \bullet </m> of vector spaces , associate the generating function <m> F _ V ( z ) = \sum _ n \frac { \dim ( V _ n ) } { n ! } z ^ n </m> . then <m> F _ { C o m m _ \ast } ( z ) = \exp ( z ) - 1 \qquad F _ { L i e } ( z ) = \ln ( 1 - z ) </m> where <m> C o m m _ \ast </m> is the reduced commutative operad and <m> L i e </m> is the lie operad . notice that
this was post by me on maths se : but it did not get any solution . some months ago i made the following conjecture - let <m> d ( n ) </m> denote the number of divisors of <m> n </m> . then let <m> N </m> be a number such that <m> d ( N ) </m> divides <m> N </m> . also let <m> I = \frac { N } { d ( N ) } </m> which is defined as the `` index of beauty of <m> N </m> '' . then , for every number <m> I </m> there exists a number <m> N </m> such that <m> I </m> is the index of beauty of <m> N </m> . this conjecture was proved false by greg martin here . he said that it can be showed by exaustive computation that the following <m> I </m> fail the conjecture under <m> 1 0 0 0 </m> are <m> \{ 1 8 , 2 7 , 3 0 , 4 5 , 6 3 , 6 4 , 7 2 , 9 9 , 1 0 5 , 1 1 2 , 1 1 7 , 1 4 4 , 1 5 3 , 1 6 0 , 1 6 2 , 1 6 5 , 1 7 1 , 1 9 5 , 2 0 7 , 2 2 5 , 2 4 3 , 2 5 2 , 2 5 5 , 2 6 1 , 2 7 9 , 2 8 5 , 2 8 8 , 2 9 4 , 3 2 0 , 3 3 3 , 3 3 6 , 3 4 5 , 3 5 2 , 3 6 0 , 3 6 9 , 3 8 7 , 3 9 6 , 4 0 5 , 4 1 6 , 4 2 3 , 4 3 5 , 4 4 1 , 4 6 5 , 4 6 8 , 4 7 7 , 4 9 0 , 5 0 4 , 5 3 1 , 5 4 4 , 5 4 9 , 5 5 5 , 5 6 7 , 5 7 6 , 6 0 3 , 6 0 8 , 6 1 2 , 6 1 5 , 6 1 6 , 6 2 5 , 6 3 9 , 6 4 5 , 6 5 7 , 6 8 4 , 7 0 5 , 7 1 1 , 7 2 6 , 7 2 8 , 7 3 5 , 7 3 6 , 7 4 7 , 7 9 2 , 7 9 5 , 8 0 1 , 8 1 0 , 8 2 8 , 8 4 0 , 8 7 3 , 8 8 0 , 8 8 5 , 8 9 1 , 9 0 9 , 9 1 5 , 9 2 7 , 9 2 8 , 9 3 6 , 9 5 2 , 9 6 0 , 9 6 3 , 9 8 1 , 9 9 2 \} </m> now what i am interested is that sequence of <m> I </m> that fails .
i am trying to learn about some categorical aspects of topological quantum field theories . for concreteness , i am considering chern simons theory with gauge group <m> G </m> in three dimensions . as i understand , i can describe the theory as a functor <m> F </m> on a cobordism category where there are <m> 0 </m> , <m> 1 </m> and <m> 2 </m> dimensional objects -LRB- manifolds -RRB- and morphisms between objects . let me denote some <m> \mathbb C </m> - linear <m> n </m> - categories as <m> C _ n </m> , such that the functor <m> F </m> leads to following assignments : <m> F ( S ^ 3 ) = C _ { - 1 } = : Z _ { S ^ 3 } \, , \qquad F ( S ^ 2 ) = C _ 0 = : \mathcal H _ { S ^ 2 } \, , \qquad F ( S ^ 1 ) = C _ 1 \, , \qquad F ( \{ \mathrm { p t } \} ) = C _ 2 \, . </m> where <m> S ^ n </m> is the <m> n </m> - dimensional sphere , <m> \mathcal H _ { S ^ 2 } </m> is a vector space -LRB- with an inner product -RRB- , and <m> Z _ { S ^ 3 } </m> is a complex number , this question does not concern the 2-category <m> F ( \{ \mathrm { p t } \} ) </m> . the 1-category <m> F ( S ^ 1 ) </m> is a category of some representations of the affine lie group <m> \widehat G </m> . question : how do i compute the number <m> Z _ { S ^ 3 } </m> given only the 1-category <m> F ( S ^ 1 ) </m> ? as a clarification of what i am asking let me explain how i would proceed for the simpler problem of computing <m> Z _ { S ^ 3 } </m> given the 0-category <m> F ( S ^ 2 ) </m> . given <m> \mathcal H _ { S ^ 2 } </m> , i can construct <m> S ^ 3 </m> as <m> S ^ 3 = \bar D ^ 3 \sqcup _ { S ^ 2 } \bar D ^ 3 </m> where i am gluing two closed three dimensional discs along their <m> S ^ 2 </m> boundaries and my understanding is that -LRB- i would like to know if this is incorrect -RRB- <m> F </m> assigns to <m> \bar D ^ 3 </m> an element of <m> F ( \partial \bar D ^ 3 ) = F ( S ^ 2 ) = \mathcal H _ { S ^ 2 } </m> , i.e. <m> F ( \bar D ^ 3 ) </m> is a vector and the result of the gluing is that <m> F ( S ^ 3 ) = \langle F ( \bar D ^ 3 ) , F ( \bar D ^ 3 ) \rangle </m> where <m> \langle - , - \rangle </m> is an inner product -LRB- which can be written as a path integral over <m> S ^ 3 </m> -RRB- . i would like to know what is the analogous procedure if i start from one dimension bellow . if the answer is standard or trivial i will be happy with a reference , and if it helps anyone willing to write an answer , i am more familiar with the physics side of the subject than the math side . thanks in advance for any help . edit : -LRB- some attempts -RRB- i can try to construct <m> F ( S ^ 2 ) </m> from the knowledge of <m> F ( S ^ 1 ) </m> by gluing two <m> \bar D ^ 2 </m> 's along their boundary <m> S ^ 1 </m> . <m> F ( \bar D ^ 2 ) </m> should be an object of the 1-category <m> F ( S ^ 1 ) </m> , so <m> F ( \bar D ^ 2 ) </m> is a <m> \widehat G </m> - module , therefore the image of two disjoint <m> \bar D ^ 2 </m> 's -LRB- with one `` incoming '' and one `` outgoing '' boundary -RRB- under <m> F </m> should be <m> F \left ( \bar D ^ 2 \sqcup \left ( \bar D ^ 2 \right ) ^ * \right ) = F ( \bar D ^ 2 ) \otimes F ( \bar D ^ 2 ) ^ * \, . </m> finally from the physical point of view the following seems reasonable : <m> F ( S ^ 2 ) = F \left ( \bar D ^ 2 \sqcup _ { S ^ 1 } \left ( \bar D ^ 2 \right ) ^ * \right ) = \left ( F ( \bar D ^ 2 ) \otimes F ( \bar D ^ 2 ) ^ * \right ) ^ { \widehat G } \, . \tag { 1 } </m> then i can proceed along the line described earlier for the simpler situation of having the data of <m> F ( S ^ 2 ) </m> . this kind of answers my original question . for the sake of being able to do computation i have two followup questions : followup question 1 : how exactly do i decide which element of <m> F ( S ^ 2 ) </m> to assign to <m> F ( \bar D ^ 3 ) </m> -LRB- without using a path integral definition of a wave functional -RRB- ? is it part of the axioms or is there a derivation ? followup question 2 : in -LRB- 1 -RRB- , if i choose a basis <m> \{ e _ i \} </m> for <m> F ( \bar D ^ 2 ) </m> -LRB- and a dual basis <m> \{ e _ i ^ * \} </m> for <m> F ( \bar D ^ 2 ) ^ * </m> -RRB- , then <m> F ( S ^ 2 ) </m> seems to be the one dimensional space <m> \mathrm { S p a n } \left ( \sum _ i e _ i \otimes e _ i ^ * \right ) </m> , if <m> F ( \bar D ^ 2 ) </m> is infinite dimensional then is there a problem with normalization for the vectors in <m> F ( S ^ 2 ) </m> ? perhaps i am making some silly mistakes , sorry for the lengthy post !
first of all , i apologize if this is too elementary for mo. i am reposting this from mse where i asked this question two days ago -LRB- link to mse post -RRB- . i 've been wondering about the following thing . let <m> A </m> be a commutative ring -LRB- with unit -RRB- such that <m> A [ [ T ] ] </m> is noetherian . can we conclude that <m> A [ T ] </m> is noetherian without invoking hilbert 's basis theorem -LRB- or a similar argument -RRB- ? in other words , if we know noetherianity of the power series ring , do we get noetherianity of the polynomial ring `` for almost free '' ? notice that the canonical epimorphism <m> A [ [ T ] ] \twoheadrightarrow A </m> gives us the noetherian property for <m> A </m> , which then implies noetherianity of <m> A [ T ] </m> by the usual polynomial hilbert basis theorem -LRB- hbt for short -RRB- . however , if we wish to skip hbt , the implication is non-obvious -LRB- at least to me -RRB- since noetherianity is not `` inclusion-borne '' . moreover , notice that the opposite direction does not require hbt as <m> A [ [ T ] ] </m> is the <m> ( T ) </m> - adic completion of <m> A [ T ] </m> . all the standard texts on commutative algebra -LRB- am , kaplansky , matsumura , zariski-samuel -RRB- appear to give separate proofs one way or another . even though the proofs of both cases are deceivingly similar and polynomials are a special case of power series , both theorems seem content-wise quite distant from each other .
any grammar for the language <m>  </m> p <m> math_0 </m> is such a grammar related to any question of number theory like rh or the conjecture of twin primes ?
take the projective space <m> \mathbb { P } ^ n </m> over a ring <m> W </m> . we call <m> \mathcal { O } ( q ) </m> the usual twisted line bundle . now take the map <m> f : \mathbb { P } ^ n \to \mathbb { P } ^ n </m> defined by <m> [ x _ 0 , \ldots , x _ n ] \mapsto [ x _ 0 ^ g , \ldots , x _ n ^ g ] </m> for some fixed <m> g </m> . now take the inverse limit <m> X = \varprojlim \mathbb { P } ^ n </m> , where the transition maps are the map <m> f </m> , every time . call <m> p : X \to \mathbb { P } ^ n </m> the projection .
of course the general answer to the question in the title is : not very simple . i could not think of a better title , so let me explain my question in more detail . i have a number field <m> E / \mathbb { Q } </m> , and a simple group <m> H / E </m> . let <m> G </m> denote the weil restriction of scalars of <m> H </m> from <m> E </m> to <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> . then <m> G </m> is a <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> - simple group . the group <m> G _ { \ell } : = G _ { \mathbb { Q } _ { \ell } } </m> is not <m> \mathbb { Q } _ { \ell } </m> - simple in general . short aside : however , if <m> n = [ E : \mathbb { Q } ] \le 3 </m> there is always an <m> \ell </m> such that <m> G _ { \ell } </m> is <m> \mathbb { Q } _ { \ell } </m> - simple . -LRB- for a short proof : consider the galois action of <m> \mathrm { G a l } ( \bar { \mathbb { Q } } / \mathbb { Q } ) </m> on the <m> n </m> factors of <m> G _ { \bar { \mathbb { Q } } } </m> . this action is transitive . since <m> n \le 3 </m> , there must therefore be an <m> n </m> - cycle in the action , and by chebotarev there will be -LRB- infinitely many -RRB- primes <m> \ell </m> , such that <m> \mathrm { G a l } ( \bar { \mathbb { Q } _ { \ell } } / \mathbb { Q } _ { \ell } ) </m> acts transitively on the factors of <m> G _ { \bar { \mathbb { Q } _ { \ell } } } </m> . -LSB- proof copied from d. lombardo , arxiv : 1402.1478 -RSB- -RRB- my question is about what happens if <m> n > 3 </m> . -LRB- in my particular case <m> n \le 1 0 </m> . -RRB- for example , i would be very happy , if there is always a prime <m> \ell </m> , so that all the <m> \mathbb { Q } _ { \ell } </m> - simple factors of <m> G _ { \ell } </m> are not absolutely simple . is something like that true ?
let <m> X </m> be a connected compact riemann surface . how does one go on proving that the set of pgl -LRB- <m> n , \mathbb { C } </m> -RRB- - bundles over <m> X </m> is topologically classified by <m> \pi _ 1 ( P G L ( n , \mathbb { C } ) ) </m> ? is it true for more general groups than pgl -LRB- <m> n , \mathbb { C } </m> -RRB- ? thanks in advance .
edited : i guess <m> H ^ 2 _ { ( x , y ) } \left ( \frac { \Bbb Z [ x , y ] } { ( 5 x + 4 y ) } \right ) = 0 </m> we know that if <m> \operatorname { S u p p } H ^ i _ I ( M ) \subseteq V ( I ) \cap \operatorname { S u p p } ( M ) </m> , then <m> \operatorname { S u p p } H ^ 2 _ { ( x , y ) } \frac { \Bbb Z [ x , y ] } { ( 5 x + 4 y ) } ) \subseteq V ( ( x , y ) ) \cap V ( ( 5 x + 4 y ) ) = V ( ( x , y ) ) = \lbrace ( x , y ) \rbrace \cup \lbrace ( x , y , p ) \rbrace </m> where <m> p </m> is prime number . if we could show that for every <m> P \in V ( ( x , y ) ) </m> , <m> \left ( H ^ 2 _ { ( x , y ) } \left ( \frac { \Bbb Z [ x , y ] } { ( 5 x + 4 y ) } \right ) \right ) _ P = 0 </m> then it is done . background : <m> H ^ i _ I ( M ) </m> means <m> i </m> - th local cohomology module of <m> M </m> with respect to ideal <m> I </m> . <m> V ( I ) = \lbrace P \in S p e c ( R ) ; I \subseteq P \rbrace </m> and <m> \operatorname { S u p p } ( M ) = \lbrace P \in \operatorname { S p e c } ( R ) ; M _ p \neq 0 \rbrace </m> and <m> M _ P </m> means <m> M </m> localized at prime ideal <m> P </m> . furthermore <m> \operatorname { S u p p } ( R / I ) = V ( I ) </m> .
is a well known fact that <m> S O ( 3 ) </m> acts transitively on <m> S ^ 2 </m> and that the isotropy group of this action is <m> S O ( 2 ) . </m> in this case , <m> S ^ 2 </m> has a natural structure of homogeneous space . in particular , i wonder that is true that <m> S O ( 3 ) \times S O ( 3 ) </m> acts transitively on <m> S ^ 2 \times S ^ 2 </m> and it has a natural structure of homogeneous space . if we consider in this space the natural <m> S O ( 3 ) - </m> invariant metric in <m> S ^ 2 </m> then we have in <m> S ^ 2 \times S ^ 2 </m> the product metric and in this metric there are several directions where the curvature is zero . my question is the following , does there exists a homogeneous structure on <m> S ^ 2 \times S ^ 2 </m> that is not similar to the product structure ? i.e. such that <m> S ^ 2 \times S ^ 2 </m> is not the quotient of a product of groups ? the point of this questions is that if it is the case , we can search for <m> G - </m> invariant metrics oh <m> S ^ 2 \times S ^ 2 </m> using the possible reductive decomposition of the lie algebra <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> , so it is a manner to search for eventual positively curved metrics .
the question is as in the is <m> K _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } [ x , x ^ { - 1 } ] ) </m> known ?
consider the following element <m> A </m> in <m> U ( n ) </m> : <m> \begin {pmatrix} 1 / 2 ( 1 + z ) & 1 / 2 ( 1 - z ) & \\ \\ 1 / 2 ( 1 - z ) & 1 / 2 ( 1 + z ) & \\ \\ & & I _ { n - 2 } \end {pmatrix} , </m> where <m> | z | = 1 </m> . now conjugate <m> A </m> by permutation matrices <m> S </m> , i.e. , <m> S ( i , j ) = 1 </m> if <m> \sigma ( i ) = j </m> for a fixed <m> \sigma \in S _ n </m> . what group does <m> S A S ^ { - 1 } </m> generate ? what is its dimension ? finally let <m> A ' = \begin {pmatrix} i & - i & \\ \\ - i & i & \\ \\ & & 0 _ { n - 2 } \end {pmatrix} </m> be the associated lie algebra element to <m> A </m> -LRB- i.e. , derivative with respect to <m> z </m> at <m> z = 1 </m> ; notice the condition <m> | z | = 1 </m> -RRB- . can one give an explicit basis of the lie algebra closure generated by <m> S A S ^ { - 1 } </m> , with each element <m> B </m> in the basis of the form <m> A d ( A d ( \ldots A d ( A d ( A d ( A d ( S _ 1 , A ) , A d ( S _ 2 , A ) ) \ldots , A d ( S _ k , A ) ) , A d ( S _ 0 , A ' ) ) </m> , where <m> S _ i </m> , <m> i = 0 , 1 , \ldots , k </m> are permutation matrices . edit : i now have the following conjecture regarding the lie algebra : it is simply given by <m> \{ A \in \mathfrak { u } ( n ) : \sum _ j A _ { i j } = 0 , \text { f o r a l l } i \in [ n ] \} </m> , so it looks like the dimension should be <m> n ^ 2 - 2 n + 1 </m> . if so the group will be <m> U ( n - 1 ) </m> acting on <m> V = \{ z _ 1 + \ldots + z _ n = 0 \} </m> . the construction of explicit basis by adjoint action remains .
prikry forcing can be used to produce a model <m> V </m> of <m> Z F C </m> such that fo rsome cardinal <m> \kappa </m> we have : -LRB- 1 -RRB- <m> \kappa </m> is singular in <m> V </m> of cofinality <m> \omega , </m> -LRB- 2 -RRB- <m> \kappa </m> is regular -LRB- and in fact measurable -RRB- in <m> H O D </m> . now my question is can this happen with <m> \kappa </m> having uncountable cofinality in <m> V </m> . so
the construction of <m> L [ A ] </m> can be considered for the case when <m> A </m> is a class of ordinals . we simply consider things which are definable over the language <m> \{ \in , A \} </m> instead of just <m> \{ \in \} </m> . originally i thought that <m> L [ O r d ] = H O D </m> , but was told that actually <m> L [ O r d ] = L </m> . denote <m> \mathcal P ( O r d ) = \bigcup _ { \alpha \in O r d } \mathcal P ( \alpha ) </m> , all the sets of ordinals in <m> V </m> . i then figured that perhaps <m> L [ \mathcal P ( O r d ) ] = H O D </m> , but that too i was told is not true . in fact , as the conversation continued , <m> H O D </m> is the second-order <m> L </m> , that is we construct <m> L </m> as usual -LRB- in <m> V </m> -RRB- , only defining it with second-order logic instead . if this is the case , what is <m> L [ \mathcal P ( O r d ) ] </m> ?
let <m> \mathbf R </m> denote the real numbers , let 's take a finite number of points in <m> \mathbf R ^ 2 </m> and let 's take the ideal <m> I </m> of all the polynomials that vanish on this points . using the hilbert basis theorem we know that <m> I </m> is finitely generated . i want to know if there exists an element in this ideal that is an irreducible polynomial . clearly i can suppose that all the finite generators are not irreducible , otherwise it 's done . using this , how can i find such a polynomial ?
let <m> A </m> be a <m> m \times n </m> matrix with <m> n \sim m ^ 2 </m> and with rank <m> m </m> , and <m> C </m> a <m> n \times n </m> permutation matrix of order 2 . is it true that <m> A C A ^ T </m> is always invertible ? or in some special cases ? if it helps : you may assume <m> A </m> is in row echelon form with all entries being 0 or 1 .
let <m> M </m> be a closed compact manifold . is the space of all <m> C ^ 1 </m> immersions from <m> M </m> to <m> \mathbb { R } ^ m </m> -LRB- <m> m > \dim M </m> -RRB- dense in <m> C ^ 1 ( M ; \mathbb { R } ^ m ) </m> -LRB- in the <m> C ^ 1 </m> topology -RRB- ?
let <m> M </m> be a closed , triangulated manifold of dimension <m> m </m> and <m> K ( M ) </m> be its triangulation . let <m> f _ i </m> denote the number of <m> i </m> - simplices of <m> K ( M ) </m> . as proved by klee the face numbers satisfy the following dehn-sommerville relations <m> f _ k = \sum _ { i = k } ^ m ( - 1 ) ^ { i + m } \binom { i + 1 } { k + 1 } f _ i , </m> for <m> k = 0 , 1 , \dots , m </m> . the above formula holds true for more general spaces called the semi-eulerian complexes -LRB- i.e. , these are simplicial complexes such that the euler characteristic of the link of every non-empty face is equal to that of an appropriate-dimensional sphere -RRB- . recall that the <m> h </m> - vector of a simplicial complex is defined as <m> h _ i = \sum _ { j = 0 } ^ i ( - 1 ) ^ { i - j } \binom { m - j } { m - i } f _ { j - 1 } </m> for <m> 0 \leq i \leq m + 1 </m> . the dehn-sommerville relations have a particularly beautiful expression in terms of these <m> h </m> - vectors : <m> h _ { m + 1 - i } - h _ i = ( - 1 ) ^ i \binom { m } { i } ( \chi ( M ) - \chi ( S ^ m ) ) </m> for <m> 0 \leq i \leq m + 1 </m> . my question : do these relations hold if one were to have a <m> \Delta </m> - complex -LRB- i.e. , semi-simplicial complex -RRB- instead of simplicial triangulation of the manifold -LRB- one might have to assume the structure to be regular , i.e. , attaching maps for homeomorphisms -RRB- ? is there an analogue of semi-eulerian complex for <m> \Delta </m> - complexes ?
let <m> \mathbf { Q } ^ { \mathrm { a b } } </m> be the maximal abelian extension of the field of rational numbers <m> \mathbf { Q } </m> . i 'm interested in the following question : is it true that <m> K ^ { M } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { Q } ^ { \mathrm { a b } } ) / p K ^ { M } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { Q } ^ { \mathrm { a b } } ) = 0 </m> for any prime <m> p </m> ? where <m> K ^ { M } _ { \ast } </m> is milnor <m> K </m> - theory .
i 'm trying to work out explicitly the spectral decomposition of <m> L ^ 2 ( G ( \mathbb { Q } ) \backslash G ( \mathbb { A } ) ) </m> when <m> G </m> is anisotropic -- it has no split tori defined over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> . i know that this should mean that <m> L ^ 2 </m> decomposes discretely into a direct sum of irreducible unitary representations . i 'm looking at arthur 's papers `` eisenstein series and the trace formula '' as well as `` the trace formula for reductive groups i , '' -LRB- duke 1978 -RRB- and i 'm having trouble seeing how at the end of the day , the decomposition one gets should end up being discrete , into a direct sum of cuspidal representations . i know that here <m> G = P = M </m> and that <m> A </m> , the split component of the center of <m> M </m> , is trivial . how should the expansion simplify in this case ? in more detail , let 's assume for simplicity that <m> G </m> is adjoint -LRB- so we wo n't have to worry about the center -RRB- as well as anisotropic over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> . arthur takes <m> K </m> to be a certain nice compact subgroup of <m> G ( \mathbb { A } ) </m> , with the haar measure of <m> K </m> taken to be one . a haar measure on <m> G ( \mathbb { A } ) </m> is also fixed . then it is known that <m> L ^ 2 ( G ( \mathbb { Q } ) \backslash G ( \mathbb { A } ) ) = L ^ 2 _ { c u s p } ( G ( \mathbb { Q } ) \backslash G ( \mathbb { A } ) ) = \bigoplus _ \rho V _ \rho </m> , where <m> \rho </m> ranges over all irreducible unitary representations of <m> G ( \mathbb { A } ) </m> , and each <m> V _ \rho </m> is a <m> G ( \mathbb { A } ) </m> - invariant subspace of <m> L ^ 2 ( G ( \mathbb { Q } ) \backslash G ( \mathbb { A } ) ) </m> isomorphic under the action of <m> G ( \mathbb { A } ) </m> to a finite number of copies of <m> \rho </m> . -LRB- if <m> V _ \rho \neq 0 </m> we call <m> \rho </m> cuspidal . -RRB- arthur then goes further on page 925 of the paper . let <m> \psi </m> be a smooth function on <m> G ( \mathbb { Q } ) \backslash G ( \mathbb { A } ) </m> such that <m> \psi </m> transforms under <m> K _ \mathbb { R } </m> according to an irreducible representation <m> W </m> . then <m> \psi \in L ^ 2 ( G ( \mathbb { Q } ) \backslash G ( \mathbb { A } ) ) </m> . define <m> L ^ 2 ( G ( \mathbb { Q } ) \backslash G ( \mathbb { A } ) ) _ \rho </m> to be the closed span of all functions of the form <m> \psi </m> where <m> W </m> varies over all irreducible representations of <m> K _ \mathbb { R } </m> . then <m> L ^ 2 ( G ( \mathbb { Q } ) \backslash G ( \mathbb { A } ) ) = \bigoplus _ \rho L ^ 2 ( G ( \mathbb { Q } ) \backslash G ( \mathbb { A } ) ) _ \rho </m> . my first question is : this does n't seem to depend on <m> \rho </m> . how does this definition make sense ? -LRB- arthur 's notation is <m> \chi \in ( M , \rho ) </m> , but here <m> M = G </m> so i used <m> \rho </m> instead of <m> \chi </m> . -RRB- let <m> \Pi ( G ) </m> denote the set of equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of <m> G ( \mathbb { A } ) </m> . this is a discrete set . for <m> \pi \in \Pi ( G ) </m> , arthur then defines <m> H _ G ^ 0 ( \pi ) </m> to be the space of functions <m> \phi : G ( \mathbb { Q } ) \backslash G ( \mathbb { A } ) \rightarrow \mathbb { C } </m> which satisfy certain properties . its completion , <m> H _ G ( \pi ) </m> , is a hilbert space . he then defines for each irreducible unitary representation <m> \rho </m> of <m> G ( \mathbb { A } ) </m> a certain closed subspace <m> H _ G ( \pi ) _ \rho </m> of <m> H _ G ( \pi ) </m> and says that <m> H _ G ( \pi ) </m> is the direct sum of the <m> H _ G ( \pi ) _ \rho </m> -- he also says that he does n't know if <m> H _ G ( \pi ) _ \rho </m> can be nonzero for more than one <m> \rho </m> - presumably this means for <m> \rho \neq \pi </m> ! arthur then fixes an orthonormal basis of each <m> H _ G ( \pi ) _ \rho </m> -LRB- thereby giving a basis for <m> H _ G ( \pi ) </m> -RRB- and defines <m> \hat { L } _ G </m> to be the set of functions <m> F </m> taking <m> \pi \in \Pi ( G ) </m> to <m> H _ G ( \pi ) </m> such that <m> \Sigma _ \pi | | F _ \pi | | ^ 2 \ d \pi < \infty </m> . then the map which sends <m> F </m> to the function <m> x \mapsto \Sigma _ \pi F _ \pi ( x ) </m> , defined for <m> F </m> is a dense subspace of <m> \hat { L } _ G </m> , extends to a unitary map from <m> \hat { L } _ G </m> onto a closed <m> G ( \mathbb { A } ) </m> - invariant subspace , whose completion is <m> L ^ 2 ( G ( \mathbb { Q } ) \backslash G ( \mathbb { A } ) ) </m> . based on this , i think arthur is saying that <m> L ^ 2 </m> for <m> G </m> anisotropic and adjoint is the completion of functions of the form <m> x \mapsto \Sigma _ \pi \Sigma _ \rho \Sigma _ { \phi _ { \pi , \rho , i } \in B _ G ( \pi ) _ \rho } \langle { F _ \pi , \phi _ { \pi , \rho , i } \rangle } \phi _ { \pi , \rho , i } ( x ) </m> . is that correct ? i do n't see how this is reconciled with the earlier description as a direct sum of cuspidal representations .
let <m> \chi : ( \mathbb Z / f \mathbb Z ) ^ \times \to K = \mathbb Q ( \mu _ { \phi ( f ) } ) </m> be a primitive dirichlet character . assume moreover that it is not quadratic , that is , <m> \chi ^ 2 </m> is not the trivial character . let <m> \pi _ 1 , \dots , \pi _ g </m> be the primes lying over <m> 2 </m> and <m> v _ 1 , \dots , v _ g </m> be the corresponding valuations . recall that : <m> L ( 0 , \chi ) = \frac 1 f \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ f n \chi ( n ) </m> experimentally -LRB- upto conductor 200 -RRB- , i find that there always exists some <m> k </m> such that <m> v _ k ( L ( 0 , \chi ) ) > 0 </m> . does anyone know a proof ? note that it is not true that <m> 2 | L ( 0 , \chi ) </m> . for instance , for for the character of conductor <m> 5 </m> mapping <m> 2 \to i </m> , we have <m> L ( 0 , \chi ) = ( i + 3 ) / 5 </m> . there are lots of other examples . note also that we do require the condition that <m> \chi </m> is non quadratic . for instance , if <m> f = p \equiv 3 \pmod 4 </m> and <m> \chi </m> is quadratic , then : <m> p L ( 0 , \chi ) \equiv ( p - 1 ) / 2 \equiv 1 \pmod 2 . </m> i asked this question a few hours before on stackexchange but at the suggestion of someone , i am posting it here . i have deleted the question on stackexchange .
let <m> \mathbb { F } _ q </m> be a finite field with <m> q = p ^ f </m> elements . i need to know when <m> \mathrm { P S L } _ 2 ( \mathbb { F } _ q ) </m> contains the group <m> D _ { ( q + 1 ) / 2 } </m> , where by <m> D _ n </m> i mean the dihedral group of order <m> 2 n </m> . also if such a classification of <m> q </m> exists , can we write explicit generators of <m> D _ { ( q + 1 ) / 2 } </m> ? thanks
i was wondering what the cardinality of <m> \omega \uparrow ^ \omega \omega </m> is , with <m> \uparrow </m> being knuth 's up-arrow notation . i ask this purely out of curiosity ; after finding out about set theory i feel like a child with a new toy . i 'm not on the same level as everyone else on this site , and everything i 've learned about set theory i 've learned on wikipedia . the answer to my question might very well be there , but after much searching and attempts to understand the language there , i 'm still not sure . is this an appropriate question for this site ? thank you .
the reason for my question is the following : the two-dimensional canonical singularities are the ade-singularities , which all are quotients of either affine space or another ade-singularity by finite abelian groups and even more , quotients of affine 2-space by finite solvable groups but one - namely <m> E _ 8 </m> , which is factorial and a quotient of <m> A _ 1 </m> by the perfect group <m> A _ 5 </m> . now a generalization of the ade-singularities in dimension 3 are the compound du val singularities , which are canonical and are formally equivalent to <m> f ( x , y , z ) + t g ( x , y , z , t ) </m> , where f is the polynomial of an ade-singularity . now some of these are again quotients of affine 3-space , while a lot more than the one before -LRB- <m> E _ 8 </m> -RRB- are factorial . for example the one in the heading . which means in particular , that they can not be a quotient of affine space by a solvable group . as you may see now , it would be very nice , if these singularities were also some quotients by any groups . any idea ? i am quite sure that it ca n't be a finite group and affine 3-space . thank you and looking forward to your suggestions , lukas
it is well known that under ch every totally-disconnected compact f-space of weight at most <m> \omega _ 1 </m> can be embedded into the remainder <m> \omega ^ * = \beta \omega \setminus \omega </m> of the cech-stone compactification of <m> \omega </m> . my first two questions are as follows : question 1 : under which other axioms -LRB- or weaker : in which models of set theory -RRB- does this fact also hold ? what are known consistent counter-examples to this fact ? question 2 : can this fact be consistently generalised to higher weights , e.g. under gch ? my last question concerns embedding of some special separable spaces into <m> \beta \omega </m> . question 3 : let <m> \kappa </m> be an infinite cardinal number and <m> A </m> a closed separable subspace of <m> \beta \kappa </m> , where <m> \kappa </m> is endowed with the discrete topology . can <m> A </m> always be embedded into the space <m> \beta \omega </m> ? and what in the case when <m> A </m> is countable but not necessarily closed in <m> \beta \kappa </m> ? thank you in advance for the answers or even useful hints !
whenever <m> M </m> is some fine-structural <m> L </m> - like model we can prove the implication <m> V = M \Rightarrow \textsf { G C H } </m> . for <m> L </m> this is due to gödel , and for the modern extender models it follows simply by construction . the most recent direction in the inner model programme searches for fine-structural models of the form <m> \textsf { H O D } ^ N </m> with <m> N </m> some `` nice '' model -LRB- most recently this includes <m> N = M _ n ( x , g ) </m> for a turing cone of reals <m> x </m> and <m> g </m> generic for making its least <m> N </m> - inaccessible countable -RRB- . my question is then whether <m> V = \textsf { H O D } \Rightarrow \textsf { G C H } </m> has been shown to be unprovable in general -LRB- modulo large cardinals of course -RRB- ? is there some pathological <m> \textsf { H O D } </m> which `` obviously '' does n't satisfy <m> \textsf { G C H } </m> ? also , i 'm not even sure if <m> \textsf { H O D } ^ { \textsf { H O D } ^ N } = \textsf { H O D } ^ N </m> holds for these models , as this -LRB- apparently -RRB- does n't hold in general .

the <m> T \bar { T } </m> deformation is based on the original work of zamolochikov -LSB- 1 -RSB- explored deformations of two-dimensional conformal field theories -LRB- cft -RRB- by an operator that is quadratic in the stress-energy tensor , called the <m> T \bar { T } </m> operator . zamolodchikov -LSB- 1 -RSB- obtained analytic results for the expectation value of the operator , using the complex coordinates <m> z = x + i t </m> and <m> \bar z = x - i t </m> to express the 2d cft coordinates :
