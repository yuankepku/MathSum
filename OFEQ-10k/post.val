i want to study the space <m> Y </m> of all un-ordered <m> d </m> - tuples of points on <m> \mathbb P ^ 1 </m> . by considering the space <m> V _ d </m> of homogeneous polynomials of degree <m> d </m> in two variables , one may identify <m> Y </m> with <m> \mathbb P ( V _ d ) \equiv \mathbb P ^ d </m> . there is a natural <m> S L _ 2 </m> action on <m> \mathbb P ( V _ d ) \equiv Y </m> via change of coordinates . for simplicity , the field is assumed to be <m> \mathbb C </m> , and let me assume <m> d = 4 </m> in the sequel . i want to study the subspace <m> Y _ s \subset Y </m> consisting of un-ordered 4-tuples of pairwise distinct points . indeed <m> Y _ s </m> is the locus of stable points according to hilbert-mumford criterion . put <m> G = S L _ 2 </m> . denote <m> Y _ { s s } </m> the locus of semi-stable points .
i am curious about how to specify with standard terminology that a certain function is non-periodic , in the following sense : in the simple case of a unary operation <m> f : X \to X </m> , this property would specify that , for all <m> x \in X </m> :
i would be grateful if you could help me with the following question : let <m> n \in \mathbb { N } </m> and <m> k \in \{ 1 , \ldots , n + 1 \} </m> . for every <m> i = 1 , . . . , k </m> let <m> f _ i : \partial _ i \Delta ^ n \rightarrow \partial _ i \Delta ^ n </m> be an orientation preserving diffeomorphism of the i-th face of the standard <m> n </m> - simplex <m> \Delta ^ n </m> . suppose <m> f _ i = f _ j </m> on <m> \partial _ i \Delta ^ n \cap \partial _ j \Delta ^ n </m> for all <m> i , j </m> . does there exist a diffeomorphism <m> f : \Delta ^ n \rightarrow \Delta ^ n </m> restricting to <m> f _ i </m> on <m> \partial _ i \Delta ^ n </m> for every <m> i </m> ? simplices are considered as manifolds with corners . i think i can solve it for <m> k = n + 1 </m> when <m> f _ i </m> are time one flows of some vector fields by reducing to the problem of extending a smooth function from a closed set . however , i am interested in the case when <m> f _ i </m> are arbitrary diffeomorphisms and <m> k = n </m> so that there should not be any topological obstructions for the extension . i do not know how to start proving it except for trying to write down an explicit formula for the extension . thank you very much for your comments .
in jech 's set theory he defines a <m> \kappa </m> - scale as a family of functions <m> \langle f _ \alpha \colon \omega \to \omega | \alpha < \kappa \rangle </m> for which :
i already asked two questions about the moyal <m> \star </m> - product here and here but i think i 'll have a lot more similar questions , so i 'm wondering if anyone can help me with finding some good resources . i 'm interested in the properties of the <m> \star </m> - product based operations and objects , such as -LRB- obviously -RRB- multiplication , division , <m> \star </m> - exponents , <m> \star </m> - logarithms and <m> \star </m> - elementary functions in general . i 'm also interested in <m> \star </m> - based calculus and objects such as <m> \star </m> - determinants . in other words , i 'm looking for results , theorems and techniques related to anything that one would ordinarily find in analysis , but with <m> \star </m> - products instead of usual multiplication . i found several papers/notes by akira yoshioka and they were useful , but i need something that could help me do the dirty work and make some calculations easier . there 's obviously a ton of papers and books about the <m> \star </m> - product in the context of deformation quantization . that 's all great and helpful , but it does n't really go beyond the abstract level into some of the calculations . if you need me to clarify something , please do tell , i 'm not exactly sure how exactly to say what i need , hopefully someone will understand .
it is a matter of checking definitions that the tensor product of presentable <m> \infty </m> - categories restrict to a tensor product between stable presentable <m> \infty </m> - categories ; i was wondering if there is a natural way to classify , or to build , <m> t </m> - structures on the tensor product <m> { \cal C } \otimes { \cal D } </m> in terms of <m> t </m> - structures on <m> \cal C </m> and <m> \cal D </m> . this problem has a 1-dimensional counterpart -LRB- not really 1-1 correspondence of statements and proofs , but . . -RRB- : is there a way to construct a torsion theory on the deligne tensor product of abelian categories -LRB- provided it exists -RRB- , given torsion theories on the factors ?
for which <m> n </m> is there a regular <m> n </m> - simplex with vertices in <m> \mathbb { Z } ^ n </m> -LRB- or equivalently , in <m> \mathbb { Q } ^ n </m> -RRB- ? some easy observations :
hello , i want to ask if anyone can tells us what is known -LRB- consistently -RRB- about <m> D e d ( \kappa ) </m> , <m> \kappa </m> an infinite cardinal . definition if there is a dense linear order w/o endpoints of size <m> \lambda </m> with a dense subset of size <m> \kappa </m> then we write <m> D ( \kappa , \lambda ) </m> . then <m> D e d ( \kappa ) = \sup _ \lambda \{ D ( \kappa , \lambda ) \} </m> . known theorems : -LRB- 1 -RRB- <m> D e d ( \kappa ) \le 2 ^ \kappa </m> and under gch <m> D e d ( \kappa ) </m> is always equal to <m> 2 ^ \kappa </m> . -LRB- 2 -RRB- if <m> \mu </m> is the least cardinal such that <m> \kappa ^ \mu > \kappa </m> , then <m> D ( \kappa , \kappa ^ \mu ) </m> holds , which implies in particular that <m> D e d ( \kappa ) \ge \kappa ^ \mu </m> . questions -LRB- 1 -RRB- can we prove that <m> D e d ( \kappa ) < D e d ( \kappa ) ^ \omega </m> is consistent ? -LRB- 2 -RRB- if <m> \mu </m> a cardinal between <m> \omega </m> and <m> \kappa </m> , can we prove that <m> D e d ( \kappa ) = \kappa ^ \mu </m> is consistent ? note 1 : following keisler <m> D e d ( \kappa ) </m> , <m> D e d ( \kappa ) ^ \omega </m> are two of the six possible `` stability functions '' , the other four being <m> \kappa </m> , <m> \kappa + 2 ^ \omega </m> , <m> \kappa ^ \omega </m> and <m> 2 ^ \kappa </m> . stability functions give us the number of types of a theory <m> T </m> over models of power <m> \kappa </m> . for more on this consult the stability function of a theory by h. jerome keisler , the journal of symbolic logic , vol . 43 , no. 3 -LRB- sep. , 1978 -RRB- , pp. 481-486 note 2 : there is a similar question posted on mathoverflow -LRB- given a cardinal k , what 's the biggest dense linear order with a dense subset of size k ? -RRB- that asks for the consistency of <m> D e d ( \kappa ) < 2 ^ \kappa </m> -LRB- answer is positive -RRB-
let <m> p </m> be a prime number -LRB- maybe generic large odd prime -RRB- . let <m> k </m> be integer with <m> ( k , p ) = 1 </m> . the equation in question is <m> X ^ 2 Y + Y ^ 2 + X = k X Y . </m> in homogeneous form , it is alternating <m> X ^ 2 Y + Y ^ 2 Z + Z ^ 2 X = k X Y Z . </m> the elliptic curve always contain three points -LRB- 0,0,1 -RRB- , -LRB- 1,0,0 -RRB- and -LRB- 0,0,1 -RRB- . my question : is there any formula relating the number of points in <m> \mathbb Z / p \mathbb Z </m> to something else ? <m> \# \{ ( X , Y ) \in ( \mathbb Z / p \mathbb Z ) ^ 2 : X ^ 2 Y + Y ^ 2 Z + Z ^ 2 X = k X Y Z \} = \; ? </m> i am expecting the right-hand side be something related to certain characters either cubic or related to cubic fields -LRB- involving <m> k </m> for sure -RRB- .
let <m> E = E _ n </m> be the <m> n </m> - th morava <m> E </m> - theory and let <m> \{ M _ { I } \} </m> be a tower of generalised moore spectra . then -LRB- see this previous question -RRB- there is a milnor exact sequence <m> 0 \to \varprojlim _ I { } ^ 1 ( E \wedge M _ I ) _ { \ast + 1 } ( X ) \to E _ * ^ \vee X \to \varprojlim _ I ( E \wedge M _ I ) _ * X \to 0 . </m> here we write <m> E _ * ^ \vee X </m> for <m> \pi _ * L _ { K ( n ) } ( E \wedge X ) </m> . the functor <m> \mathcal { K } _ * X : = \varprojlim _ I ( E \wedge M _ I ) _ * X </m> is sometimes called the morava module of <m> X </m> , and seems to have first been introduced by hopkins , mahowald and sadofsky whilst studying the <m> K ( n ) </m> - local picard group . in hopkins-mahowald-sadofksy , under the condition that <m> \mathcal { K } _ * X </m> is finitely-generated , the authors show that the <m> E _ 2 </m> - term of the <m> K ( n ) </m> - local <m> E _ n </m> - based adams spectral sequence can be given by <m> H _ c ^ \ast ( \mathbb { G } _ n , \mathcal { K } _ * X ) </m> , where <m> \mathbb { G } _ n </m> is the <m> n </m> - th -LRB- extended -RRB- morava stabilizer group . it is known that the <m> \varprojlim { } ^ 1 </m> term of the milnor exact sequence vanishes under suitable conditions ; for example if <m> E _ * ^ \vee X </m> is finitely-generated , or pro-free , as an <m> E _ * </m> - module . in these cases then <m> E ^ \vee _ * X \simeq \mathcal { K } _ * X </m> . i suspect that the above spectral sequence should have <m> E _ 2 </m> - term <m> H _ c ^ \ast ( \mathbb { G } _ n , E ^ \vee _ * X ) </m> . this leads to the following question :
a well known isoperimetric inequality for closed curves in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> can be generalized to closed curves in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 n } </m> , see : https://mathoverflow.net/a/321505/121665 . i have two questions :
i would like to calculate picard groups of certain schemes over fields ; i 'm mostly interested in the question whether <m> P i c ( X ) </m> is infinitely <m> l </m> - divisible , i.e. whether <m> P i c ( X ) / l = 0 </m> , <m> l </m> is a prime distinct from the base field characteristic -LRB- the latter could be <m> 0 </m> -RRB- . i would like to have a characterization of this vanishing in terms of etale cohomology of <m> l </m> - torsion sheaves . certainly , <m> P i c ( X ) \cong H ^ 1 _ { e t } ( X , G _ m ) </m> ; yet this only yields an injection of <m> P i c ( X ) / l </m> into <m> H ^ 1 ( X , \mu _ l ) </m> , and i do n't know how to control the cokernel . upd . so , is there a general method that expresses <m> P i c ( X ) / l </m> in terms of all of <m> H ^ i ( X , \mu _ { l ^ n } ) </m> -LRB- for <m> i , n > 0 </m> -RRB- ? what can be said here if <m> X </m> is a variety over an algebraically closed field ?
this question is a more specific version of does there always exist an irreducible representation occurring with multiplicity one when inducing from a closed subgroup to a compact lie group ? . since that question has already been answered , and i think it would be unfair not to accept the answer given there , i decided to ask the new version in a separate question . -LRB- if that is considered bad style , please tell me what to do instead in such a case -RRB- . let <m> K A N </m> be the iwasawa decomposition of a connected real semisimple lie group with finite center , and let <m> M = Z _ K ( A ) </m> , the centralizer of <m> A </m> in <m> K </m> . let <m> \tau </m> be an irreducible -LRB- hence finite-dimensional -RRB- complex <m> M </m> - representation . does there exist an irreducible <m> K </m> - representation <m> \sigma </m> such that <m> \tau </m> occurs with multiplicity one in <m> \sigma | _ M </m> ? by frobenius reciprocity , this is equivalent to the question : does the <m> K </m> - representation <m> \mathrm { I n d } ^ K _ M ( \tau ) </m> contain an irreducible subrepresentation that occurs in it only once ? note that i am not asking for <m> ( K , M ) </m> to be a gelfand pair , meaning that the trivial representation occurs with multiplicity one in <m> \mathrm { I n d } ^ K _ M ( \tau ) </m> , or a strong gelfand pair , meaning that every irreducible representation occurs with multiplicity one in <m> \mathrm { I n d } ^ K _ M ( \tau ) </m> .
the number <m> \pi </m> can be expressed as <m> \pi = \lim _ { n \to \infty } \frac { n \sqrt [ n ] { - 1 } - n } { \sqrt { - 1 } } </m> or more poetically <m> \pi = \frac { \infty \sqrt [ \infty ] { - 1 } - \infty } { \sqrt { - 1 } } </m> . here we choose the principal branch of the root . is there a proof using only roots , without resorting to sines and cosines ? -LRB- note : use of the hyperreals is not required . -RRB- does this formula have historical sources ? feel free to use l'hopital 's rule and taylor formula , too .
in some current work , my co-authors and i had wanted in a certain argument to appeal to <m> \kappa ^ { \lt \kappa } = \kappa </m> in <m> L [ A ] </m> , in a situation where <m> A \subset \kappa </m> and <m> \kappa </m> was weakly inaccessible in <m> V </m> , but <m> \kappa </m> was below the continuum in <m> V </m> -LRB- and so <m> \kappa ^ { \lt \kappa } \neq \kappa </m> in <m> V </m> -RRB- . but we have lost confidence in this statement . is it consistent that there is a counterexample ? question . is it -LRB- relatively -RRB- consistent that <m> \kappa </m> is weakly inaccessible , but there is <m> A \subset \kappa </m> with <m> L [ A ] \models \kappa ^ { \lt \kappa } > \kappa </m> ? the model <m> L [ A ] </m> here is the relative constructible universe , defined as in the constructible universe , but with a predicate for the set <m> A </m> . we had at first thought a condensation argument might show <m> \kappa ^ { \lt \kappa } = \kappa </m> in every <m> L [ A ] </m> , but upon looking at it closely , i ca n't quite make it work . condensation works fine above <m> \kappa </m> , but i do n't see why , for example , every real number in <m> L [ A ] </m> must be added by a stage before <m> \kappa </m> . it would be interesting to me even to resolve the question of how big <m> 2 ^ \omega </m> must be or can be in comparison with <m> \kappa </m> in <m> L [ A ] </m> , where <m> A \subset \kappa </m> and <m> \kappa </m> is a regular limit cardinal in <m> V </m> . -LRB- meanwhile , we 've saved our application by finding another route for our argument that does not rely on this issue . -RRB-
let <m> F _ 2 </m> be the free group of rank 2 . let <m> K \le F _ 2 </m> be a characteristic subgroup , such that <m> G : = F _ 2 / K </m> is finite . do there exist examples of such nonabelian <m> G </m> such that the induced map <m> A u t ( F _ 2 ) \rightarrow A u t ( G ) </m> is surjective ? for example , if <m> C _ n </m> is the cyclic group of order <m> n </m> , then for every <m> n </m> , <m> G = C _ n \times C _ n </m> is an abelian example of such a group . edit : as derek holt pointed out in the comments , <m> C _ n \times C _ n </m> is only an example in the cases <m> n = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 </m> .
suppose we identify <m> \mathbf { F } _ q ^ n </m> with <m> \mathbf { F } _ { q ^ n } </m> . let <m> X _ n </m> be the irreducible hypersurface defined by <m> N x = 1 </m> where <m> N </m> is the norm map . there is an analogous hypersurface <m> X _ { n - 1 } </m> in <m> \mathbf { F } _ q ^ { n - 1 } </m> . embed <m> \mathbf { F } _ q ^ { n - 1 } </m> in <m> \mathbf { F } _ q ^ n </m> via your favourite linear map , so that <m> X _ { n - 1 } </m> becomes a codimension-2 variety in <m> \mathbf { F } _ q ^ n </m> . will <m> X _ n \cap X _ { n - 1 } </m> be nonempty ? morally i think that <m> X _ n \cap X _ { n - 1 } </m> ought to be an irreducible variety of codimension <m> 3 </m> , which should therefore contain lots of points by lang -- weil provided <m> n \geq 4 </m> . but i do n't know how to rule out <m> X _ n \cap X _ { n - 1 } </m> being reducible . algebraic geometry is very far from my usual skill set , so please have mercy on me if this question is dumb .
-LRB- originally asked at https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2399091/restricted-representations-and-irreducibility-in-sl-2q -RRB- i 'm working through the fulton-harris ad-hoc method of constructing the character table of <m> S L _ 2 ( q ) </m> -LRB- for <m> q </m> an odd prime power -RRB- , <m> \S </m> 5.2 for reference . i am at a point where we are considering representations of <m> G L _ 2 ( q ) </m> , and how they decompose on restriction to a subgroup of index 2 -LRB- specifically the subgroup of elements with square determinant , which we will call <m> H </m> -RRB- . we then consider the further restriction from this subgroup to <m> S L _ 2 ( q ) </m> . i understand almost everything . there are two irreducible representations of <m> G L _ 2 ( q ) </m> , say <m> W , X </m> , that each split into a direct sum of irreducible representations of <m> H </m> : <m> \ \ W | _ { H } = W ' \oplus W ' ' </m> , <m> X | _ H = X ' \oplus X ' ' </m> . we know the dimensions of these representations - each is half the dimension of the larger rep. now , we have classified all irreducible representations of <m> S L _ 2 ( q ) </m> except 4 , whose dimensions are known to be the same as <m> W ' , W ' ' , X ' , X ' ' </m> . the book then claims -LRB- bottom of page 72 -RRB- : `` this shows that these representations -LRB- <m> W ' , W ' ' , X ' , X ' ' </m> -RRB- stay irreducible on restriction from <m> H </m> to <m> S L _ 2 ( q ) </m> . '' i 'm confused as to why they make this assumption - or am i overlooking something obvious ? thanks in advance .
let me start by recalling some basic definitions -LRB- just for the sake of avoiding misunderstandings due to the vocabulary of the post -RRB- . basically following some ideas of w. lawvere -LRB- but not his terminology -RRB- , we let a semimetric on a set <m> X </m> be a function <m> d : X \times X \to [ 0 , \infty ] </m> such that <m> d ( x , x ) = 0 </m> and <m> d ( x , z ) \le d ( x , y ) + d ( y , z ) </m> for all <m> x , y , z \in X </m> . exactly as with `` classical '' metrics , <m> d </m> induces a topology on <m> X </m> , which we call the canonical topology of <m> d </m> , having as a base the sets <m> \{ y \in X : d ( x , y ) < r \} </m> as <m> x </m> ranges over <m> X </m> and <m> r </m> over <m> \mathbf R ^ + </m> . next , we take a topological monoid to be , as usual , a pair <m> ( \mathbb M , \tau ) </m> consisting of a -LRB- multiplicatively written -RRB- monoid <m> \mathbb M = ( M , \cdot ) </m> and a topology <m> \tau </m> on <m> M </m> such that <m> \cdot </m> is continuous -LSB- ... -RSB- in the expected sense . finally , if <m> \mathbb M = ( M , \cdot ) </m> is a monoid and <m> d </m> is a semimetric on <m> M </m> , we say that <m> d </m> is : right subinvariant -LRB- in <m> \mathbb M </m> -RRB- if <m> d ( x z , y z ) \le d ( x , y ) </m> for all <m> x , y , z \in M </m> ; left subinvariant -LRB- in <m> \mathbb M </m> -RRB- if it is right subinvariant in the dual of <m> \mathbb M </m> ; and subinvariant -LRB- in <m> \mathbb M </m> -RRB- if it is both right and left subinvariant . with all of this in mind , what is known about the following question ?
for an uncountable cardinal <m> \kappa </m> , we are interested in the least size of a cofinal subset of the partial order <m> ( [ \kappa ] ^ \omega , \subseteq ) </m> . it is obvious that this cofinality is at least <m> \kappa </m> and a rather simple induction shows that <m> c o f ( [ \aleph _ n ] ^ \omega , \subseteq ) = \aleph _ n </m> for each natural number <m> n \geq 1 </m> . what is known in <m> Z F C </m> for bigger cardinals ? also i am intrigued by the following statement made by alan dow in efimov spaces and the splitting number , topology proc . -LRB- 2005 -RRB- :
suppose i am given two <m> E _ 2 </m> - ring spectra <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> and a morphism of <m> E _ 2 </m> - rings <m> \phi : A \to B </m> . then i have <m> E _ 1 </m> - monoidal categories of modules <m> L M o d _ A </m> and <m> L M o d _ B </m> . moreover i have morphisms <m> F : L M o d _ A \to L M o d _ B </m> and <m> U : L M o d _ B \to L M o d _ A </m> where by <m> F </m> i mean the extension of scalars functor given by <m> - \otimes _ A B </m> and by <m> U </m> i mean the functor that for a given <m> B </m> - module <m> M </m> imbues it with the <m> A </m> - module structure given by <m> M \otimes A \overset { 1 \otimes \phi } \to M \otimes B \to M </m> . since <m> L M o d _ A </m> and <m> L M o d _ B </m> are monoidal , i can talk about algebras therein . is it the case that the functors <m> F </m> and <m> U </m> preserve this monoidal structure ? if so , is there a reference for this fact within lurie 's <m> \infty </m> - categorical framework ? i should maybe mention that lurie remarks that the functor <m> F </m> defined above is monoidal in remark 6.5 of dag vii .
we assume that <m> G </m> is a finite extension of the discrete heisenberg group <m> H _ 3 ( \Bbb Z ) </m> , that is , <m> 1 \rightarrow H _ 3 ( \Bbb Z ) \rightarrow G \rightarrow F \rightarrow 1 </m> where <m> F </m> is a finite group . is it possible that <m> G </m> is a perfect group ? this question is also posted here .
is there a reason we consider <m> \infty </m> - categories to be the <m> \omega ^ { t h } </m> step in the 2-internalization inside cat -LRB- or enrichment over cat if you prefer -RRB- * process made invertible above some finite ordinal , and do n't continue on to higher steps in the recursion ? is there nothing to be gained , or is the <m> \omega ^ { t h } </m> step already mysterious enough that going further is foolhardy ? for example , it seems -LRB- very naively -RRB- that something like a <m> ( \omega _ 1 , \omega ) </m> - category or higher categories defined up to large cardinals that become invertible at smaller large cardinals might be interesting , or in a <m> \neg C H </m> universe we could ask about <m> ( \omega _ 1 , \mathfrak { c } ) </m> - categories and the like . my apologies if this question is trivial , but i could n't find a discussion/explanation in the literature .

i 'm actually interested in a slightly smaller quantity , but i 'm willing to accept the following simplification , especially if there are small error terms . let 's start with <m> n \gt 1 </m> , euler 's totient <m> \phi ( n ) </m> , and <m> f ( n ) = \sum _ { d \gt 1 , d | n } \frac { \phi ( d ) } { \log d } . </m> i can use obvious estimates to get <m> n \gt f ( n ) \geq ( n - 1 ) / \log n </m> . i hope that indeed there is an absolute -LRB- independent of <m> n </m> -RRB- constant <m> C \lt 2 </m> so that also <m> f ( n ) \lt C n / \log n </m> . the first question then is if my hope can be realized . does such a <m> C \lt 2 </m> exist , and what is -LRB- a good estimate of -RRB- its value if it does ? now for a fixed <m> n </m> i am actually dealing with bounded quantities <m> b _ d </m> and other quantities <m> c _ d </m> -LRB- which may also depend on <m> n </m> but let 's ignore that -RRB- which i am willing to upper bound by <m> b </m> and lower bound by <m> c \geq 1 </m> to get the next approximation <m> g ( n ) = \sum _ { 1 \lt d , d | n } \frac { \phi ( d ) + b } { \log ( c d + 1 ) } </m> where now if it is easier you can add a <m> d = 1 </m> term with numerator <m> 0 </m> . do we have a good value of <m> C </m> corresponding to <m> g ( n ) \lt C n / \log n </m> ? something that would be really nice for my target function -LRB- of which <m> g ( n ) </m> can be a rough upper bound -RRB- is <m> g ( n ) \lt n / ( \log n - B ) </m> for sufficiently large <m> n </m> and some positive constant <m> B </m> . is this possible ? it is tempting to use moebius inversion to solve this . i am primarily interested in explicit bounds more than exact reformulation though . is there a nice way to see how to use mobius inversion here ? -LRB- i am reading some of the posts on inversion , but am concerned about the size of the error . the usual examples do not have a log term , and i do n't know yet how much that changes things . -RRB- while i want answers to the above questions , i am willing to accept an answer to the following meta-question : how do i search on this site and others for terms like those used to define <m> f ( n ) </m> and <m> g ( n ) </m> ? gerhard `` hoping to add some knowledge '' paseman , 2015.11.16
we 've recently seen this question : can the number of solutions <m> a b ( a + b + 1 ) = n </m> for <m> a , b , n \in \mathbb { Z } </m> be unbounded as <m> n </m> varies ? it appears initially plausible that the answer is yes , but evidently there are good reasons to believe that the answer might be no . the same question and lack of certainty applies equally to <m> a b ( a + b - 1 ) = n . </m> i wonder about the analogous situation with <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> replaced by <m> \mathbb { Z } [ t ] </m>
let <m> R </m> be a right -LRB- and left -RRB- noetherian ring and <m> T = R [ x ] </m> its polynomial ring . it was shown by stafford that the set <m> S = \{ f \in T \: | \: f \text { m o n i c } \} </m> is a right denominator set . so my question is , if <m> g \in S </m> , then is <m> G = \{ g ^ a \: | \: a \geq 0 \} </m> a right denominator set also ? if <m> t \in T </m> and <m> g ^ i </m> then i want to show <m> t G \cap g ^ i T \neq \emptyset </m> . as <m> g ^ i \in S </m> then i know there exists some <m> t ^ \prime \in T </m> and <m> f \in S </m> such that <m> g ^ i t ^ \prime = t f </m> . so the question then becomes , does <m> f = g ^ j </m> for some <m> j \geq 0 </m> ? edit : i thought of using the following result : if <m> A \subset B </m> is a multiplicative subset of a ring <m> B </m> such that <m> a B </m> is a two-sided ideal for any <m> a \in A </m> , then <m> A </m> is a right permutable set . now , for <m> g ^ i \in G </m> it is clear that <m> g ^ i T </m> is right ideal of <m> T </m> . so , let <m> t \in T </m> then <m> t g ^ i S \cap g ^ i T \neq \emptyset </m> , i.e. for some <m> s \in S </m> and <m> t ^ \prime \in T </m> we have <m> t g ^ i s = g ^ i t ^ \prime </m> . this seems promising but then i am unsure of how to proceed . i need to show <m> t g ^ i \bar { t } \in g ^ i T </m> but do we need <m> \bar { t } = s \bar { t } ^ \prime </m> ?
on the first page of chapter 1 of rieffel 's deformation quantization for actions of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { d } </m> , rieffel defines a family of seminorms on the space <m> A ^ { \infty } </m> of smooth vectors of a fréchet space <m> A </m> , for some action <m> \alpha </m> of the lie group <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { d } </m> on <m> A </m> , as follows . suppose we already have a family <m> ( \| \cdot \| _ { i } ) _ { i \in \mathbb { N } } </m> of seminorms on <m> A </m> that determine its topology . choose a basis <m> \lbrace X _ { 1 } , \ldots , X _ { d } \rbrace </m> of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { d } </m> . then for each <m> k \in \lbrace 1 , \ldots , d \rbrace </m> , let <m> \alpha _ { X _ { k } } </m> denote the operator of partial differentiation on <m> A ^ { \infty } </m> in the direction of <m> X _ { k } </m> ; we thus identify <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { d } </m> with its lie algebra in the usual way . for convenience , denote <m> \alpha _ { X _ { k } } </m> simply by <m> \partial _ { k } </m> . next , for any multi-index <m> \mu = ( \mu _ { 1 } , \ldots , \mu _ { d } ) \in \mathbb { N } _ { 0 } ^ { d } </m> , let <m> \partial ^ { \mu } </m> denote the higher-order partial derivative <m> \partial _ { 1 } ^ { \mu _ { 1 } } \cdots \partial _ { d } ^ { \mu _ { d } } </m> . then equip <m> A ^ { \infty } </m> with the seminorms <m> \forall ( j , k ) \in \mathbb { N } \times \lbrace 1 , \ldots , d \rbrace ~ ~ \& ~ ~ \forall a \in A ^ { \infty } : \quad \| a \| _ { j , k } \stackrel { \text { d e f } } { = } \sup _ { 1 \leq i \leq j } \sum _ { | \mu | \leq k } \frac { \| \partial ^ { \mu } a \| _ { i } } { \mu ! } , </m> where <m> | \mu | \stackrel { \text { d e f } } { = } \mu _ { 1 } + \cdots + \mu _ { d } </m> and <m> \mu ! \stackrel { \text { d e f } } { = } \mu _ { 1 } ! \cdots \mu _ { d } ! </m> . my question is : as we are applying partial derivatives to <m> a \in A ^ { \infty } </m> , are we identifying <m> a </m> with the function <m> f _ { a } : \mathbb { R } ^ { d } \rightarrow A </m> defined by <m> { f _ { a } } ( \mathbf { x } ) \stackrel { \text { d e f } } { = } \alpha ( \mathbf { x } , a ) </m> ? thank you very much in advance !
this is a sequel of this question where i asked for which positive integer <m> n </m> the set of primes of the former <m> x ^ 2 + n y ^ 2 </m> was defined by congruences -LRB- a set of primes <m> P </m> is defined by congruences if there is a positive integer <m> d </m> and a subset <m> A </m> of <m> \mathbb { Z } / d \mathbb { Z } </m> such that a prime <m> p </m> is in <m> P </m> if and only if <m> p </m> mod <m> d </m> is in <m> A </m> , up to a finite number of exceptions -RRB- . i was taught there that the answer was `` exactly when <m> n </m> is idoneal '' , that there is finitely many idoneal numbers , and that all are known but perhaps one .
it is well known that every <m> \mathbf { \Pi } ^ 1 _ 1 </m> - set is a union of <m> \aleph _ 1 </m> - many borel sets . i wonder whether it can be improved under certain reasonable set theory axioms assumption . for example , assuming <m> Z F C + C H </m> , then it is trivially true that every set is a union of <m> \aleph _ 1 </m> - many closed sets . but this seems heavily depends on <m> C H </m> since if <m> Z F C + \neg C H + M A </m> , then there is a lightface <m> \Pi ^ 0 _ 2 </m> - set which can not be a union of <m> \aleph _ 1 </m> - many closed sets . so my question is : is it consistent with <m> Z F C + \neg C H </m> that every <m> \mathbf { \Pi } ^ 1 _ 1 </m> - set is a union of <m> \aleph _ 1 </m> - many closed sets ?
let <m> \Lambda </m> be an <m> n </m> dimensional sublattice of the integer lattice <m> \mathbb { Z } ^ n </m> . the quotient <m> \mathbb { Z } ^ n / \Lambda </m> has order <m> \sqrt { \det { \Lambda } } </m> . what is the best/standard way to compute a set of coset representatives for this quotient ? edit : i initially forgot to take the square root of <m> \det { \Lambda } </m> , which is likely the reason for kcronrad 's initial comment .
let <m> R </m> be a commutative ring . if i am not mistaken , there is the following fact :
in higher algebra lemma 6.1.6.3 , most of the proof is pretty straightforward , but after thinking i understood it all correctly , i realized i had a gap in my understanding . suppose we have a homotopy cartesian square of <m> \infty </m> - categories -LRB- the lemma has these as kan complexes , but i think this is irrelevant to my question here -RRB- <m> \begin {matrix} X ' & \xrightarrow { f ' } & Y ' \\ \downarrow ^ { g _ X } & & \downarrow ^ { g _ Y } \\ X & \xrightarrow { f } & Y \end {matrix} </m> and for simplicity , <m> C </m> is an <m> \infty </m> - category with enough limits for <m> f ^ * </m> and <m> f ' ^ * </m> to admit right adjoints . in the proposition -LRB- which has more conditions , though they are irrelevant to this question -RRB- , we want to see if the beck-chevalley transformation <m> g ^ * _ Y f _ * \to f ' _ * f ' ^ * g _ Y ^ * f _ * \simeq f ' _ * g _ X ^ * f ^ * f _ * \to f ' _ * g _ X ^ * </m> is an is an equivalence . lurie suggests we prove this by pointwise evaluation on a functor <m> F : X \to C </m> and an object <m> y </m> of <m> Y ' </m> of the beck-chevalley transformation as the induced map <m> \operatorname { l i m } ( F | X \times _ Y Y _ { g _ Y ( y ) / } ) \to \operatorname { l i m } ( F | X ' \times _ Y ' Y ' _ { y / } ) . </m> the trouble is , it 's not clear to me why this map , induced by the diagram <m> \begin {matrix} X ' & \to & Y ' & \leftarrow & Y ' _ { y / } \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow \\ X & \to & Y & \leftarrow & Y _ { g _ Y ( y ) / } \end {matrix} </m> is homotopic to the component of the beck-chevalley map at <m> F </m> and <m> y </m> . i tried evaluating the intermediate terms , but they are huge and messy , and i ca n't find a reference showing that they are indeed homotopic . is the proof easy ? does anybody have a reference ? edit : i think this is related to the proof of 4.3.3 in ambidexterity paper of lurie and hopkins . it looks like he uses cartesianness of the square there to identify -LRB- the adjuncts of -RRB- these maps -LRB- in the dual case of left kan extensions -RRB- , so i have added a cartesianness condition .
i 'm interested in filling the details of the well known computation , via ahss of <m> E ^ * ( \mathbb { C } P ^ n ) </m> ; where <m> ( E , x _ E ) </m> is an oriented spectrum . it is supposed to be easy , yet every proof i 've read skip a -LRB- obvious ? -RRB- detail which now i want to address . let <m> i _ n \colon \mathbb { C } P ^ n \to \mathbb { C } P ^ { \infty } </m> be the usual inclusion .

we know that since <m> P G L _ 2 ( q ) </m> is a subgroup of <m> P \Gamma L _ 2 ( q ) </m> and <m> P G L _ 2 ( q ) </m> is 2-transitive on the projective line , so <m> P \Gamma L _ 2 ( q ) </m> is 2-transitive also . now , does it make sense to find the conditions in which <m> P \Gamma L _ 2 ( q ) </m> is 4-transitive group ? we know that the only 4-transitive groups are the symmetric groups <m> S _ n </m> for <m> n > 4 </m> , the alternating groups <m> A _ n </m> for <m> n > 6 </m> , and the mathieu groups <m> M _ { 2 4 } </m> , <m> M _ { 2 3 } </m> , <m> M _ { 1 2 } </m> and the <m> M _ { 1 1 } </m> .
i 'm currently reading a review article called dynamical algebraic combinatorics : promotion , rowmotion , and resonance by jessica striker . in this article , striker writes that there is a `` nice '' bijection between the set of noncrossing matchings of <m> 2 b </m> points and <m> S Y T ( 2 \times b ) </m> , the set of standard young tableaux of size <m> 2 \times b </m> . here are two examples of the bijection : unfortunately , i can not seem to understand how exactly this bijection works . as can be seen in the figure , given any pair <m> ( i , j ) </m> with <m> i < j </m> in the noncrossing matching , we want to map this to this to a tableau with <m> i </m> on the first row and <m> j </m> on the second row . but it is neither clear to me why this map should be injective nor surjective .

among the collections of the open problems of paul erdős on the website of professor fan chung , there is one called `` number of triangle-free graphs '' . http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~erdosproblems/erdos/newproblems/numberoftrianglefreegraphs.html open problem : determine or estimate the number of maximal triangle-free graphs on <m> n </m> vertices . is any one working on this problem ? any known related results ? now i am considering about using a `` connection game '' method to solve this problem : given a set of <m> n </m> players , each one chooses to connect to other nodes , if any two neighbors of it connect a new edge -LRB- which means there would form a triangle -RRB- , it has to choose delete either edges with those two neighbors . then the question is how many different topology connections does it have ? any comments on this method ?

i am consulting the recent paper `` on the integrality of modular symbols and kato 's euler system for elliptic curves '' by chris wuthrich . but i am confused regarding the definition of semistable reduction at a prime <m> p </m> of an elliptic curve due to the following two definitions - 1 -RRB- on page 196 of `` arithmetic of elliptic curves '' by silverman , it is given that multiplicative reduction is same as semistable reduction . 2 -RRB- on page 335 of the book `` elliptic curves '' by d husemoeller , the author says an elliptic curve <m> E </m> has semistable reduction at a prime <m> p </m> if and only if <m> p ^ 2 </m> does not divide the conductor of the curve . so kindly suggest the correct definition of semistable reduction of an elliptic curve at a prime <m> p </m> .

the values of riemann 's function at the integers have been extensively studied . i was wondering , is there anything interesting known -LRB- or conjectured -RRB- to happen arithmetically outside the real line -LRB- and outside of critical strip -RRB- ? conjectured irrationality , mysteriously neat expressions or something of the like . edit . since the question is necessarily broad , i 'll try to make it a bit more clear : is there any <m> s \in \mathbb { C } </m> , <m> \mathfrak { I } ( s ) \neq 0 </m> , <m> \mathfrak { R } ( s ) > 1 </m> such that <m> s </m> or its real/imaginary components are suspected to be transcendental , or to be give any new arithmetical information about <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> ?
my adviser is out of town and there is a comment in the van wesep paper `` wadge degrees and descriptive set theory '' that i ca n't figure out . work in zf + ad throughout . as stated in the title , the comment says that for n odd , the -LRB- order type of the -RRB- <m> \bf \Delta ^ 1 _ n </m> wadge degrees are less that <m> \bf \delta ^ 1 _ { n + 1 } </m> and van wesep includes the comment '' -LRB- prewellorder the codes of of <m> \bf \Delta ^ 1 _ n </m> sets as preimages of initial segments of a <m> \bf \Pi ^ 1 _ n </m> - prewellordered complete <m> \bf \Pi ^ 1 _ n </m> set -RRB- '' . this is easy enough , let u be some <m> \bf \Pi ^ 1 _ n </m> complete set with corresponding well-order <m> \phi </m> . for x and y codes of <m> \bf \Delta ^ 1 _ n </m> sets , let <m> x \leq y </m> iff <m> \exists w \in U _ x </m> such that -LRB- x , w -RRB- is <m> \leq _ \phi </m> greater than all -LRB- y , z -RRB- such that <m> z \in U _ y </m> . this will be defined for all such x , y because of the boundedness principle . now , in order to finish the proof , one must show that for <m> \bf \Delta ^ 1 _ n </m> codes x , y , <m> U _ y < _ w U _ x \rightarrow y < x </m> . while this seems intuitively true -LRB- if <m> y < x </m> we can compute <m> U _ y </m> from <m> U _ x </m> using <m> < _ \phi </m> -RRB- , i can not prove this fact . i believe this is the correct approach . one alternative way of defining <m> \leq </m> would be <m> y \leq x </m> iff <m> ( < _ \phi | U _ y ) \leq </m> -LRB- as an order type -RRB- <m> ( < _ \phi | U _ x ) </m> or something along those lines . but , this seems less hopeful . any help would be greatly appreciated . i apologize if this question is too basic for this website . , cody
suppose <m> P = L \ltimes U </m> is an <m> F </m> - stable parabolic subgroup of a finite group of lie type <m> G </m> , with <m> F </m> - stable levi complement <m> L </m> . here <m> F </m> is a frobenius endomorphism , and <m> G ^ F </m> is the subgroup of fixed points under <m> F </m> , etc. let <m> \Lambda </m> be a commutative ring of some appropriate characteristic . the parabolic induction and restriction functors can defined as <m> R _ { L \subset P } ^ G : \Lambda L ^ F \text { - m o d } \to \Lambda G ^ F \text { - m o d } : M \mapsto \Lambda G ^ F / U ^ F \otimes _ { \Lambda L ^ F } M </m> and <m> ^ \ast R ^ G _ { L \subset P } \colon \Lambda G ^ F \text { - m o d } \to \Lambda L ^ F \text { - m o d } : N \mapsto \hom _ { \Lambda G ^ F } ( \Lambda G ^ F / U ^ F , N ) . </m> in certain situations it is more convenient to change which one is a tensor functor , and which is a hom functor , as follows : <m> R _ { L \subset P } ^ G = \hom _ { \Lambda L ^ F } ( \Lambda U ^ F / G ^ F , - ) </m> and <m> ^ \ast R ^ G _ { L \subset P } = \Lambda U ^ F / G ^ F \otimes _ { \Lambda G ^ F } - . </m> on the level of elements , is there an explicit isomorphism between the two functors for induction , and for restriction ?
let <m> X </m> be a set . one can define a non-symmetric colored version of the non-unital <m> A _ \infty </m> operad as follows . the set of colors is the set of ordered pairs in <m> X </m> . let <m> ( x _ 1 , y _ 1 ) , \dots , ( x _ n , y _ n ) </m> be an ordered list of <m> n \geq 2 </m> colors . the space of <m> n </m> - ary operations with domain <m> ( x _ 1 , y _ 1 ) , \dots , ( x _ n , y _ n ) </m> and codomain <m> ( x , y ) </m> is empty unless <m> x = x _ 1 </m> , <m> y = y _ n </m> , and <m> y _ i = x _ { i + 1 } </m> for <m> i = 1 , \dots , n - 1 </m> . when the colors do satisfy these relations , the space of colors is the finite cell complex whose cells are labeled by planar rooted trees , each vertex having at least two inputs -LRB- `` rooted '' means each vertex has a unique output , namely the half-edge connecting the vertex towards the root -RRB- , and whose regions are labeled , in left-to-right order along the top -LRB- the `` leaf '' end of the planar tree -RRB- , by the colors <m> x = x _ 1 , y _ 1 = x _ 2 , \dots , y _ n = y </m> . the dimension of a cell is <m> \sum _ v ( \deg v - 2 ) </m> , where the sum ranges over the vertices in the tree , and <m> \deg v </m> is the number of inputs to the vertex <m> v </m> . the boundary of a cell consists of all cells that can be formed by blowing up a vertex into two vertices . the combinatorics of this `` boundary '' operation are precisely described by some stasheff polytopes , and so is a sphere . composition in this colored operad is by grafting of trees : ignoring the boundary operation , this colored operad is free on the trees with one vertex . so i believe that this colored operad is cofibrant and has the homotopy type of the colored operad whose algebras set are categories . a representation of this colored operad is nothing but an <m> A _ \infty </m> category with objects indexed by <m> X </m> . let <m> \mathcal S </m> be a cartesian-closed presentable <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - category . i 'm pretty sure that every <m> A _ \infty </m> category in <m> \mathcal S </m> is also an <m> \mathcal S </m> - enriched <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - category . is the opposite true ? i.e. is the inclusion of <m> A _ \infty </m> categories among all <m> \mathcal S </m> - enriched categories a homotopy equivalence ? my impression from bergner , models for <m> ( , n ) </m> - categories and the cobordism hypothesis , mathematical foundations of quantum field theory and perturbative string theory , 2011 was that at least at the time this was expected but unknown . but my impression could be off , or there could be new results in the intervening years , or i could have misunderstood what an '' <m> A _ \infty </m> category '' is . assuming that the answer is -LRB- at least after necessary corrections have been made to my definition -RRB- `` it 's not yet known '' : where does the difficulty lie ?
if i recall correctly from a lecture i attended the last year we have that <m> M C G ( \mathbb { S ^ 2 } ) \simeq \frac { \mathbb { Z } } { 2 \mathbb { Z } } </m> by smale in the 60 ' and <m> M C G ( \mathbb { S ^ 3 } ) \simeq \frac { \mathbb { Z } } { 2 \mathbb { Z } } </m> as well for a result by hatcher in the 80 ' . i can not find any reference though , especially for the last result -LRB- maybe i recall wrong -RRB- . here i am taking as definition of the <m> M C G </m> the group of diffeomorphism modulo smooth isotopies . moreover , i wonder what we know about mapping class groups of spheres in higher dimension and other manifolds in general . for sure <m> M C G ( \mathbb { S } ^ 6 ) </m> ca n't be just <m> \frac { \mathbb { Z } } { 2 \mathbb { Z } } </m> because of the exotic <m> \mathbb { S } ^ 7 </m> , am i right ?
a commutative ring with unity is called pm-ring if every prime ideal is contained in a unique maximal ideal . in -LSB- dmo71 -RSB- , it is shown that pm-rings are characterized by the fact that <m> \operatorname { m a x S p e c } R </m> -LRB- the set of all maximal ideals under zariski subspace topology -RRB- is a retract of <m> \operatorname { S p e c } R </m> , and in this case , the unique retraction is given by <m> u : \operatorname { S p e c } R \to \operatorname { m a x S p e c } R </m> , <m> u ( P ) </m> is the unique maximal ideal containing <m> P \in \operatorname { S p e c } R </m> . it can moreover be shown that for pm-rings , this retract is actually also a deformation retract , because <m> H : \operatorname { S p e c } R \times [ 0 , 1 ] \to \operatorname { S p e c } R </m> given by <m> H ( P , t ) = P , \forall t \in [ 0 , 1 ) </m> and <m> H ( P , 1 ) = u ( P ) </m> is continuous , so gives a homotopy between <m> i \circ u </m> and <m> I d _ { \operatorname { S p e c } R } </m> , where <m> i : \operatorname { m a x S p e c } R \to \operatorname { S p e c } R </m> is the inclusion map . so the questions i want to ask are the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- can we characterize -LRB- possibly algebraic characterization -RRB- commutative rings -LRB- with unity -RRB- <m> R </m> such that <m> \operatorname { m a x S p e c } R </m> is homotopy equivalent with <m> \operatorname { S p e c } R </m> ? -LRB- 2 -RRB- can we characterize commutative rings -LRB- with unity -RRB- <m> R </m> , such that <m> i : \operatorname { m a x } \operatorname { S p e c } R \to \operatorname { S p e c } R </m> is a homotopy equivalence i.e. there exists a map <m> g : \operatorname { S p e c } R \to \operatorname { m a x } \operatorname { S p e c } R </m> such that <m> i \circ g </m> and <m> g \circ i </m> are homotopic to the respective identity maps ? as noted , pm-rings are definitely in both the class , but what are all such rings ? even if we ca n't say what are all such rings , can we atleast find class of rings for each case -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- which are not necessarily pm-rings ?

in the scad paper by fan and li -LRB- 2001 -RRB- , there exist two forms of penalized least squares as follows : <m> \frac { 1 } { 2 } \left \| y - X \beta \right \| ^ 2 + \lambda \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { d } p _ j ( \left | \beta _ j \right | ) , </m> <m> \frac { 1 } { 2 } ( y - X \beta ) ^ T ( y - X \beta ) + n \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { d } p _ \lambda ( \left | \beta _ j \right | ) , </m> which correspond to the formula -LRB- 2.2 -RRB- and -LRB- 3.1 -RRB- in the paper respectively . why does the second one multiply the penalty by <m> n </m> -LRB- the number of the observation -RRB- ? similarly , the penalized likelihood function -LRB- 3.3 -RRB- also presents penalty with multiplication factor <m> n </m> as follows : <m> - \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } l _ i ( g ( x _ i ^ T \beta ) , y _ i ) + n \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { d } p _ \lambda ( \left | \beta _ j \right | ) . </m> furthermore , the lasso paper -LRB- tibshirani , 1996 -RRB- does n't contain <m> n </m> in the penalty . why to multiply the penalty by <m> n </m> in the penalized least squares and likelihood ? what impact does it have on the criterion ?
let <m> P \in \mathbb { R } \lbrack x \rbrack </m> be given . -LRB- in practice , the coefficients could be given as , say , decimals to sufficient precision . -RRB- let <m> M \geq 1 </m> , and let <m> I </m> be an interval in <m> \mathbb { R } / \mathbb { Z } </m> of length <m> \epsilon \ll 1 / M </m> . can we find -LRB- more or less -RRB- quickly the values of <m> m </m> , <m> 1 \leq m \leq M </m> , such that that <m> P ( m ) \in I </m> ? notes : -LRB- a -RRB- for <m> P </m> linear , this is n't hard . let <m> P ( x ) = a _ 1 x + a _ 0 </m> . by dirichlet approximation -LRB- which we can implement quickly using continued fractions -RRB- , there are <m> Q \sim M </m> , <m> q \leq Q </m> , <m> 0 \leq a < q </m> such that <m> a _ 1 = a / q + \beta / q Q </m> , where <m> | \beta | \leq 1 </m> . for <m> P ( m ) \in I </m> to hold , we must have <m> m \equiv a ^ { - 1 } b \mod q </m> , where <m> b </m> is of the form <m> ( \lfloor ( \alpha - a _ 0 ) q \rfloor + c ) \mod q </m> , where <m> \alpha </m> is the midpoint of <m> I </m> -LRB- say -RRB- and <m> c = O ( 1 ) </m> . let <m> 0 \leq r < q </m> be such that <m> r \equiv q ^ { - 1 } b \mod q </m> . then we are tasked with finding <m> k \leq L / q </m> such that <m> P ( k q + r ) \in I </m> . now , <m> P ( k q + r ) \equiv \beta k / Q + a _ 1 r + a _ 0 </m> , and so we must find <m> k \leq L / q \sim Q / q </m> such that <m> \beta k / Q </m> lies in an interval contained in <m> \lbrack 0 , 1 / q \rbrack </m> . this we can do just by division -LRB- over <m> \mathbb { R } </m> -RRB- . -LRB- b -RRB- for <m> P </m> of degree <m> \geq 2 </m> , this can not be very easy : for <m> q </m> an integer , <m> L = q </m> , solving the special case <m> P ( x ) = x ^ 2 / q </m> is equivalent to finding square roots mod <m> q </m> , and that is equivalent to factorizing <m> q </m> . at the same time , i would see any algorithm that works in time <m> O _ \epsilon ( M ^ \epsilon ) </m> as being acceptable , so factorization is n't a hard barrier .
let me first fix some notations . let <m> X = L _ { 1 } ( \mu ) </m> , where <m> \mu </m> is a finite positive measure . let <m> A </m> be a bounded subset of <m> X </m> . set <m> \omega ( A ) = \inf \{ \widehat { d } ( A , K ) : \emptyset \neq K \subset X </m> is weakly compact <m> \} . </m> where <m> \widehat { d } ( A , K ) = \sup \{ d ( f , K ) : f \in A \} . </m> o. f. k. kalenda , h. pfitzner and j. spurny proved the following formula : <m> \omega ( A ) = \inf _ { c > 0 } \sup _ { f \in A } \int ( | f | - c ) ^ { + } d \mu </m> it is easy to verify that <m> \int ( | f | - c ) ^ { + } d \mu = d ( f , c B _ { L _ { \infty } ( \mu ) } ) </m> for every <m> f \in X </m> and every <m> c > 0 </m> . set <m> \iota ( A ) = \sup \{ \limsup _ { n } \sup _ { f \in A } | < x ^ { * } _ { n } , f > | : ( x ^ { * } _ { n } ) _ { n } \in l ^ { w } _ { 1 } ( X ^ { * } ) , ( x ^ { * } _ { n } ) _ { n } \subset B _ { X ^ { * } } \} . </m> my question is : <m> \omega ( A ) \leq \iota ( A ) </m> the purpose of my question is to prove that <m> L _ { 1 } </m> has some quantitative pelczynski 's property <m> ( V ^ { * } ) </m> . thank you !
i am interested in the classifying space <m> B G </m> of a finite group <m> G </m> . a real representation <m> V </m> of <m> G </m> of dimension <m> r </m> defines a real vector bundle over <m> B G </m> of rank <m> r </m> . if the determinant of this representation is trivial , then this bundle is orientable and a choice of orientation determines an euler class <m> e ( V ) \in H ^ r ( B G , \mathbb { Z } ) </m> . do these classes generate <m> H ^ * ( B G , \mathbb { Z } ) </m> as a ring ? this is easy to show when <m> G </m> is abelian . in that case we need only consider <m> G = \mathbb { Z } _ n </m> and the cohomology ring is generated in degree 2 by the euler class of the <m> 2 \pi / n </m> - rotation representation . more generally , for any <m> G </m> , the map <m> H ^ 1 ( B G , S O ( 2 ) ) \to H ^ 2 ( B G , \mathbb { Z } ) </m> is an isomorphism since the latter is torsion and this is a bockstein-type operation . we can consider the element of <m> H ^ 1 ( B G , S O ( 2 ) ) </m> as a homomorphism <m> G \to S O ( 2 ) </m> giving us a 2d representation and it is easy to see from the definition of the bockstein that the above map is the euler class of this representation .
i suspect that many permutation puzzles can be solved in <m> O ( n \log n ) </m> moves , which has led me to the following question/conjecture : suppose that 1 . <m> P _ i </m> for <m> i < k = O ( 1 ) </m> are permutations on an <m> n </m> element set <m> S </m> . 2 . the group <m> G </m> generated by <m> P </m> is transitive . 3 . each <m> P _ i </m> has only <m> O ( 1 ) </m> nontrivial cycles . 4 . for all but <m> O ( 1 ) </m> <m> u S </m> , <m> | \{ v u : i \, ( P _ i ( u ) = v P _ i ( v ) = u ) \} | = 2 </m> 5 . there are <m> i </m> and <m> j </m> such that <m> P _ i </m> , <m> P _ j </m> , <m> P _ i P _ j </m> , <m> P _ i ^ { - 1 } P _ j </m> each move -LRB- i.e. act nontrivially on -RRB- <m> ( n / \log n ) </m> elements . question : is every member of <m> G </m> representable as a product <m> O ( n \log n ) </m> elements of <m> P </m> ? i am also interested in special cases of -LRB- 1 -RRB- - -LRB- 5 -RRB- , and in generalizations to other <m> P </m> . -LRB- 3 -RRB- - -LRB- 4 -RRB- essentially state that <m> P </m> has <m> O ( 1 ) </m> branch points . assuming -LRB- 1 -RRB- - -LRB- 4 -RRB- and that <m> G </m> is not just a cycle , i conjecture that -LRB- 5 -RRB- is both necessary and sufficient , and that more generally , using <m> f ( n ) </m> in place of <m> n / \log n </m> , we get <m> O ( \max ( n ^ 2 / f ( n ) , n \log n ) ) </m> . by a communication complexity -LRB- or distance function -RRB- argument , this is optimal -LRB- but i did not formally prove that <m> G </m> is large enough , and same below -RRB- . by a counting argument , <m> O ( n \log n ) </m> -LRB- if achievable -RRB- is optimal up to a constant factor . conversely , if permutations behave randomly enough , and unless there is some approximate symmetry or slowly varying quantity , then <m> O ( n \log n ) </m> should suffice -LRB- but it is open whether this actually holds for <m> S _ n </m> or <m> A _ n </m> generated by a pair of random permutations -RRB- . a typical example of a slowly varying quantity is <m> _ { u , v } | d ( R ( u ) , R ( v ) ) - d ( T ( u ) , T ( v ) ) | </m> for some distance function <m> d </m> , current sequence of moves/permutation <m> R </m> , and desired permutation <m> T </m> . however , the conditions in the question appear just enough for good mixing behavior . the only primitive groups for the conditions appear to be <m> A _ n </m> and <m> S _ n </m> . however , there are <m> P </m> that preserve antipodal pairs -LRB- or more generally <m> i </m> - tuples for <m> i = O ( 1 ) </m> -RRB- . applications to puzzles permutation groups with a distinguished set of generators can be viewed as puzzles : each element is an instance of the puzzle , and the generators -LRB- such as <m> P _ i </m> above -RRB- are the permitted moves . the directed diameter is the maximum number of moves needed to solve a puzzle , with the undirected diameter also permitting inverse generators -LRB- such as <m> P _ i ^ { - 1 } </m> -RRB- as moves . an example is a hungarian rings puzzle , where <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> are cyclic permutations of length <m> ( n ) </m> that intersect at two points -LRB- implemented mechanically as two interlocking rings filled with balls -RRB- . a positive answer would imply that the puzzle can be solved in <m> O ( n \log n ) </m> moves . another example is the generalized 15 puzzle , which uses pebbles on a graph <m> G </m> with one empty space -LRB- and one pebble on each other vertex -RRB- , with each move moving a pebble to the adjacent empty space . thus , for each location of the empty space , the positions form a group . there are graphs requiring <m> ( n ^ 3 ) </m> moves -LRB- but not more -RRB- , see coordinating pebble motion on graphs , the diameter of permutation groups , and applications . however , a positive answer implies that for every graph <m> G </m> without cycles of length <m> o ( n ) </m> , one can solve a solvable puzzle in <m> ( n ^ 2 \log n ) </m> moves , which is optimal -LRB- if <m> G </m> is also nonseparable and has more than one cycle -RRB- since we take an average of <m> ( n ) </m> moves between branches with <m> O ( 1 ) </m> choices . on a separate note , i do not know whether for graphs with logarithmic diameter , <m> O ( n \log n ) </m> moves suffices . the group structure makes typical permutation puzzles tractable . the decision problem is solvable using schreier -- sims algorithm , and with exception of four mathieu groups , every 4-transitive group includes every even permutation . if for some <m> k </m> , a permutation group is <m> k </m> - transitive -LRB- using <m> O ( t ) </m> moves -RRB- and includes some permutation that moves just <m> k </m> - elements -LRB- using <m> O ( t ) </m> moves -RRB- , then it includes every even permutation -LRB- using <m> O ( t n ) </m> moves , at least if inverses of moves are valid moves -RRB- . in many puzzles , the commutator <m> A B A ^ { - 1 } B ^ { - 1 } </m> moves just a few elements , and -LRB- separately from this -RRB- by relying on elements not moved by <m> A </m> , we can grow chains of elements and get <m> k </m> - transitivity , and typically get a quadratic time solution -LRB- or cubic time for generalized 15 puzzle -RRB- . however , the optimal number of moves can be np hard , so instead , we ask for asymptotic optimality -LRB- for positions that are not easier than random -RRB- up to a constant factor .
i 'm currently reading the book of jacob lurie , ` higher topos theory ' , and i 'm a little confused by the relation between classical topos and <m> \infty </m> - topos : to an <m> \infty </m> - topos i can attach the ordinary topos of its <m> 0 </m> - truncated objects . and to a classical topos i have several way to associate <m> \infty </m> - topos ` above ' it . jacob lurie -LRB- in his book , section 6.4 -RRB- present this relation as similar to the relation between a classical topos and its locale of sub-terminal objects . in this situation , i know i can have plenty of topoi -LRB- a proper class -RRB- that are associated to the same locale , even if this locale is just a point . but i have no idea of what happens in the case of <m> \infty </m> - topos : i have seen that in some cases there might be several non equivalent <m> \infty </m> - topos above a same ordinary topos , but i see them more like `` different ways of doing homotopy theory in the internal logic of <m> X </m> because some classical result of homotopy theory -LRB- like whitehead 's theorem -RRB- may fail in the internal logic '' rather than completely different objects that just share a small property '' -LRB- like the class of topoi whose locale of subterminal objects is reduced to a point is just the class of topos whose internal logic is two-valued -RRB- so for example : are there several -LRB- non equivalent -RRB- <m> \infty </m> - topoi , whose topos of <m> 0 </m> - truncatued objects is the topos of set ? if it 's the case , can i have an example ? are we able to ` classify ' them ?
i am interested in figuring out the following submanifold generator of a <m> P i n ^ + </m> bordism or cobordism group in the dimension 4 , say for a <m> P i n ^ + </m> cobordism group of the classifying space <m> B G = B S U ( 2 ) </m> : <m> \Omega ^ { 4 , \text { P i n } ^ { + } } _ { \text { t o r s } } ( B S U ( 2 ) _ { \text { S p i n } } , U ( 1 ) ) = \text { H o m } ( \Omega ^ { \text { P i n } ^ { + } } _ { 4 , \text { t o r } } ( B S U ( 2 ) ) , U ( 1 ) ) </m> the answer is an abelian group , and it should be a cyclic group of order 4 or of order 8 . my question is what are the submanifold generator of this cobordism group ? i.e. the submanifold generator of this pontryagin-dual of the torsion subgroup of the <m> P i n ^ + </m> bordism group -LRB- dimension 4th -RRB- ?
in financial mathematics , the inverse series of : <m> b ( x ) = - \frac { \log ( 1 - e ^ { - x } ) } { x } </m> is needed in order to perform fast calculation on swaptions for g2 + + calibration model . -LRB- see this post for further references -RRB- . the unique positive solution for equation <m> e ^ { - x } + e ^ { - b x } = 1 </m> implicitly defines <m> x </m> as a function of <m> b </m> . there is no possible explicit solution for <m> x ( b ) </m> , unless when <m> b \in { 0 , 1 / 4 , 1 / 3 , 1 / 2 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } </m> , as it becomes galois solvable . nevertheless , it is always possible to express <m> b ( x ) </m> as above such that the inverse series <m> x ( b ) </m> would provide a solution . i managed to expand x -LRB- b -RRB- up to order 5 as follows : <m> x ( b ) = + \log ( 2 ) - \frac { \log ( 2 ) } { 2 } ( b - 1 ) + \left ( \frac { 1 } { 4 } \log ( 2 ) + \frac { 1 } { 8 } \log ( 2 ) ^ 2 \right ) ( b - 1 ) ^ 2 - \left ( \frac { 1 } { 8 } \log ( 2 ) + \frac { 3 } { 1 6 } \log ( 2 ) ^ 2 \right ) ( b - 1 ) ^ 3 + \left ( \frac { 1 } { 1 6 } \log ( 2 ) + \frac { 3 } { 1 6 } \log ( 2 ) ^ 2 + \frac { 1 } { 3 2 } \log ( 2 ) ^ 3 - \frac { 1 } { 1 9 2 } \log ( 2 ) ^ 4 \right ) ( b - 1 ) ^ 4 - \left ( \frac { 1 } { 3 2 } \log ( 2 ) + \frac { 5 } { 3 2 } \log ( 2 ) ^ 2 + \frac { 5 } { 6 4 } \log ( 2 ) ^ 3 - \frac { 5 } { 3 8 4 } \log ( 2 ) ^ 4 \right ) ( b - 1 ) ^ 5 + o \left ( ( b - 1 ) ^ 5 \right ) </m> however , that is not nearly enough for practical applications since the convergence is really slow . so here is my question . can we find a general formula for the <m> n ^ { t h } </m> term ? alternatively , is there any other faster converging series that could be derived in this case ? to be a bit more precise , i am absolutely convinced that the coefficients of the expansion are rational polynomials in <m> \log ( 2 ) </m> , i.e. <m> a _ n = P _ n ( \log ( 2 ) ) </m> . and i am looking for a recursive or explicit formulation of these polynomials . or alternatively any other series type -LRB- chebyshev ? -RRB- the convergence of which would be faster . thanks a lot for your help !
let <m> a + i b </m> be a complex number . it is well-known that <m> \left | \Gamma \left ( a + i b \right ) \right | \sim \sqrt { 2 \pi } e ^ { - \pi \left | b \right | / 2 } \left | b \right | ^ { a - 1 / 2 } </m> for any fixed <m> a </m> and <m> \left | b \right | \rightarrow \infty . </m> now let <m> z = c + i d , \, c > 0 . </m>
feedback vertex set is a set of vertices whose removal leaves an acyclic graph . it is known that every vertex transitive graph on <m> n </m> vertices has minimum vertex cover of size <m> \Omega ( n ) </m> . it is also not difficult to show that every connected vertex transitive graph -LRB- except for the cycle of length <m> n </m> -RRB- has minimum feedback vertex set of size <m> \Omega ( n / \log ^ 2 n ) </m> . does <m> \Omega ( n ) </m> bound hold for the same ?
is it possible to prove without continuum hypothesis that for every uncountable subset <m> S </m> of <m> \mathbb { R } </m> there is a real number <m> x </m> that splits it into two parts of the same cardinality , i.e. <m> \left | S \cap ( - \infty , x ) \right | = \left | S \cap ( x , \infty ) \right | </m> ? -LRB- if the answer to the first question is no -RRB- is this statement equivalent to continuum hypothesis ?
let <m> C </m> and <m> D </m> be presentable stable <m> \infty </m> - categories , and let <m> f : C \to D </m> be a continuous functor between them . let <m> 0 </m> be the trivial stable <m> \infty </m> - category . what is the colimit of the diagram <m> 0 \leftarrow C \rightarrow D </m> in the <m> \infty </m> - category of presentable stable <m> \infty </m> - categories and continuous functors ? for example , is it a localization of <m> D </m> ?
this question is closely related to the following mo question characterizing the real analytic eisenstein series let <m> \mathfrak { h } = \{ z = x + i y \in \mathbf { C } \} </m> be the poincare upper half plane endowed with its poincare metric . let <m> w \in \mathbf { Z } </m> be a weight and define the `` weight <m> w </m> laplacian '' on <m> \mathfrak { h } </m> by <m> \Delta [ w ] = - y ^ 2 ( \partial _ x ^ 2 + \partial _ y ^ 2 ) + i \cdot w \cdot y \cdot \partial _ x . </m> here <m> i = \sqrt { - 1 } </m> . in general , <m> \Delta [ w ] </m> will commute with the <m> | _ { w } </m> right action of <m> G L _ 2 ^ + ( \mathbf { R } ) </m> on maass forms as is explained on page 130 of bump 's book on automorphic forms and representations . consider the differential equation <m> ( 1 ) \; \; \; \; \; \; \; \; \Delta [ w ] f ( y , s ) = ( s - w / 2 ) ( 1 - s + w / 2 ) f ( y ) , </m> where <m> f ( y , s ) </m> is a function depending only on <m> y = I m ( z ) </m> and <m> s \in \mathbf { C } </m> and is such that <m> s \mapsto f ( y , s ) </m> is meromorphic . solving the corresponding linear ode of order <m> 2 </m> in <m> y </m> we see that the solution space of -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- for <m> s \neq \frac { 1 } { 2 } </m> -RRB- has the form <m> A ( s ) y ^ { s - w / 2 } + B ( s ) y ^ { 1 - s + w / 2 } . </m> where <m> A ( s ) </m> and <m> B ( s ) </m> are meromorphic functions in <m> s </m> . let <m> g \in \mathbf { Z } _ { \geq 1 } </m> be a fixed integer and consider the symmetric space <m> \mathfrak { h } ^ g </m> . let <m> \underline { z } = ( z _ j ) _ { j = 1 } ^ g \in \mathfrak { h } ^ g </m> where <m> z _ j = x _ j + i y _ j </m> . let <m> \underline { w } = ( w _ 1 , w _ 2 , \ldots , w _ g ) \in \mathbf { Z } ^ g </m> be an integral weight vector . we let <m> D _ j [ w _ j ] </m> be the weight <m> w _ j </m> laplacian with respect to the variable <m> z _ j </m> . consider now the following differential system of linear pdes : <m> ( 2 ) \; \; \; \; \; \; \; \; \; D _ j [ w _ j ] f ( \underline { y } , s ) = ( s - w _ j / 2 ) ( 1 - s + w _ j / 2 ) f ( \underline { y } , s ) \; \; \; \; \; \; \; \; \; ( 1 \leq j \leq g ) </m> where <m> f ( \underline { y } , s ) </m> is a function depending only on <m> I m ( \underline { z } ) = \underline { y } = ( y _ 1 , \ldots , y _ g ) </m> and <m> s </m> and which is such that <m> s \mapsto f ( \underline { y } , s ) </m> is meromorphic . let <m> J \cup J ' = \{ 1 , 2 , \ldots , g \} </m> with <m> J \cap J ' = \emptyset </m> be a partition of <m> \{ 1 , 2 , \ldots , g \} </m> in two blocks . a solution for <m> ( 2 ) </m> is given by <m> ( 3 ) \; \; \; \; \; \; \; \; A _ { I , I ' } ( s ) \prod _ { j \in J } y _ j ^ { s - w _ j / 2 } \prod _ { j \in J ' } y _ j ^ { 1 - s + w _ j / 2 } . </m> here <m> A _ { J , J ' } ( s ) </m> are meromorphic functions in <m> 2 </m> . let us take the <m> \mathbf { C } </m> - vector space generated by all such solutions and call it <m> V </m> . note that <m> V </m> is a vector space of dimension <m> 2 ^ g </m> over the ring of meromorphic functions in one variable . q : are all the solutions of the differential system <m> ( 2 ) </m> elements of <m> V </m> ? remarks : -LRB- a -RRB- since <m> f ( \underline { y } , s ) </m> depends only on <m> \underline { y } </m> and not on the variables <m> \underline { x } </m> , the action of <m> D _ { j } [ w _ j ] </m> on <m> f ( \underline { y } ) </m> simplifies . therefore the system -LRB- 2 -RRB- becomes a system of linear odes of order <m> 2 </m> in the variables <m> y _ i </m> 's . but i preferred to keep <m> D _ { j } [ w _ j ] </m> as i thought of it orginally , since i find it better motivated . -LRB- b -RRB- so my heuristic reasoning which makes me think that the question has an affirmative answer is the following : let us fix the index <m> j = 1 </m> and let <m> f ( \underline { y } , s ) </m> be a solution to <m> D _ 1 [ w _ 1 ] f ( \underline { y } , s ) = ( s - w _ j / 2 ) ( 1 - s + w _ j / 2 ) f ( \underline { y } , s ) . </m> then we know from ode theory that <m> f ( \underline { y } , s ) = A _ 1 ( s , y _ 2 , \ldots , y _ g ) y _ 1 ^ { s - w _ j / 2 } + B _ 1 ( s , y _ 2 , \ldots , y _ g ) y _ 1 ^ { 1 - s + w _ j / 2 } </m> for some functions <m> A _ 1 ( s , y _ 2 , \ldots , y _ g ) </m> and <m> B _ 1 ( s , y _ 2 , \ldots , y _ g ) </m> . and then we can keep repeating this procedure until we sieve out all the variables <m> y _ i </m> 's . but i feel a bit uneasy with this kind of reasoning because of a lack of personal experience with pde systems ...
the set <m> { \cal B } = \big \{ \emptyset \big \} \cup \big \{ \{ a + b n : n \in \omega \} : a \in \omega , b \in ( \omega \setminus \{ 0 \} ) \big \} </m> is a basis for a topology <m> \tau </m> on <m> \omega </m> . is there a surjective continuous map from <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> with the euclidean topology onto <m> ( \omega , \tau ) </m> , or the other way round , or in neither direction ? note . these two spaces are not homeomorphic , since <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> is homogeneous , and <m> ( \omega , \tau ) </m> is not .
a theorem by kirchberg and phillips states that two unital separable nuclear simple purely infinite <m> C ^ * </m> - algebras -LRB- so called kirchberg algebras -RRB- satisfying the universal coefficient theorem are isomorphic if and only if their topological <m> K </m> - theory groups are isomorphic . taking here direct sums of abelian groups at the <m> K </m> - theory side , what does it mean at the kirchberg algebras side ?

i 've been reading this really nice paper by alper http://math.columbia.edu/~jarod/good_moduli_spaces.pdf , and there 's a question that does n't seem to be answered -LRB- perhaps it 's not relevant -RRB- . any stack f has a corresponding ` sheaf of connected components ' -LRB- or sheaf of isomorphism classes -RRB- , by taking <m> \pi _ 0 ^ { p r } ( F ) ( S ) = \pi _ 0 ( F ( S ) ) </m> and then sheafifying . -LRB- where <m> \pi _ 0 </m> of a groupoid , or more generally a category , is the set of isomorphism classes -RRB- if <m> X </m> is an artin stack -LRB- although i 'm currently more interested in dm stacks -RRB- and <m> X </m> admits a good moduli space , then is <m> X \to \pi _ 0 ( X ) </m> a good moduli space ? also , when is the good moduli space a scheme -LRB- and not just an algebraic space -RRB- ? and finally , if <m> X </m> = <m> S p e c R </m> is affine and <m> G </m> acts on it -LRB- i 'm mainly interested in the <m> G </m> finite case -RRB- , is <m> \pi _ 0 ( [ X / G ] ) = S p e c R ^ G </m> ?
let <m> X : = x ^ 3 </m> , <m> Y : = x ^ 2 y </m> , <m> Z : = x y ^ 2 </m> and <m> W : = y ^ 3 </m> be the 4 independent generators of <m> S ^ 3 \mathbb { C } ^ 2 </m> , and observe that the kernel of the natural epimorphism -LRB- total symmetrisation -RRB- <m> p : S ^ 2 S ^ 3 \mathbb { C } ^ 2 \longrightarrow S ^ 6 \mathbb { C } ^ 2 </m> is the 3-dimensional subspace generated by <m> X Z - Y ^ 2 \, , \quad X W - Y Z \, , \quad Y W - Z ^ 2 \, . </m> these are precisely the generators of the ideal of the twisted cubic in <m> \mathbb { C } \mathbb { P } ^ 3 = \mathbb { P } ( S ^ 3 \mathbb { C } ^ 2 ) </m> .
take <m> \mathbb C ^ 2 </m> with coordinates <m> ( z , w ) </m> . suppose that <m> J </m> is a <m> C ^ { \infty } </m> almost complex structure on <m> \mathbb C ^ 2 </m> such that the line <m> w = 0 </m> is <m> J </m> - holomorphic and <m> J ( 0 , 0 ) </m> is given by <m> ( z , w ) \to ( i z , i w ) </m> . suppose that there is a smooth function <m> f ( z ) : \mathbb D \to \mathbb C </m> defined on a unit disk <m> \mathbb D </m> such that the graph <m> ( z , f ( z ) ) \subset \mathbb C ^ 2 </m> is a <m> J </m> - holomorphic subvariety of <m> ( \mathbb C ^ 2 , J ) </m> -LRB- we do n't assume that <m> z \to ( z , f ( z ) ) </m> is a <m> J </m> - holomorphic map -RRB- . question . is it true that there is <m> n </m> and a constant <m> c \in ( 0 , 1 ) </m> such that <m> c | z ^ n | < | f ( z ) | < \frac { 1 } { c } | z ^ n | </m> for sufficiently small <m> z </m> ? remark . the statement is trivial in the case when <m> J </m> coincides with the standard complex structure on <m> \mathbb C ^ 2 </m> . this question is a follow up to two smooth tangent almost complex curves in a <m> 4 </m> - manifold
this question is inspired by an old question of greg kuperberg , about how small is the first prime <m> p </m> which makes a given monic polynomial <m> P </m> with integral coefficient have a -LRB- simple -RRB- root modulo <m> p </m> . now `` small '' makes sense w.r.t. something , some notion of size of polynomials . in greg 's question the size is measured by the degree <m> n </m> of <m> P </m> and the <m> L ^ 1 </m> - norm -LRB- or <m> L ^ \infty </m> - norm of its coeffcients , but i will rather use as measure of size the degree <m> d </m> and the product <m> M </m> of the primes <m> p </m> dividing the discriminant of <m> P </m> -LRB- in short <m> M </m> is the radical of the discriminant of <m> P </m> -RRB- : this is essentially equivalent to greg 's notions but more in line with the literature on the subject . this being said the result of weinberger alluded to by greg is , under grh , the following :
could someone provide or point me to a family of number rings <m> \mathcal { O } _ { K _ n } </m> that require <m> n </m> generators -LRB- as <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - algebra -RRB- ? second best would be a family requiring <m> f ( n ) </m> generators for a strictly increasing and positive function <m> f : \mathbb { N } \to \mathbb { N } </m> . i would also be interested in seeing several explicit examples of number rings requiring 3 or 4 generators
i asked this question on mse , but did n't get enough information . if it is a violation of some norms , let me know , i 'll delete it . i 'm having problem solving this difference equation . initially i thought it should be quite easy to solve using generating functions -LRB- e.g. like in migdal -LRB- 2010 -RRB- , woodbury -LRB- 1949 -RRB- or gani -LRB- 2006 -RRB- , but have made no progress so far . the intuition behind it is that each iteration population either increases by 1 species -LRB- with probability <m> p ( x ) </m> or stays the same w.p. <m> q ( x ) </m> , so <m> A ( n , x ) </m> can be seen as the expected size of the population at iteration <m> n </m> . it seems pretty straightforward , but i could n't move along . i know the solution involves casoratian and finding some product <m> \Pi _ { x = 1 } ^ { m } p ( x ) </m> , but apart form that i couldn 'd do much . also , if it happens to be some well-known problem , please do n't solve it for me , just point in the right direction mse link
question : can every probability space <m> ( X , \scr F , \mu ) </m> be <m> \sigma </m> - embedded in the completion of the space <m> [ 0 , 1 ] ^ K </m> -LRB- equipped with a product of lebesgue measure -RRB- for some set <m> K </m> ? here , <m> f : \scr F \to \scr G </m> is a <m> \sigma </m> - embedding of the measure space <m> ( X , \scr F , \mu ) </m> into <m> ( Y , \scr G , \nu ) </m> iff <m> f </m> is one-to-one , and preserves measure , complements and countable unions . here 's what i have so far : maharam 's theorem implies the measure -LRB- or probability -RRB- algebra of <m> X </m> is <m> \sigma </m> - isomorphic to the measure -LRB- or probability -RRB- algebra of a disjoint union of countably many copies of <m> [ 0 , 1 ] ^ { K _ n } </m> -LRB- if <m> X </m> has atoms , some of the <m> K _ n </m> will be empty -RRB- , and of course the disjoint union <m> \sigma </m> - embeds in the measure algebra of <m> [ 0 , 1 ] ^ K </m> for large enough <m> K </m> . combining this with a lifting , we get a map from <m> \scr F </m> to <m> { \scr L } ^ K </m> , the measurable sets of the completion of <m> [ 0 , 1 ] ^ K </m> , that preserves measure , complements and finite unions and is almost one-to-one -LRB- i.e. , <m> f ( A ) = f ( B ) </m> implies <m> \mu ( A \Delta B ) = 0 </m> -RRB- . we can make the embedding be one-to-one by ensuring <m> K </m> is large enough that there is a null subset <m> N </m> of <m> [ 0 , 1 ] ^ K </m> of the same cardinality as <m> X </m> and replacing our almost one-to-one map <m> f : { \scr F } \to { \scr L } ^ K </m> with <m> g ( A ) = ( f ( A ) \backslash N ) \cup h [ A ] </m> , where <m> h </m> is a bijection between <m> X </m> and <m> N </m> . then <m> g </m> will be an embedding into the completion of <m> [ 0 , 1 ] ^ K </m> . but i want a <m> \sigma </m> - embedding .
i was thinking about <m> l o g ( \omega ) </m> which appears to be <m> \{ \mathbb { N } | \omega ^ { \frac { 1 } { n } } \} _ { n \in \mathbb { N } } \stackrel { ? } { = } \omega ^ \frac { 1 } { \omega } </m> . intuitively , there 's the idea that , if the highest power of <m> \omega </m> is greater for one surreal number , then it is greater , but this seems incorrect for two reasons : <m> n < \omega ^ \frac { 1 } { \omega } \rightarrow n ^ \omega < \omega </m> the statement on the right is not true , hence the question . additionally , from a real analysis perspective , <m> \lim _ { n \to \infty } { n ^ { \frac { 1 } { n } } } = 1 </m>
is this known ? what is the expected width of the <m> k </m> - th layer -LRB- anti-chain layer -RRB- of a <m> d </m> - dimensional partially ordered set of <m> n </m> elements formed by product of <m> d </m> random linear orders chosen from the same distribution . it is well known for <m> k = 1 </m> -LRB- http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf00582738 -RRB- . but not able to find any reference for <m> k > 1 </m> .
let <m> M </m> be a nice , connected topological space . assume it is a manifold , if you like . there are two rather similar looking differential-graded -LRB- dg -RRB- categories that one can associate to <m> M </m> that capture something about the homotopy type of <m> M </m> . the first is the full dg category of complexes of sheaves of vector spaces -LRB- over some field -RRB- having locally constant cohomology sheaves . the other is the dg category of dg modules with finite dimensional cohomology over the dg algebra of chains <m> C _ { * } ( \Omega M ) </m> on the based loop space <m> \Omega M </m> . ways in which these two categories are similar . first , they both have an obvious t-structure for which the heart consists of locally constant sheaves of vector spaces . for the category built from sheaves , this obvious . for the algebraically defined category , just note that <m> H _ { 0 } ( \Omega M ) </m> is the group algebra of <m> \pi _ { 1 } M </m> . second , i 've seen some computations showing that the mapping complexes between objects in the hearts are quasi-isomorphic . given these two pieces of evidence , i would guess that the two dg categories should be -LRB- quasi -RRB- equivalent . so my first question is whether this is in fact the case , and if so , how to write down a pair of -LRB- quasi -RRB- inverse functors between these categories . is this written down anywhere ?
suppose <m> T : c _ { 0 0 } \to c _ { 0 0 } </m> is a linear map such that , when regarded as an infinite matrix , there is a uniform bound on the <m> \ell _ 1 </m> - norms of its columns , and a uniform bound on the <m> \ell _ 1 </m> - norms of its rows . that is , <m> \newcommand { \Bdd } { { \mathcal B } } \newcommand { \Cst } { { \rm C } ^ * } </m> <m> \sup _ j \sum _ i | T _ { i j } | < \infty </m> and <m> \sup _ i \sum _ j | T _ { i j } | < \infty \; . </m> one can show that if <m> C </m> is the maximum of these two sups , then <m> \Vert T ( \xi ) \Vert _ p \leq C \Vert \xi \Vert _ p </m> for all <m> \xi \in c _ { 0 0 } </m> and all <m> p \in [ 1 , \infty ] </m> . now let <m> B _ { 0 0 } </m> be the set of all such <m> T </m> ; this is a subalgebra of <m> { \rm L i n } ( c _ { 0 0 } ) </m> and by abuse of notation we can regard it as a subalgebra of every <m> \Bdd ( \ell _ p ) </m> . in particular it 's a <m> * </m> - subalgebra of <m> \Bdd ( \ell _ 2 ) </m> , so its norm closure <m> B _ 2 </m> is a <m> \Cst </m> - subalgebra of <m> \Bdd ( \ell _ 2 ) </m> . the algebra <m> B _ 2 </m> is currently somewhat mysterious to me , and i am hoping that people reading mo may recognize it , or know of it under some different name . note that <m> B _ 2 </m> is not all of <m> \Bdd ( \ell _ 2 ) </m> , because there are operators in <m> \Bdd ( \ell _ 2 ) </m> that can not be approximated in norm by <m> \ell _ 1 </m> - preserving operators -LRB- cf. this old mo question -RRB- . if <m> G </m> is any countable discrete group then , regarding <m> B _ 2 </m> as a subalgebra of <m> \Bdd ( \ell _ 2 ( G ) ) </m> , a quick check shows that it contains <m> \lambda ( \ell _ 1 ( G ) ) </m> and hence contains <m> \Cst _ r ( G ) </m> . since <m> \Cst _ r ( G ) </m> need not be exact , <m> B _ 2 </m> ca n't be exact -LRB- and hence , as was pointed out in the comments , it ca n't have the cb approximation property -RRB- . q1 . does <m> B _ 2 </m> contain a copy -LRB- up to c.b. isomorphism , say -RRB- of the <m> \Cst </m> - algebraic direct product <m> \prod _ k M _ k ( { \bf C } ) </m> ? -LRB- this would imply that <m> B _ 2 </m> is not an exact <m> \Cst </m> - algebra , although we knew this already . -RRB- q2 . is there some identification of <m> B _ 2 </m> with a `` known type '' of <m> \Cst </m> - algebra ? e.g. some kind of crossed product of the form <m> \ell ^ \infty ( X ) \rtimes G </m> for some group <m> G </m> acting on a countable set <m> X </m> ? q3 . does <m> B _ 2 </m> have the -LRB- metric -RRB- approximation property ?
want to find <m> f _ n </m> a sequence of continuous functions , so that for all borel regular measure <m> \mu </m> , we have <m> \int f _ n d \mu \rightarrow \int \chi _ \Delta d \mu </m> , as <m> n </m> goes to infinity , where <m> \Delta </m> is a borel set .
define n-quantum vector space to be the algebra <m> { \mathbb C } _ q ^ n : = \mathbb { C } \left < x _ i \mid i = 1 , \ldots , N \right > / \left < x _ i x _ j = q x _ j x _ i \mid i < j \right > . </m> for <m> q = 1 </m> , we get the usual polynomial ring in <m> n </m> - variables , and so , serre 's conjecture -LRB- quillen -- suslin theorem -RRB- tells that every finitely generated projective module over <m> { \mathbb C } _ 1 ^ n </m> is free . how does this work for <m> q \neq 1 </m> ? is there a <m> q </m> - deformed quillen -- suslin theorem ? the not a root of unity case is the most interesting to me .
this is a re-post from mse -LRB- because i did not get the kind of answer i wanted even after offering a bounty -RRB- . at the outset i must mention that i do n't have a fairly working knowledge of galois theory -LRB- but do have some idea of group theory in the sense that i can understand normal subgroups -RRB- . i read the proof of unsolvability of a general quintic via radicals from j p tignol 's `` galois theory of algebraic equations '' . here he discusses the proof by abel and goes on to establish the following theorem -LRB- see details in my blog post -RRB- : theorem : let <m> x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } , \ldots x _ { n } </m> be indeterminates and let elements <m> a , b </m> be in field <m> K = \mathbb { C } ( x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } , \ldots , x _ { n } ) </m> such that <m> a = b ^ { p } </m> for some prime number <m> p </m> . let <m> n \geq 5 </m> and define permutations <m> \sigma , \tau </m> such that <m> \sigma </m> permutes <m> x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } , x _ { 3 } </m> cyclically and <m> \tau </m> permutes <m> x _ { 3 } , x _ { 4 } , x _ { 5 } </m> cyclically . if <m> a </m> in invariant under both <m> \sigma , \tau </m> then so is <m> b </m> . because of the equation <m> a = b ^ { p } </m> the above theorem implies that when <m> n \geq 5 </m> there are some symmetries -LRB- invariance under <m> \sigma , \tau </m> -RRB- which remain even after taking radicals . thus starting with the elementary symmetric function <m> s _ { 1 } , s _ { 2 } , \ldots , s _ { n } </m> of the indeterminates <m> x _ { i } </m> the process of taking radicals will preserve the symmetries related to <m> \sigma , \tau </m> . on the other hand each one of the indeterminates <m> x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } , x _ { 3 } , x _ { 4 } , x _ { 5 } </m> is changed via at least one of <m> \sigma </m> and <m> \tau </m> . thus the field <m> K </m> has elements which are changed by <m> \sigma , \tau </m> but any element of a radical extension of <m> F = \mathbb { C } ( s _ { 1 } , s _ { 2 } , \ldots , s _ { n } ) </m> is invariant under <m> \sigma , \tau </m> and hence it is not possible to get to <m> K </m> from <m> F </m> via radical extensions . on the other hand most modern treatments of unsolvability of quintic base it on the simplicity of alternating group <m> A _ { 5 } </m> . understanding the above mentioned theorem in tignol 's book is quite easy -LRB- simple algebraic manipulation -RRB- but its not same as regards to simplicity of <m> A _ { 5 } </m> .
hi , i am currently working through the paper by bousfield and gugenheim on rational homotopy theory , and have come to a point where they show why it is important to work over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> , and not just any field -LRB- remark 9.7 -RRB- . they assert that if <m> H o m _ k ( H o m _ { \mathbb { Z } } ( G , k ) , k ) = G </m> for some non-trivial abelian group <m> G </m> , and some field <m> k </m> -LSB- edit : of characteristic <m> 0 </m> -RSB- -LRB- thanks to fernando muro for pointing out that we need characteristic <m> 0 </m> -RRB- , then we must have <m> k = \mathbb { Q } </m> -LRB- and also that <m> G </m> is finite dimensional as a <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> - vector space , which is clear enough -RRB- . i ca n't quite see what property of <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> this reduces to , and it really makes my head spin trying to think through it . the paper is now available online , just google `` on pl de rham theory and rational homotopy type '' . any suggestions would be great . thanks brian
in a review seminar today , i heard the speaker takes the below for granted , but i have no enough background `` yang-mills -LRB- ym -RRB- instantons in 4d can be naturally identified with -LRB- i.e. have the same parameter space as -RRB- the instantons in 2d for the theory in which the complex projective <m> n </m> - space <m> C P ^ n </m> is replaced by the infinite - dimensional manifold <m> G </m> of loops on the structure group <m> G </m> . such a theory is not as bizarre as it appears because <m> G </m> is well-known to share most of the important properties of <m> C P ^ n </m> and it arises naturally in many contexts . so my questions are that
i recently read the statement `` up to conjugacy there are 4 nontrivial finite subgroups of <m> { \rm S L } _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> . '' they are generated by <m> \left ( \begin {array} { c c } - 1 & 0 \\ \ 0 & - 1 \end {array} \right ) , \left ( \begin {array} { c c } - 1 & - 1 \\ \ 1 & 0 \end {array} \right ) , \left ( \begin {array} { c c } 0 & - 1 \\ \ 1 & 0 \end {array} \right ) , \left ( \begin {array} { c c } 0 & - 1 \\ \ 1 & 1 \end {array} \right ) </m> and are isomorphic to <m> \mathbb { Z } _ 2 </m> , <m> \mathbb { Z } _ 3 </m> , <m> \mathbb { Z } _ 4 </m> , and <m> \mathbb { Z } _ 6 </m> , respectively . does someone know a reference for this statement ? -LRB- or , is it easy to see ? -RRB- my attempt at a google search turned up this statement , but i was n't able to find a reference .
stallings proves the following -LRB- remarkable theorem ! -RRB- using the lower central series . -LRB- homology and central series of groups , p171 . -RRB- suppose <m> G </m> is a group , <m> K </m> a field , with <m> H _ 2 ( G , K ) = 0 </m> . if <m> x _ 1 , \dotsc , x _ n \in G </m> are linearly independent when considered as elements of <m> H _ 1 ( G , K ) </m> , then <m> x _ 1 , \dotsc , x _ n </m> form the basis of a free subgroup of <m> G </m> . this has the following corollary . if <m> G = \pi _ 1 ( X ) </m> , <m> X </m> a compact aspherical <m> 2 </m> -- complex , <m> G </m> not free , and generated by <m> n </m> elements , then <m> \chi ( G ) > 1 - n </m> . is there a proof of the corollary that does n't go via the lower central series ?

let <m> \mathcal { M } </m> be a compact riemannian manifold and let <m> I = ( 0 , 1 ) </m> . i seek a trace theorem saying that functions <m> u \in H ^ 1 ( \mathcal { M } \times I ) </m> have a well-defined trace at <m> \mathcal { M } \times \{ 0 \} </m> and <m> \mathcal { M } \times \{ 1 \} </m> in some fractional sobolev space . furthermore , since the boundary of <m> \mathcal { M } \times I </m> is disjoint , how does one think of the trace mapping ? can someone point out a reference ? thank you .
consider a polynomial <m> f ( z ) = c \prod _ m ( z - \lambda _ m ) \in \mathbb { C } [ z ] </m> . i am mostly interested in the case where this actually lies in <m> \mathbb { R } [ z ] </m> , but that is not essential . i wanted to find a nice formula for a smooth function on <m> \mathbb { R } </m> , depending continuously on the coefficients of <m> f ( z ) </m> , which approximates a sum of <m> \delta </m> functions concentrated at the real roots of <m> f </m> . a natural choice is <m> \phi _ \epsilon ( f ) ( t ) = \sum _ m \exp ( - \pi | t - \lambda _ m | ^ 2 / \epsilon ^ 2 ) . </m> i found that <m> \sum _ m \exp ( - \pi | \lambda _ m | ^ 2 ) = \iint _ { \mathbb { C } } k ( | z | ) \log | f ( z ) | \, | d z | ^ 2 , </m> where <m> k ( r ) = 4 ( \pi r ^ 2 - 1 ) e ^ { - \pi r ^ 2 } = - 2 r ^ { - 1 } \frac { d } { d r } ( r ^ 2 e ^ { - \pi r ^ 2 } ) . </m> the more general formula <m> \phi _ \epsilon ( f ) ( t ) = \epsilon ^ { - 2 } \iint _ { \mathbb { C } } k ( | z - t | / \epsilon ) \log | f ( z ) | \, | d z | ^ 2 </m> can easily be deduced from this . i have a proof of all this , by a longish chain of fairly standard manipulations , but it is probably more complicated than necessary . i suspect that this identity must be known , but i do n't believe i have ever seen it before . can anyone point me to a reference ?
given a positive integer <m> N </m> , what is the size of the smallest set of integers <m> A </m> such that , for any integer <m> 1 \leq k \leq N </m> , we can find two integers <m> x , y \in A </m> such that <m> x - y = k </m> ? -LRB- an alternative way to write this condition is to ask that <m> \{ 1 , \ldots , N \} \subseteq A - A </m> . -RRB- for example , for <m> N = 9 </m> , we could take <m> A = \{ - 3 , - 2 , - 1 , 0 , 3 , 6 \} </m> , which achieves <m> | A | = 6 </m> . it easy to see that <m> | A | \geq \sqrt { 2 N } </m> , as at most <m> \binom { | A | } 2 \leq | A | ^ 2 / 2 </m> differences can be formed from the elements of <m> A </m> . i can also construct suitable sets <m> A </m> with <m> | A | = 2 \sqrt N </m> .
assume <m> a \in \mathbb { R } </m> and <m> s \in \mathbb { C } </m> . numerical evidence suggests that all complex zeros , except for a finite few outside the strip , of : <m> \zeta ( a + s ) \pm \zeta ( a + 1 - s ) </m> lie on the line <m> \Re ( s ) = \frac 1 2 </m> for <m> a \le 0 </m> . when <m> a = 0 </m> the problem reduces to this question -LRB- including the rh -RRB- . this question shows that it can be proven unconditionally that all complex zeros , except a finite few , of : <m> \zeta ( a + s ) \pm \zeta ( a - s ) </m> lie on the line <m> \Re ( s ) = 0 </m> for <m> a \le 0 </m> . these two appear to be quite similar despite their difference only being <m> 1 </m> . i also did experiment with <m> \zeta ( a + s ) \pm \zeta ( a + x - s ) </m> and the conjecture seems to hold for all <m> x \le 1 </m> with zeros lying on the line <m> \frac { x } { 2 } </m> . questions : 1 -RRB- is there any -LRB- known -RRB- counter example for the conjecture about the critical line ? 2 -RRB- i guess that the unconditional proof for the line <m> \Re ( s ) = 0 </m> can not be easily applied to the conjecture about the critical line <m> \Re ( s ) = \frac 1 2 </m> , however i would be keen to understand why it would fail . thanks . addition : below are two graphs of the zeros at <m> s = \frac 1 2 + y \, i </m> for respectively <m> \zeta ( a + s ) + \zeta ( a + 1 - s ) </m> and <m> \zeta ( a + s ) - \zeta ( a + 1 - s ) </m> . the <m> a </m> varies in steps of <m> 0 . 0 1 </m> from <m> - 2 </m> till <m> + 0 . 2 </m> . the imaginary parts of any zeros lying off the critical line for <m> a > 0 </m> are suppressed . note that the distribution of the imaginary parts tends to becomes more and more regular when we move further towards the left .
let <m> A </m> be an abelian group and <m> p </m> be a prime . if <m> p \ne 2 , </m> there is a very nice functorial description of the homology algebra <m> H _ * ( A , \mathbb Z / p ) : </m> <m> H _ * ( A , \mathbb Z / p ) \cong \Lambda ^ * ( A / p ) \otimes \Gamma ^ { * / 2 } ( { } _ p A ) , </m> where <m> \Lambda ^ * </m> denotes the exterior algebra , <m> \Gamma ^ * </m> denotes the divided power algebra and <m> { } _ p A </m> denotes <m> p </m> - torsion of <m> A </m> -LRB- see theorem 6.6 in chapter v of brown 's `` cohomology of groups '' -RRB- . i like this isomorphism -LRB- like = it is useful for me -RRB- because 1 -RRB- it is functorial . 2 -RRB- the right part depends only on <m> A / p </m> and <m> { } _ p A </m> . there is also such an isomorphism for <m> p = 2 </m> but it is not functorial . and i do not like it because of this . for any prime <m> p </m> -LRB- including <m> p = 2 </m> -RRB- there is a short exact sequence of functors <m> 0 \longrightarrow \Lambda ^ 2 ( A / p ) \longrightarrow H _ 2 ( A , \mathbb Z / p ) \longrightarrow { } _ p A \longrightarrow 0 . </m> i like this short exact sequence because it gives a functorial ` description ' of <m> H _ 2 ( A , \mathbb Z / 2 ) </m> in terms of <m> A / 2 </m> and <m> { } _ 2 A . </m> the word ` description ' here in a weak sense because it is not an isomorphism . but it is ok for me . question : is there a functorial ` description ' of <m> H _ n ( A , \mathbb Z / 2 ) </m> in terms of <m> A / 2 </m> and <m> { } _ 2 A </m> ? here the word ` description ' can be in some weak sense .

i would like to apply the usual ` functoriality properties ' of the perverse <m> t </m> - structure to torsion -LRB- constructible complexes of -RRB- sheaves -LRB- i am in the algebraic setting , so these are etale sheaves , but probably the difference from the ` topological case ' is not very large here -RRB- i.e. i want to use the corresponding left and right <m> t </m> - exactnesses of <m> f _ \ast </m> , <m> f ^ \ast </m> , <m> f _ ! </m> and <m> f ^ ! </m> when <m> f </m> is smooth or affine ; constant sheaf over a local complete intersection variety -LRB- shifted by the dimension -RRB- is perverse ; etc. it seems that there are two possibilities .

the hurwitz zeta function : <m> \zeta _ { H } ( s , a ) </m> reduces to <m> \zeta ( s ) </m> when <m> a = 1 </m> and to <m> ( 2 ^ s - 1 ) \zeta ( s ) </m> when <m> a = \frac 1 2 </m> . however , i stumbled upon a peculiar third connection : <m> \zeta _ { H } ( s , a ) + \zeta _ { H } ( s , 1 - a ) </m> that seems to exactly produce the non-trivial zeros of <m> \zeta ( s ) </m> , when <m> a = \frac 1 2 </m> -LRB- obviously -RRB- , but also -LRB- and apparently only -RRB- when <m> a = \frac 1 3 , \frac 1 4 </m> or <m> \frac 1 6 . </m> why does it only work for these values ? is there any reference to this in the literature ? thanks .
one basic aspect of the 3d tqft/2d cft correspondence that i 'd like to understand better is the following . it is often said that the ground states of chern-simons theory on a -LRB- spatial -RRB- torus are in one-to-one correspondence with the distinct wilson lines of the theory . this can be seen in canonical quantization , as per witten 's original paper . it is natural to ask what `` distinct '' means , namely : what are the precise equivalence classes of wilson lines that map to these ground states ? the answer to this question in the case of abelian chern-simons seems to be well-known -LRB- see , e.g. , appendix c of this recent paper -RRB- . i am interested in the case of simple gauge group <m> G </m> ; for simplicity , let me phrase the question in the context of <m> S U ( 2 ) </m> . <m> S U ( 2 ) _ k </m> chern-simons on a torus has <m> k + 1 </m> ground states labeled by half-integers <m> j = 0 , \ldots , k / 2 </m> . these can equivalently be viewed as the <m> k + 1 </m> primary operators in the <m> S U ( 2 ) _ k </m> wzw model , where the truncation of <m> S U ( 2 ) </m> representations to the set of integrable representations of the <m> S U ( 2 ) _ k </m> affine kac-moody algebra is well-understood . from the 3d point of view , however , a wilson line can carry any <m> S U ( 2 ) </m> representation -LRB- half-integer <m> j </m> -RRB- : to respect the 2d truncation , all such lines should fall into equivalence classes labeled by the basic lines <m> j = 0 , \ldots , k / 2 </m> . to help identify these equivalence classes , it is natural to examine the correlation functions of these lines -LRB- rather , loops -RRB- . recall that the modular <m> S </m> - matrix of <m> S U ( 2 ) _ k </m> is given by <m> S _ { j j ' } = \sqrt { \frac { 2 } { k + 2 } } \sin \left [ \frac { \pi ( 2 j + 1 ) ( 2 j ' + 1 ) } { k + 2 } \right ] , </m> in a basis of integrable representations . two basic observables of <m> S U ( 2 ) _ k </m> chern-simons on <m> S ^ 3 </m> are the expectation value of an unknotted spin - <m> j </m> wilson loop and the expectation value of two wilson loops of spins <m> j , j ' </m> in a hopf link , which i denote by <m> \langle W _ j \rangle = \frac { S _ { 0 j } } { S _ { 0 0 } } , \quad \langle W _ j W _ { j ' } \rangle = \frac { S _ { j j ' } } { S _ { 0 0 } } , </m> respectively . one sees that the first -LRB- positive -RRB- value of <m> j </m> for which <m> \langle W _ j \rangle = 0 </m> is that immediately above the truncation threshold : <m> j = ( k + 1 ) / 2 </m> . more generally , from these expressions , it is clear that a line of spin <m> j </m> and a line of spin <m> j + k + 2 </m> have identical correlation functions , while lines with <m> j = n ( k / 2 + 1 ) - 1 / 2 </m> for any integer <m> n </m> do not exist -LRB- vanish identically -RRB- . here , one should distinguish the trivial line <m> j = 0 </m> , which has <m> \langle W _ 0 \rangle = 1 </m> and trivial braiding with all other lines , from nonexistent lines , which have <m> \langle W _ j \rangle = 0 </m> and vanishing correlation functions with all other lines . on the other hand , a line with <m> j </m> and a line with <m> j + k / 2 + 1 </m> have the same expectation value and braiding , up to a sign . in other words , at the level of correlation functions , <m> S U ( 2 ) _ k </m> wilson lines are antiperiodic with period <m> k / 2 + 1 </m> . the question , then , is as follows : although a spin - <m> j </m> line and a spin - <m> ( j + k / 2 + 1 ) </m> line can be distinguished in 3d by their correlation functions , do they map to the same states in 2d cft -LRB- as one would naively expect -RRB- , and if so , how can one see this ? if one is ambitious , one could try to explain the analogue of this antiperiodicity phenomenon for arbitrary simple , compact <m> G </m> . here , once more , the 2d side seems well-understood -LRB- in contrast to the 3d side -RRB- : for instance , in an arbitrary wzw model , the fusion rule eigenvalues -LRB- computed from the <m> S </m> - matrix elements -RRB- are equal to the finite weyl characters of <m> G </m> , evaluated on some special cartan angles that respect the truncation of the relevant representations -LRB- verlinde -RRB- .
why we use the symbol <m> \sqrt { } </m> when we take square roots ? anybody knows the history ?

definition : let <m> h </m> be a polynomial in <m> n </m> variables , then : <m> \gamma ( h , r , R ) : = \{ v \in \mathbb { Z } ^ { n } : \vert h ( v ) \vert \leq r , \Vert v \Vert < R \} </m> let <m> \omega : \mathbb { Z } ^ { n } \to \{ 0 , 1 \} </m> be a function . definition : <m> \omega </m> is algebraically normal if for all <m> h </m> polynomial and <m> \forall r \geq 0 </m> s. t. <m> \vert \gamma ( h , r , \infty ) \vert = \infty </m> : <m> \lim \limits _ { R \to \infty } \frac { \vert \omega ^ { - 1 } ( 0 ) \cap \gamma ( h , r , R ) \vert } { \vert \gamma ( h , r , R ) \vert } = \frac { 1 } { 2 } </m>
let <m> f : \mathbb { R } _ + \to \mathbb { R } _ + </m> be an orlicz function , or sometimes referred to as an young function , i.e. it is a convex , non-decreasing function such that <m> f ( 0 ) = 0 </m> . i am trying to study the convexity of the function <m> \phi : \mathbb { R } ^ n \to \mathbb { R } </m> , such that <m> \phi ( \mathbf { x } ) = f ^ { - 1 } \left ( \frac { 1 } { s } \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ s f ( | { x } _ j | ) \right ) </m> . note that when <m> f ( x ) = | x | ^ p , \ p \ge 1 </m> , then <m> \phi ( \mathbf { x } ) = \frac { \| \mathbf { x } \| _ p } { s ^ { 1 / p } } </m> , which is a convex function . similarly , a bit of calculation shows that the function <m> \phi </m> is also convex when <m> f ( x ) = e ^ { a x } - 1 </m> for any <m> a > 0 </m> . so intuitively i thought that this result might hold for all orlicz functions <m> f </m> . however , i have not been able to prove this result , and in fact , i think this does not hold for many functions , for example , <m> f ( x ) = e ^ { x ^ 2 } - 1 </m> . then , i am left with the investigation of such orlicz functions <m> f </m> , that make the corresponding <m> \phi </m> convex . however , assuming that <m> f </m> is double differentiable , the hessian of <m> \phi </m> is turning out to be too difficult to analyze . at this point , i am not sure how to proceed to find the properties of <m> f </m> that make <m> \phi </m> convex . can anyone kindly suggest some ideas , or point me to some relevant references that can help me proceed in this investigation ? thanks in advance .
for a topological group <m> X </m> by <m> A u t ( X ) </m> denote the group of topological isomorphisms <m> h : X \to X </m> . if <m> X </m> is compact then the compact-open topology turns <m> A u t ( X ) </m> into an <m> \omega </m> - narrow topological group . we recall that a topological group <m> X </m> is <m> \omega </m> - narrow if for any non-empty open set <m> U \subset X </m> of there exists a countable set <m> A \subset X </m> such that <m> X = A U </m> . problem . does the automorphism group <m> A u t ( X ) </m> of an <m> \omega </m> - narrow topological group <m> X </m> admit a topology <m> \tau </m> turning <m> A u t ( X ) </m> into an <m> \omega </m> - narrow topological group such that each compact subset <m> K \subset ( A u t ( X ) , \tau ) </m> is equicontinuous in the sense that for every neighborhood <m> U \subset X </m> of the unit there exists a neighborhood <m> V \subset X </m> of the unit such that <m> f ( V ) \subset U </m> for all <m> f \in K </m> ? remark . it seems that for any topological group <m> X </m> the automorphism group <m> A u t ( X ) </m> admits an <m> \omega </m> - narrow group topology : just identify <m> A u t ( X ) </m> with a subgroup of the homeomorphism group <m> H o m e o ( \beta X ) </m> of the stone-cech compactification of <m> X </m> . unfortunatley this topologization does not satisfy the equicontinuity condition .

if a group <m> G </m> acts on a set <m> X </m> , then we can speak of permutation representation on <m> K [ X ] </m> . now set of all <m> k </m> - subsets <m> X _ k </m> of <m> n = { 1 , 2 , . . . , n } </m> is a <m> S _ n </m> - set and we can speak about permutation representation on <m> K [ X _ k ] </m> . by decomposing it we get <m> [ k / 2 ] </m> irreducible representations <m> V _ 0 , . . . , V _ { [ k / 2 ] } </m> for k less than or equal to <m> n / 2 </m> . similarly we can do this for any partition of n instead of -LRB- k,n-k -RRB- which we consider in the above case and we obtain all irreducible representation of <m> S _ n </m> with the assumption that <m> K [ X ] </m> is completely reducible . i am looking for any other method -LRB- instead of permutation representation -RRB- which give as all irreducible representations of <m> S _ n </m> and its character values in simpler way . is there any method like this ? thank you .
i 'm interested in calculating all of the zeroes of the first derivative of the riemann <m> \zeta </m> function up to an arbitrary height . i know that -LRB- on the rh -RRB- , all of these zeroes will have real part <m> \ge \frac { 1 } { 2 } </m> . i am curious if there are equally strong upper bounds . according to titchmarsh , there is a constant c -LRB- <m> 2 < c < 3 </m> -RRB- such that every zero of <m> \zeta </m> ' -LRB- s -RRB- has real part less than c. a. l. skorokhodov , pade approximants and numerical analysis of the riemann zeta function , zh . vychisl . mat . mat . fiz. , 43 , no. 9 , 1330 -- 1352 , 2003 shows that <m> c \leq 2 . 9 3 9 3 8 </m> . has there been any improvement on this ?

is there a standard reference for the fact that , in an appropriate algebraic-geometrical context , the tangent space at the point <m> [ X ] </m> to a moduli space <m> \mathcal { M } </m> to determine , is something like <m> \bigoplus _ { k = 0 } ^ { n } \mathrm { C H } ^ { k } ( X , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> or something like <m> \bigoplus _ { k = 0 } ^ { n } H ^ { 2 k } ( X , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> ? <m> X </m> is a nonsingular complex projective variety of dimension <m> 2 n </m> . <m> \mathrm { C H } ^ k ( X , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> is the rational chow group of <m> X </m> with coefficients in <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> . <m> H ^ { 2 k } ( X , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> is the rational group cohomology of <m> X </m> with coefficients in <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> . unfortunately , i do not know enough things about deformation theory , so a study book on it that also proves something like <m> T _ { [ X ] } \mathcal { M } = \bigoplus _ { k = 0 } ^ { n } \mathrm { C H } ^ k ( X , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> or <m> T _ { [ X ] } \mathcal { M } = \bigoplus _ { k = 0 } ^ { n } H ^ { 2 k } ( X , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> would be welcome . thanks in advance .

it 's well-known that ad <m> _ \mathbb { R } </m> fails in <m> L ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> , provably in zfc . this is because :
given a probability model <m> \mathcal { P } = \{ P _ { \theta } , \theta \in \Theta \} </m> dominated by a <m> \sigma </m> - finite measure <m> \lambda </m> -LRB- e.g. lebesgue measure -RRB- on a locally compact space <m> \cal { X } </m> along with <m> \sigma </m> - field <m> \cal { F } </m> . a sufficient statistic is defined to be an <m> \cal { F } </m> - measurable mapping <m> T : \cal { X } \rightarrow \mathbb { R } </m> such that <m> P _ { \theta } ( X \mid T = t ) </m> does not depend on the <m> \theta \in \Theta </m> . according to neyman-fisher factorization theorem , the sufficient and necessary condition that <m> T </m> is a sufficient statistic for <m> \cal { P } </m> is that <m> p ( X \mid \theta ) = g ( T , \theta ) h ( X ) , \forall \theta \in \Theta , X \in \cal X </m> where <m> p ( X \mid \theta ) = \frac { d P _ { \theta } } { d \lambda } </m> is the density/radon-nikodym derivative w.r.t. <m> \lambda </m> . my questions : -LRB- 1 -RRB- since the conditional probability measure <m> P _ { \theta } ( X \mid T ) </m> is defined as a solution to the functional equation <m> \int _ { B } P _ { \theta } ( A \mid \sigma ( T ) ) d P _ { \theta } = P _ { \theta } ( A \cap B ) , \forall B \in \sigma ( T ) </m> , are there any characterization of the notion of sufficiency in terms of the <m> \sigma </m> - field <m> \sigma ( T ) </m> generated by the <m> \cal { F } </m> - measurable mapping <m> T </m> , and the <m> \sigma </m> - fields associated with <m> \cal { P } </m> ? -LRB- 2 -RRB- what is the implication of neyman-fisher theorem in terms of the product measure <m> \lambda _ \Theta \times \lambda </m> , assuming there is some measure <m> \lambda _ \Theta </m> given on the parameter space <m> \Theta </m> ? it doe not seem like `` independence '' though . i did not post this on stats.se because i think it will receive better response here .
recently i faced a problem , which i realized has a close connection with the following problem . <m> \{ f _ { n } \} _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } </m> is analytic map from <m> C ^ { n } </m> to <m> C ^ { n } </m> \ <m> U </m> where <m> U </m> is open neighborhood of 0 and <m> f </m> is a normal family . i know when n = 1 , this is really the montel normal family criterion . however , i did not know whether it is true for higher dimensions . also , i heard that for any two topological equivalent simple connected domains in <m> C ^ { n } </m> <m> ( n \geq 2 ) </m> , the probability for these two domains to be holomorphically equivalent is 0 . i want to know what is the precise statement for this theorem . any advice and comments will be appreciated .
let <m> n \geq 1 </m> be an integer . suppose <m> m \geq 2 n + 1 </m> is an integer . we construct the graph <m> \mathbb { Z } _ m = ( \mathbb { Z } / m \mathbb { Z } , E _ m ) </m> where <m> E _ m = \big \{ \{ x , y \} : x , y \in \mathbb { Z } / m \mathbb { Z } \text { a n d } \exists k \in \{ 1 , \ldots n \} : ( x + k = y \text { o r } y + k = x ) \big \} . </m> it is easy to see that <m> \mathbb { Z } _ m </m> is a <m> 2 n </m> - regular graph on <m> m </m> vertices . question . suppose <m> c </m> is the maximum chromatic number that a <m> 2 n </m> - regular graph on <m> m </m> vertices can have , and let <m> G = ( V , E ) </m> be a <m> 2 n </m> - regular graph with <m> | V | = m </m> and <m> \chi ( G ) = c </m> . does this imply that <m> G \cong \mathbb { Z } _ m </m> ?
i 've noticed that most of the work in ackermann set theory is primarily concerned with constructing sets in <m> V </m> , the rest of the classes are just excess material , carrying no comprehension over them . there is a try of muller in which he strengthen the class existence principle of ackermann into separation over classes , the resultant theory is <m> A </m> , and adding regularity <m> R </m> , and choice <m> C </m> , he gets into <m> A R C </m> , a theory claimed -LSB- see here -RSB- to serve as a foundation of both category and set theory , and thus for most of mathematics . this gave me the idea of reflecting-out of <m> V </m> principle , since ackermann 's set theory can be interpeted in systems using reflection -LSB- see here -RSB- , so if to any of the two systems appearing in that posting -LRB- with reflection in them re-named as reflection in <m> V </m> -RRB- , we add the following principle : reflection out of <m> V </m> schema : if <m> \varphi </m> is a sentence in <m> F O L ( = , \in ) </m> , i.e. does n't use the symbol <m> V </m> , and <m> \varphi ^ V </m> is the bounded by <m> V </m> sentence of <m> \varphi </m> , i.e. the sentence obtained by merely bounding every quantifier in <m> \varphi </m> by <m> V </m> , then : <m> \varphi ^ V \to \varphi </m> , is an axiom . in other words we are reversing the reflection process , so we are concluding things about classes in general by reflecting from the inside of <m> V </m> to outside it . by that , all set axioms -LRB- i.e. sentences in the language of set theory that are satisfied in <m> V </m> -RRB- , would generalize over all classes . this way we easily get to interpret muller 's theory .
with <m> p _ i </m> being the <m> i </m> - th prime , i 'm wondering whether there is a tighter bound than <m> \alpha = 4 </m> in the relation <m> \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ n p _ i < \alpha ^ { p _ n } </m> <m> \alpha = 4 </m> , which is tight enough to be used to prove bertrand 's postulate -LRB- chebyshev 's theorem -RRB- that there is always a prime in the interval <m> [ k , 2 k ] </m> , is easily proven using <m> \binom { 2 r } { r } < 4 ^ r </m> and the fact that any prime in the interval <m> [ n / 2 , n ] </m> will divide <m> \binom { 2 r } { r } < 4 ^ r </m> ; see the answer to https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1924453/show-that-p-1p-2-cdots-p-t4n however , that argument makes a couple of lavishly conservative statements , two of which are that since <m> p _ n </m> divides <m> \binom { 2 n } { n } </m> it must be less than <m> \binom { 2 n } { n } </m> , and that <m> \binom { 2 n } { n } < \sum _ k \binom { 2 n } { k } </m> . one might suspect that a smaller value of <m> \alpha </m> could suffice . numerical experimentation finds that for <m> n \leq 1 0 0 </m> , <m> \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ n p _ i < ( 2 . 6 2 ) ^ { p _ n } </m> but if you extend to <m> n = 1 0 0 0 </m> , you need to increase to <m> \alpha = 2 . 6 9 3 8 </m> . thus my question : is it known that no <m> \alpha < 4 </m> works in the inequality as <m> n \to \infty </m> , has there been a lower value demonstrated , or is this question completely open ? i would guess that this can be attacked using the prime number theorem , but fluctuations from that distribution become important for this bound .
in graham and kolesnik 's `` van der corput 's method of exponential sums '' they mention the results of watt -LRB- 1989 -RRB- who obtained <m> \zeta ( 1 / 2 + i t ) = O ( t ^ { 8 9 / 5 6 0 + \epsilon } ) </m> . is anyone aware of more recent improvements to this bound -LRB- and perhaps the methods involved -RRB- ?

i have the book `` handbook of computational group theory '' , by derek holt , and in it is a section on finding the transversal of a subgroup . recall a transversal of a subgroup <m> H </m> of <m> G </m> is a single representative from each of the cosets of <m> H </m> in <m> G </m> -LRB- either left or right cosets -RRB- . two methods are given to find a transversal without any theoretical guarantees , mentioning at worst case they involve a backtrack search through the elements of <m> G </m> . i 'll admit i have not studied the algorithms mentioned thoroughly , as there is a fair amount of prerequisite material regarding strongly generating sets and bases . however , the initial claim of requiring a full backtrack search through <m> G </m> seems unnecessary with an appropriate sized subgroup <m> H </m> if you allow a bit of randomness in your algorithm . namely , there are <m> O ( | G : H | ) </m> different cosets that need a single representative . randomly sampling from <m> G </m> can be seen as an application of coupon collecting . after <m> O ( | G : H | \log | G : H | ) </m> many samples , the expectation is that all cosets have been represented . to trim this to a proper transversal , we can keep a list of unique cosets and run the coset test as we sample elements , maintaining only one representative of each unique coset and stopping when <m> | G : H | </m> representatives have been found . to do this efficiently requires storing the elements of <m> H </m> in a dictionary . with <m> O ( 1 ) </m> time lookup , the above algorithm can be completed in <m> O ( | G : H | ^ 2 \log | G : H | + | H | ) </m> time , though it could possibly be made to be more efficient . in any case , if <m> H </m> is <m> o ( | G | ) </m> and <m> \omega ( \sqrt { | G | } ) </m> , then this algorithm is more efficient than a backtrack search through <m> G </m> . the algorithm is pretty obvious , so i 'm wondering why it 's not mentioned in the book . also , if there are any other good sources for transversal computation i would like to hear them . thanks .
suppose <m> X </m> is a smooth projective variety defined over an arbitrary algebraically closed field <m> k </m> , and consider the action of <m> \Sigma _ n </m> on the <m> n </m> - fold product <m> X ^ n </m> . is it true that <m> H _ { \acute { e } t } ^ i ( \mathrm { S y m } ^ n ( X ) , \mathbb { Q } _ \ell ) \cong H _ { \acute { e } t } ^ i ( X ^ n , \mathbb { Q } _ \ell ) ^ { \Sigma _ n } </m> ? in particular , what happens in the case where <m> \operatorname { c h a r } k = p > 0 </m> ? in grothendieck 's toh \ ^ oku paper sec. 5.2 , he determines sufficient conditions to ensure that , for a topological space <m> X </m> with a finite group <m> G </m> acting on it -LRB- not necessarily faithfully -RRB- , <m> H ^ i ( X / G , \mathcal { A } ) \cong H ^ i ( X , \mathcal { A } ) ^ G </m> for a sheaf <m> \mathcal { A } </m> -LRB- cor . to prop. 5.2.3 -RRB- . in characteristic zero , comparison theorems allow me to appeal to this result . in positive characteristic , if the variety lifts to characteristic zero , then i can make the same argument , but it seems like there ought to be a direct proof of this fact . i am particularly interested in when <m> X </m> is a surface , but would be happy to know of any general results -LRB- with references -RRB- similar to grothendieck 's result above .
let <m> S </m> be the surface of a compact , convex , smooth -LRB- <m> C ^ \infty </m> -RRB- body in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 3 </m> , with strictly positive gaussian curvature at every point of <m> S </m> . fix a direction <m> z </m> in a cartesian coordinate system , and consider all the lines parallel to <m> z </m> and tangent to <m> S </m> , which form a topological cylinder enclosing <m> S </m> , touching <m> S </m> on the shadow boundary resulting from a light source at <m> z = + \infty </m> -LRB- yellow in the figure below -RRB- . parametrize these lines from <m> s = 0 </m> to <m> s = 1 </m> around the cylinder , and let <m> h ( s ) </m> be the height of the point of tangency to <m> S </m> above the <m> x y </m> - plane , orthogonal to <m> z </m> . my question is :
automorphism group of <m> \Bbb Z \times \Bbb Z \times \Bbb Z </m> is <m> S L ( 3 , \Bbb Z ) </m> . i am wondering what the automorphism group of <m> ( \Bbb Z \times \Bbb Z ) \rtimes \Bbb Z </m> would be . generator c of <m> \Bbb Z </m> is <m> c \in A u t ( \Bbb Z \times \Bbb Z ) = S L ( 2 , Z ) </m> . so c can be taken to be either of the two generators of <m> S L ( 2 , Z ) </m> . this is towards the mapping class group calculation of a torus bundle over a circle with monodromy . so finally we are interested in <m> O u t ( ( \Bbb Z \times \Bbb Z ) \rtimes \Bbb Z ) </m> , if it makes it a simpler problem .
let <m> G = ( V , E ) </m> be a graph with minimum degree <m> \delta ( G ) = n \lt \aleph _ 0 </m> . does <m> G </m> necessarily have a spanning subgraph <m> G ' = ( V , E ' ) </m> which also has minimum degree <m> \delta ( G ' ) = n </m> and is minimal with that property ? this question is easily answered in the affirmative if <m> G </m> is locally finite or if <m> n \le 1 </m> . it already seems difficult for <m> n = 2 </m> , but i am not very clever and may be missing something obvious . the question also seems to make sense for hypergraphs : let <m> m , n \in \mathbb N </m> . let <m> E </m> be a family of sets , each of cardinality at most <m> m </m> . if <m> E </m> is an <m> n </m> - cover of a set <m> V </m> -LRB- each element of <m> V </m> is in at least <m> n </m> elements of <m> E </m> -RRB- , does <m> E </m> contain a minimal <m> n </m> - cover of <m> V </m> ? i would expect such simple questions to have been asked and answered 100 years ago . where are these questions considered in the literature ? p.s. the following proof for the simple case of a -LRB- non-hyper -RRB- graph with <m> \delta = 1 </m> is probably a dead end , as it does not seem to generalize in any obvious way . i 'm putting it here anyway because it 's quite simple . theorem . a graph with no isolated points has a minimal spanning subgraph with no isolated points . proof . let <m> G </m> be a graph with no isolated points . let <m> H </m> be a maximal spanning subgraph of <m> G </m> not containing <m> K _ 3 </m> or <m> P _ 4 </m> as a subgraph , induced or otherwise . then <m> H </m> is a star-forest , possibly with some isolated points . for each isolated vertex <m> v </m> of <m> H </m> , choose an edge of <m> G </m> which is incident with <m> v </m> and add it to <m> H </m> . this results in a spanning subgraph of <m> G </m> in which each component is a nontrivial tree of radius at most <m> 2 </m> . the proof is completed by observing that any nontrivial tree of radius at most <m> 2 </m> has a spanning subgraph with no isolated points .
i have a -LRB- basic ? -RRB- question in topology . question 1 . is it possible to characterise compact <m> 4 </m> - manifolds <m> M ^ 4 </m> , such that almost complex structures on <m> M ^ 4 </m> are uniquely defined up to homotopy by their first chern classes ? or is there at least a large class of <m> 4 </m> - manifolds where this is true ? maybe there is a reference ? recall the theorem of wu . denote by <m> \tau </m> the signature of <m> M ^ 4 </m> and by <m> e </m> the euler characteristics . then for any element <m> c \in H ^ 2 ( M ^ 4 , \mathbb Z ) </m> with <m> c ^ 2 = 3 \tau + 2 e </m> and such that <m> c \; { \rm m o d } \; \mathbb Z _ 2 = w _ 2 \in H ^ 2 ( M ^ 4 , \mathbb Z _ 2 ) </m> there is an almost complex structure <m> J </m> on <m> M ^ 4 </m> , such that <m> c _ 1 ( M , J ) = c </m> -LRB- in particular , as paul says <m> e + \tau = 0 \; { \rm m o d } \; 4 </m> -RRB- . however this <m> J </m> might be non-unique , up to homotopy among almost complex structures with <m> c _ 1 = c </m> , as the following example shows . example . let <m> M ^ 4 = S ^ 1 \times S ^ 3 </m> , then the tangent bundle is trivial , so almost complex structures on <m> M ^ 4 </m> can be identified up to homotopy with homotopy classes of maps <m> M ^ 4 \to S ^ 2 </m> -LRB- see page 11 in the geometry of four-manifolds donaldson kronheimer -RRB- . maps <m> S ^ 3 \to S ^ 2 </m> can have different hopf invariants , but <m> c _ 1 = 0 </m> since <m> S ^ 1 \times S ^ 3 </m> has no second cohomology ... added question 2 . is there at least one manifold that satisfies condition of question 1 ? in mcduff-salamon -LRB- footnote on page 120 -RRB- it is written , that if <m> M ^ 4 </m> is spin then there are precisely two homotopy classes of <m> J </m> with given <m> c _ 1 </m> -LRB- this is said to be related to <m> \pi _ 4 ( S ^ 2 ) = \mathbb Z _ 2 </m> -RRB- . but since <m> S ^ 1 \times S ^ 3 </m> is spin this statement from mcduff-salamon seem to contradict to my conclusion -LRB- that for <m> S ^ 1 \times S ^ 3 </m> homotopy classes are can have different hopf invariants -RRB- . so , where is the mistake ? ... :-RRB-
for a quaternion algebra <m> D </m> , introduce the quaternionic similitude unitary groups : <m> \mathrm { G U } _ D = \left \{ g \in \mathrm { G L } ( D ) \ : \ g ^ \star \left ( \begin {array} { c c } & 1 \\ 1 & \end {array} \right ) g = \mu ( g ) \left ( \begin {array} { c c } & 1 \\ 1 & \end {array} \right ) , \mu ( g ) \in \mathbf { G } _ m \right \} </m> the <m> \mathrm { G U } _ D </m> are the inner forms of <m> \mathrm { G S p ( 4 ) } </m> when <m> D </m> describes the quaternion algebras . for almost every places <m> v </m> of <m> F </m> , more precisely the split ones , this group is <m> G _ v \simeq \mathrm { G S p ( 4 , F _ v ) } </m> .
i am trying to derive a closed form for computing the number possible outcomes of rolling <m> k </m> dices such that the sum is <m> n </m> . this seems to be the problem of finding number of positive integral solution of an equation <m> x _ 1 + x _ 2 + \cdots + x _ k = n </m> with <m> x _ 1 , x _ 2 , \cdots , x _ n \in [ 1 , 6 ] </m> , but here a solution <m> ( a , a , a , a , \cdots \text { k - t i m e s } ) </m> is not considered different . direct application of stars and bars gives a closed form <m> \binom { n - 1 } { 2 } \times k \binom { n - 7 } { 2 } </m> but this is not working for all the cases , for example the case of <m> n = 1 6 </m> and <m> k = 3 </m> , what exactly should i modify in my approach ? similar -LRB- but particular -RRB- question in m.se .
let <m> A </m> be an algebra over a field k. a module <m> _ A M </m> is called a generator if <m> \textrm { a d d } ( A ) \subseteq \textrm { a d d } ( M ) </m> , a cogenerator if <m> \textrm { a d d } \big ( D ( A ) \big ) \subseteq \textrm { a d d } ( M ) </m> . <m> M </m> is <m> n </m> - rigid if <m> \textrm { E x t } _ A ^ i ( M , M ) = 0 </m> for <m> 1 \leq i \leq n </m> . now suppose <m> _ A M </m> is a generator-cogenerator which is <m> n </m> - rigid and neither projective nor injective . <m> \Lambda : = \textrm { E n d } _ A ( M ) </m> . if <m> \Lambda </m> is at most <m> ( n + m + 2 ) </m> - gorenstein , that is the injective dimension <m> \textrm { i n j . d i m } ( _ { \Lambda } \Lambda ) = \textrm { i n j . d i m } ( \Lambda _ { \Lambda } ) \leq ( n + m + 2 ) </m> , then for any <m> \Lambda </m> - module <m> N </m> , how to get that <m> \Omega ^ 2 _ { \Lambda } ( N ) \cong \textrm { H o m } _ A ( M , Y ) </m> for some <m> A </m> - module <m> Y </m> -LRB- here , <m> \Omega </m> is the syzygy functor -RRB- ?
could anyone give a non-trivial example of a bundle-mapping over <m> S ^ 4 </m> , i.e. find two complex rank 2 vector bundles <m> E _ 0 , E _ 1 </m> over <m> S ^ 4 </m> and a bundle mapping <m> 0 \to E _ 0 \overset { v } { \to } E _ 1 \to 0 </m> such that the singularity set of <m> v </m> -LRB- where <m> v </m> is not an isomorphic mapping -RRB- is equal to the embedding sphere <m> S ^ 2 </m> of <m> S ^ 4 </m> ?
it is well known that the lie group <m> S p i n ( 9 ) </m> acts on the vector space <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { 1 6 } </m> -LRB- see e.g. harvey 's book `` spinors and calibrations '' . -RRB- it is convenient to identify this vector space with the octonionic plane <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { 1 6 } \simeq \mathbb { O } ^ 2 </m> . question . with this identifications , i would like to write down generators of the lie algebra <m> s p i n ( 9 ) </m> as explicitly as possible . a reference would be helpful .
let <m> X = M \times \{ 0 , 1 \} </m> with <m> M </m> a smooth compact manifold without boundary . define the fractional sobolev space <m> H ^ { \frac 1 2 } ( X ) = ( L ^ 2 ( X ) , H ^ 1 ( X ) ) _ { \frac 1 2 } </m> , as the real interpolation space midway between <m> H ^ 1 </m> and <m> L ^ 2 </m> . is it true that <m> \lVert u \rVert _ { H ^ { \frac 1 2 } ( X ) } ^ 2 = \lVert u ( \cdot , 0 ) \rVert _ { H ^ { \frac 1 2 } ( M ) } ^ 2 + \lVert u ( \cdot , 1 ) \rVert _ { H ^ { \frac 1 2 } ( M ) } ^ 2 </m> whenever <m> u \in H ^ { \frac 1 2 } ( X ) </m> ? the norm is defined through the interpolation method -LRB- say the j method -RRB- . it seems intuitively true but i do n't see how to make it rigorous ?
let <m> \mathbf A </m> and <m> \mathbf B </m> be dg-categories over a field , viewed as <m> A _ \infty </m> - categories . the <m> A _ \infty </m> - category -LRB- actually , dg-category -RRB- of strictly unital <m> A _ \infty </m> - functors <m> \mathbf A \to \mathbf B </m> will be denoted by <m> \mathrm { F u n } _ \infty ( \mathbf A , \mathbf B ) </m> . it is described explicitly -LRB- in the non-unital case -RRB- for example in p. seidel 's book -LRB- `` fukaya category and picard-lefschetz theory '' -RRB- . let <m> \Delta ^ 1 </m> be the <m> 1 </m> - simplex category , namely , the linear category freely generated over the diagram <m> 0 \to 1 </m> . call <m> \mathrm { M o r } ( \mathbf B ) = \mathrm { F u n } _ \infty ( \Delta ^ 1 , \mathbf B ) </m> . it can be described explicitly as the dg-category of morphisms in <m> \mathbf B </m> , see for example `` internal homs via extensions of dg functors '' by canonaco and stellari , after remark 2.9 . there are natural source and target dg-functors <m> S , T \colon \mathrm { M o r } ( \mathbf { B } ) \to \mathbf B </m> . now , i would like to prove that closed degree <m> 0 </m> morphisms <m> F \to G </m> of <m> \mathrm { F u n } _ \infty ( \mathbf A , \mathbf B ) </m> are in bijection with <m> A _ \infty </m> - functors <m> \varphi \colon \mathbf A \to \mathrm { M o r } ( \mathbf B ) </m> such that <m> S \circ \varphi = F </m> and <m> T \circ \varphi = G </m> . that is , morphisms of <m> A _ \infty </m> - functors are represented by `` directed homotopies '' . i think that this result is quite tautological if one employs the concrete definitions contained in seidel 's book ; the real pain is called sign conventions . if someone knows a conceptual argument which proves this , or - even better - has a reference somewhere , it would be of great help . thanks in advance !
given a set of points in <m> X </m> axis , we want to cover them with minimum number of unit intervals . for this problem we can assume that each interval in the optimal solution is starting or ending in one of the points . how can we extend this assumption to the higher dimensions ? for example given a set of points in <m> d </m> dimensions and we want to cover them with <m> d </m> - dimensional unit disks , can we specify the disks in optimal solution to the finite size -LRB- constant to <m> n </m> and maybe polynomial or exponential to <m> d </m> -RRB- set ?

-LSB- this is a duplicate of this question on stackexchange -RSB- i am trying to figure out how to prove a very basic statement about convolution of <m> \ell </m> - adic/perverse sheaves in katz 's `` rigid local systems '' -LRB- section 2.5.3 , -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- . the fact is fairly obvious and i guess that the proof is purely formal , but i 'm not sure about it since my knowledge of the schemes formalism is quite limited . settings : <m> G / k </m> is a -LRB- smooth , separated -RRB- group scheme over a field <m> k </m> , of pure relative dimension <m> d </m> . denote <m> \mu : G \times _ k G \rightarrow G </m> the multiplication map and <m> e : k \rightarrow G </m> the identity section . for <m> K </m> , <m> L \in D ^ b _ c ( G , \overline { \mathbb { Q } _ l } ) </m> -LRB- the `` derived category '' of <m> \ell </m> - adic sheaves over <m> G </m> , <m> l \neq \text { c h a r } ( p ) </m> -RRB- define the product <m> K \times L \in D ^ b _ c ( G \times _ k G , \overline { \mathbb { Q } _ l } ) </m> as <m> K \times L : = p r _ 1 ^ { * } K \otimes ^ { \mathbf { L } } p r _ 2 ^ { * } L </m> with <m> p r _ 1 </m> , <m> p r _ 2 </m> the canonical projections <m> G \times _ k G \rightarrow G </m> , and <m> \otimes ^ { \mathbf { L } } </m> the derived tensor product , which i 'll just denote by <m> \otimes </m> in the following . now define their <m> \star _ { * } </m> convolution as <m> K \star _ { * } L : = R \mu _ { * } ( K \times L ) \in D ^ b _ c ( G , \overline { \mathbb { Q } _ l } ) </m> the claim is that , if <m> G </m> is commutative , then the <m> \star _ { * } </m> convolution is commutative . what i did : we want to show that if <m> K </m> , <m> L \in D ^ b _ c ( G , \overline { \mathbb { Q } _ l } ) </m> , then <m> R \mu _ { * } ( K \times L ) = R \mu _ { * } ( L \times K ) </m> , i.e. , as <m> \otimes </m> is commutative , that <m> R \mu _ { * } ( p r _ 1 ^ * K \otimes p r _ 2 ^ * L ) = R \mu _ { * } ( p r _ 2 ^ * K \otimes p r _ 1 ^ * L ) </m>
i 'm sure that this is classical -- but can anyone provide a reasonable example of an <m> L ^ \infty ( \mathbb { T } ) </m> function whose fourier series is <m> \ell ^ 2 </m> but no better ? not even <m> L ^ 2 \log L </m> ? presumably one exists but nothing has come to my mind . i 'm trying to understand just how far one can stretch a -LRB- version of a -RRB- particular conjecture on boolean functions , the fourier entropy-influence conjecture .

let <m> M \subset \mathbf R ^ n </m> be a -LRB- smooth -RRB- submanifold of dimension <m> d </m> . under which conditions does there exist global equations defining <m> M </m> ? by global equations i mean : does there exist a smooth function <m> f : \mathbf R ^ n \to \mathbf R ^ { n - d } </m> , submersive at each point of <m> M </m> and such that <m> M = f ^ { - 1 } ( 0 ) </m> . of course there are two necessary conditions : 1 -RRB- <m> M </m> must be a closed subset of <m> \mathbf R ^ n </m> . 2 -RRB- the normal bundle of <m> M </m> in <m> \mathbf R ^ n </m> must be trivial . at first , i would have guessed that these conditions are sufficient , but i ca n't prove it . i have partial answers , however . 1 -RRB- the first natural thing to do is to take a tubular neighbourhood <m> U </m> of <m> M </m> in <m> \mathbf R ^ n </m> . the indentification <m> U \simeq M \times \mathbf R ^ { n - d } </m> allows to define a function <m> f : U \to \mathbf R ^ { n - d } </m> which has the required properties . but it is not clear to me whether <m> f </m> can be extended to the whole <m> \mathbf R ^ n </m> . 2 -RRB- there is a way to give an answer if we change a bit the problem : the pontryagin-thom construction gives a function <m> f : \mathbf R ^ n \to \widehat { \mathbf R ^ { n - d } } \simeq \mathrm S ^ { n - d } </m> by sending all the points outside a tubular neighbourhood at infinity . this maybe means that this is the good formulation of the problem , but i am still curious about the original one . 3 -RRB- if <m> M </m> has codimension <m> 1 </m> , then the function <m> f </m> defined on a tubular neighbourhood <m> U </m> of <m> M </m> as in 1 -RRB- can actually be extended to <m> \mathbf R ^ n </m> by a constant function -LRB- using the fact that the complement of <m> M </m> has two connected components -RRB- .

let <m> G </m> be a reductive algebraic group . let <m> X </m> be a <m> G </m> - variety and consider any closed subvariety <m> Z </m> of <m> X </m> . since any <m> g \in G </m> acts as an automorphism , we know that <m> g . Z </m> is again a closed subvariety of <m> X </m> . this yields an action of <m> G </m> on the free module of cycles of <m> X </m> which should induce an action of <m> G </m> on the chow ring of <m> X </m> . the invariants of this ring should be precisely the classes that correspond to linear combinations of <m> G </m> - orbits . has this action been studied before ? any kind of reference would be very welcome . thanks ! edit : it looks like my above idea is rather futile , so let me ask more broadly : are there any techniques or results in intersection theory specifically on <m> G </m> - varieties ? could you name some references ?
how many elements of <m> \mathrm { S L } _ n ( \mathbb { F } _ p ) </m> have all nonzero entries ? just the answer mod <m> p </m> would be fine as well . this seems like it should be easy/in the literature but i could n't find it .

let <m> \Omega </m> be a bounded domain in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> . let <m> u \in L ^ 2 ( 0 , T ; V ) </m> be the weak solution of the heat equation <m> u _ t - \Delta u = 0 </m> <m> u ( 0 ) = u _ 0 </m> where <m> u _ 0 </m> is bounded initial data . here either <m> V = H ^ 1 _ 0 ( \Omega ) </m> or <m> v = H ^ 1 ( \Omega ) </m> and we take zero neumann data . how may i prove an <m> L ^ \infty - L ^ 1 </m> smoothing effect of this form : <m> \lVert u ( t ) \rVert _ { L ^ \infty } \leq C t ^ { - \gamma } \lVert u _ 0 \rVert _ { L ^ 1 } ^ \alpha </m> for all <m> t > 0 </m> ? i have seen a proof when we have the porous medium equation , but it is complicated -LRB- even when picking the linear case -RRB- so i wondered if there is an easier method . maybe something using sobolev inequalities .
a colleague of mine found the following linear relation between values at 1 of the <m> _ 3 F _ 2 </m> hypergeometric function using a very indirect argument . i am aware that there are myriads of such relations , but this one seems to be of a new type . any help on finding a direct proof -LRB- just out of curiosity -RRB- ? let <m> T _ 1 = { } _ 3 F _ 2 ( 1 , 1 , 1 ; a , a ; 1 ) </m> , <m> T _ 2 = { } _ 3 F _ 2 ( 2 , 1 , 1 ; a + 1 , a + 1 ; 1 ) </m> , <m> T _ 3 = { } _ 3 F _ 2 ( 2 a - 1 , 1 , 1 ; a + 1 , a + 1 ; 1 ) </m> . then for <m> a > 3 / 2 </m> we have <m> ( 2 a - 3 ) T _ 1 + \dfrac { ( a - 1 ) ^ 2 } { a ^ 2 } ( T _ 2 - 2 ( a - 1 ) T _ 3 ) = \dfrac { \Gamma ( a ) ^ 2 } { \Gamma ( 2 a - 2 ) } </m>
i have a question about a `` standard '' variant of the reidemeister-schreier algorithm used by topologists when manipulating manifolds they either know or suspect are fibre-bundles over <m> S ^ 1 </m> . say you have a manifold <m> M </m> , and you have computed a finite presentation for <m> \pi _ 1 M </m> , and you also have an onto homomorphism <m> \pi _ 1 M \to \mathbb Z </m> . we want to determine if the kernel is a finitely-presented group , and if it is , to write <m> \pi _ 1 M </m> explicitly as a semi-direct product of this group with <m> \mathbb Z </m> . one way to attempt this would be to lift a cw-structure for <m> M </m> up to the corresponding covering space , then collapse a maximal tree in the <m> 1 </m> - skeleton . this gives an infinite presentation of the fundamental group of the homotopy fibre of the corresponding map <m> M \to S ^ 1 </m> . at this point -LRB- in practice -RRB- people just follow their noses and observe that this infinite presentation reduces to a finite sub-presentation . for example , you could modify your presentation of <m> \pi _ 1 M </m> so that precisely one of your generators is mapped to a non-trivial element of <m> \mathbb Z </m> . your maximal tree is then just concatenations of the lift of this non-trivial element 's 1-cell . then the game becomes looking at the lift of the 2-cells , and hoping you can find such 2-cells that allow you to do 1-cell cancelling moves . to do this quite literally you need 2-cells whose lift contain unique instances of `` highest weight '' 1-cells -LRB- similarly unique lowest weight -RRB- . this would allow you to mimic -LRB- quite literally -RRB- things like buchburger 's algorithm for finding groebner basis , to inductively remove all but finitely-many 1-cells and get to a finite presentation . perhaps some of your 1-cells ca n't be eliminated because your relators do not have them as unique highest/lowest weight instances , but then you could perhaps modify your relators to find new ones that do . so one could make this into a fairly elaborate game . are there known more sophisticated algorithms out there , or do you know if people tend to find the above sufficient for most circumstances ? perhaps people know the above is essentially the best one can do ? any references would be helpful .
let <m> L ( C , s ) = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { a _ n } { n ^ s } </m> be the dirichlet series of the hasse -- weil l-function of an elliptic curve <m> C </m> over <m>  </m> . as <m> s </m> takes on real negative values , there are trivial zeros at the integers <m> m </m> . the sign of <m> L </m> changes as we pass through a zero . we can also check this property : -LRB- p -RRB- <m> | L ( - m + 1 / 2 ) | </m> gets large as <m> m </m> gets large . my question is : does the property -LRB- p -RRB- holds true for the derivatives of <m> L </m> , namely , <m> L ^ { ( k ) } , k = 1 , 2 , . . . </m> ? more generally , if <m> L ( C , s ) </m> assumes arbitrarily large and arbitrarily small values , i.e. , for all <m> K > 0 </m> , there are <m> a , b </m> with <m> L ( C , a ) < K </m> and <m> L ( C , b ) > K </m> . does this property holds true for its derivatives ?
as the title suggests , my question is devoted to understand -LRB- and maybe get some good references -RRB- the relation between the igusa tower for a modular curves and <m> p </m> , or maybe <m> T </m> - adic modular forms . i post this question since i am reading andreatta , iovita and pilloni 's paper `` le halo spectral '' , where , first of all , they construct a sheaf whose global sections should produce a theory of overconvergent <m> T </m> - adic modular forms . in chapter <m> 4 </m> of that paper , the construction goes approximately as follows . first they consider level <m> N \geq 3 </m> modular curve <m> X </m> over <m> \mathbb { F } _ p </m> , <m> ( p , N ) = 1 </m> and its ordinary locus <m> X _ { o r d } </m> defined as the complement of the vanishing locus of the hasse invariant . over the ordinary locus it is well defined the igusa tower , which parametrizes , as a moduli space , the trivializations of the dual of the kernel of frobenius . now , they consider , for a given character <m> \kappa : \mathbb { Z } _ p ^ \ast \rightarrow \mathbb { C } _ p ^ \ast </m> the etale <m> \phi </m> - module given by katz , which in this case has the fordddm <m> \mathcal { O } _ { \mathcal { I G } _ \infty } [ \kappa ^ { - 1 } ] </m> , where <m> \mathcal { I G } _ \infty </m> is the projective limit of the igusa tower . this sheaf is essentially the sheaf of functions over the igusa tower , defined over the base change of the ordinary locus to <m> \mathbb { F } [ [ T ] ] </m> which transform via the inverse of <m> \kappa </m> under the action of <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p ^ \ast </m> . in the rest of the chapter they show that this construction overconverges in a neighborhood of the ordinary locus , and they define integral overconvergent modular forms as global sections of that sheaf , which is invertible over the suitable neighborhood of the ordinary locus . now , the point is , how does the igusa tower relates to the usual definition of overconvergent modular forms , say functions defined over suitable triples of elliptic curves with growth conditions ? how is it possible to compute global sections of that sheaf involved in the construction ? say , is it possible to find a suitable basis , as in katz ? thank you for any suggestion or also reference and sorry if my question is maybe too vague !
given a smooth manifold <m> M </m> , there is a vector bundle over <m> M </m> , denoted <m> \tau M </m> , known as the second-order tangent bundle . the fiber <m> \tau _ m M </m> at <m> m \in M </m> is the collection of linear operators <m> A _ m : C ^ \infty ( M ) \rightarrow \mathbb { R } </m> that satisfy <m> A _ m ( f ^ 3 ) = 3 f ( m ) A _ m ( f ^ 2 ) - 3 f ^ 2 ( m ) A _ m ( f ) </m> for each <m> f \in C ^ \infty ( M ) </m> . it is n't too hard to show that each section of <m> \tau M </m> is locally of the form <m> A _ m = a ^ i ( m ) \partial _ i + b ^ { i j } ( m ) \partial ^ 2 _ { i j } , </m> where <m> a ^ i </m> and <m> b ^ { i j } </m> are smooth functions , <m> b ^ { i j } = b ^ { j i } </m> , <m> \partial _ i = \frac { \partial } { \partial x ^ i } </m> , <m> \partial ^ 2 _ { i j } = \frac { \partial ^ 2 } { \partial x ^ i \partial x ^ j } </m> , and i 'm using the einstein summation convention . for each <m> m \in M </m> there is a short exact sequence <m> T _ m M \rightarrow \tau _ m M \rightarrow T _ m M \odot T _ m M </m> where <m> \odot </m> denotes the symmetric tensor product . the first arrow is the inclusion map that sends a vector at <m> m </m> to its corresponding directional derivative operator <m> C ^ \infty ( M ) \rightarrow \mathbb { R } </m> . the second arrow is given by <m> A _ m \mapsto \hat { A } _ m </m> , where <m> \hat { A } _ m </m> is defined by the formula <m> \hat { A } _ m ( \mathbf { d } _ m f , \mathbf { d } _ m g ) = A _ m ( f g ) - f ( m ) A _ m ( g ) - g ( m ) A _ m ( f ) , </m> and <m> f , g \in C ^ \infty ( M ) </m> . my question : one way to split the sequence , and thereby identify <m> \tau M </m> with <m> T M \oplus ( T M \odot T M ) </m> , is to assign to each <m> m \in M </m> a subspace <m> S _ m \subset \tau _ m M </m> that is complementary to <m> T _ m M \subset \tau _ m M </m> . is there a name for such an assignment ? i 'd just like to know if there is an established name so that i can more easily search for what people already know about such things .
suppose <m> G </m> is a locally compact group and <m> H </m> is an open subgroup for simplicity . further suppose <m> \pi </m> is a representation of <m> H </m> on some hilbert space <m> \mathcal { H } _ { \pi } </m> , i.e. <m> \pi ( h ) </m> is unitary for all <m> h \in H </m> , <m> \pi </m> is weakly continuous and <m> \pi </m> is also a homomorphism . to induce a representation on <m> G </m> from <m> H </m> , it is natural to consider the usual action of <m> G </m> : as translation of functions on <m> G </m> . <m> H </m> however acts naturally on <m> \mathcal { H } _ { \pi } </m> by <m> \pi </m> . the way to marry these two notions in a self-consistent manner in order to induce a representation on <m> G </m> is to consider those <m> f : G \to \mathcal { H } _ { \pi } </m> such that <m> f ( g h ) = \pi ( h ^ { - 1 } ) f ( g ) </m> . such <m> f </m> are `` constant '' on cosets of <m> H _ { \pi } </m> in <m> G </m> - more precisely , <m> \| f ( \cdot ) \| </m> is constant on cosets . from this , we can define a hilbert space <m> \mathcal { H } ( G , \pi ) </m> : <m> \mathcal { H } ( G , \pi ) = \{ f : G \to \mathcal { H } _ { \pi } : f ( g h ) = \pi ( h ^ { - 1 } ) f ( g ) , \; \sum _ { g ' H \in G / H } \| f ( g ' ) \| ^ 2 < \infty \} </m> with the natural inner product given by <m> \langle f _ 1 , f _ 2 \rangle = \sum _ { g H \in G / H } \langle f _ 1 ( g ) , f _ 2 ( g ) \rangle . </m> from here we can finally define the induced representation <m> \text { i n d } _ H ^ G \pi : G \rightarrow U ( \mathcal { H } ( G , \pi ) ) </m> : <m> \text { i n d } _ H ^ G \pi ( g ) f ( \cdot ) = f ( g ^ { - 1 } \cdot ) . </m> it is not hard to see that this is indeed a homomorphism and that it is unitary . however it is not necessary that <m> \pi </m> be a homomorphism in order for <m> \text { i n d } _ H ^ G \pi </m> to be a homomorphism . this is not surprising since we are just acting by left translation . the weak continuity of <m> \pi </m> seems necessary to keep in order for <m> \text { i n d } _ H ^ G \pi </m> to be weakly continuous since weak continuity is not guaranteed for a unitary homomorphism -LRB- pathological things may yet happen -RRB- . the only place in which <m> \pi </m> being a homomorphism plays a role is in showing that <m> \text { i n d } _ H ^ G \pi </m> is in fact weakly continuous . the role is also quite minor in the proof . is it possible to omit that the assumption that <m> \pi </m> be a homomorphism and still have <m> \text { i n d } _ H ^ G \pi </m> be a representation ? just because it is used to prove that <m> \text { i n d } _ H ^ G \pi </m> is weakly continuous does not mean it is a necessary condition .
i was wondering what the condition is for the restriction map -LRB- in group cohomology -RRB- <m> H ^ i ( G , A ) \to H ^ i ( H , A ) </m> to be surjective . i am a little confused about when maps between cohomology groups are considered to be <m> G </m> - , <m> H </m> - or <m> G / H </m> - module homomorphisms . in particular , in the exact sequence of low degrees <m> 0 \to H ^ 1 ( G / H , A ^ H ) \to H ^ 1 ( G , A ) \to H ^ 1 ( H , A ) ^ { G / H } \to H ^ 2 ( G / H , A ^ H ) \to H ^ 2 ( G , A ) </m> are the maps all meant to be <m> G </m> - module homomorphisms ? edit : does someone have an example when <m> \mathrm { r e s } </m> is not surjective ?
the function <m> \text { L i } </m> -LRB- logarithmic integral -RRB- is defined for <m> x > 0 </m> by <m> \text { L i } ( x ) = \int _ 2 ^ { x } \frac { d t } { \ln t } . </m> the prime number theorem , proven by hadamard and de la vallée-poussin in 1896 asserts that <m> ( x ) \sim \text { L i } ( x ) </m> when <m> x </m> goes to <m> + \infty </m> where <m>  </m> p <m>  </m> it was proven by j. littlewood in 1914 that the difference <m> d ( x ) = \text { L i } ( x ) - ( x ) </m> changes sign an infinite number of times , although for <m> x \le 1 0 ^ { 2 5 } </m> , <m> d ( x ) > 0 </m> . -LRB- i guess that the <m> 1 0 ^ { 2 5 } </m> could be enlarged . -RRB- i think that it is also known that for <m> x </m> quite large , say in the interval <m> [ 1 0 ^ { 3 0 0 } , 1 0 ^ { 5 0 0 } ] </m> , there exists <m> x </m> such that <m> d ( x ) < 0 </m> . thanks to the answers below , i have understood that there is no explicit value of <m> x </m> for which we know that <m> d ( x ) < 0 </m> . a related question : is it true that for <m> x </m> large enough <m> ( x ) \ge \frac { x } { \ln x } ? </m>
what is the best way to show , that <m> L e x ( \mathcal { A } , \mathcal { A b } ) </m> is abelian , where <m> \mathcal { A } </m> is an abelian category and <m> \mathcal { A b } </m> is the category of abelian groups from scratch ? there is the canonical inclusion functor <m> S \colon L e x ( \mathcal { A } , \mathcal { A b } ) \rightarrow F u n c ( \mathcal { A } , \mathcal { A b } ) </m> , which should have a nice left-adjoint <m> T </m> -LRB- somehow like sheafication -RRB- . how does one construct this ? what is the kernel of the left-adjoint ? i think this left adjoint should be exact and <m> T \circ S \cong i d _ { L e x ( \mathcal { A } , \mathcal { A b } ) } </m> , such that <m> L e x ( \mathcal { A } , \mathcal { A b } ) </m> is equivalent to the gabriel quotient <m> F u n c ( \mathcal { A } , \mathcal { A b } ) / k e r ( T ) </m> . i would be glad if i get some answers to this questions , but i would love to hear some references from you , with wich i can prove this rigorously . thanks .
let <m> K </m> be a nonarchimedean local field of residue characteristic <m> p \neq l </m> and let <m> I _ K </m> be the inertia subgroup of its absolute galois group . let <m> V </m> an irreducible representation of <m> I _ K </m> over <m> \overline { \mathbb { F } } _ l </m> with finite image <m> I </m> . suppose that <m> V </m> is primitive , i.e. , is not induced from a proper subgroup of <m> I </m> . under these assumptions , could it happen that <m> I </m> has an element of order <m> l </m> ? in case it is of relevance : when restricted to the wild inertia such a <m> V </m> remains irreducible and hence in particular is of <m> p </m> - power dimension .
let <m> ( S , \cdot ) </m> be a semigroup and <m> W \subseteq S </m> be a subset . let me call <m> W </m> `` tile '' if the following property is satisfied : there exist <m> s _ 1 , . . . s _ k \in S </m> such that the sets <m> s _ i \cdot W </m> are pairwise disjoint and cover <m> S </m> . for instance , tiles for the semigroup <m> ( \mathbb N , + ) </m> are given by the multiples of some fixed natural number . here is my question : is there any explicit example of tile for the semigroup <m> ( \mathbb N , \cdot ) </m> ? a literature remark : i do not know if the notion of `` tile '' is already defined/used somewhere . i know the existence of `` syndetic sets '' that are pretty similar but different . i hope you like the name `` tile '' ! thanks in advance , valerio if someone of you wants to know more specifically my problem : let <m> ( S , \cdot ) </m> be a countable amenable semigroup and let <m> W \subset S </m> be a subset . let me denote by <m> \chi _ W </m> the characteristic function of <m> W </m> and define the following numbers <m> W ^ - = \inf [ f ( \chi _ W ) , f \text { b i - i n v a r i a n t m e a n } ] </m> <m> W ^ + = \sup [ f ( \chi _ W ) , f \text { b i - i n v a r i a n t m e a n } ] </m> i am first of all interested in the case <m> W ^ - = W ^ + </m> -LRB- this is why i 'm interested in tiles -RRB- . that would be the case when one can define some notion of intrinsic probability of the set <m> W </m> . then it would be nice to find some description for the number <m> W ^ + - W ^ - </m> and hopefully finding how the numbers <m> f ( \chi _ W ) </m> are distributed into the interval <m> [ W ^ - , W ^ + ] </m> .
given <m> n </m> points <m> p _ 1 , \dots , p _ n </m> in <m> S ^ 2 </m> one gets a product link <m> L _ n = \{ p _ 1 , \dots , p _ n \} \times S ^ 1 </m> inside the closed 3-manifold <m> S ^ 2 \times S ^ 1 </m> , which can be looked at as a trivially framed link -LRB- by picking a tangent vector <m> v _ i </m> at each <m> p _ i </m> and dragging it along the factor <m> S ^ 1 </m> to get the framing -RRB- . i 'm interested in the result of the surgery of <m> S ^ 2 \times S ^ 1 </m> along <m> L _ n </m> . is it diffeomorphic to some `` space with a name '' -LRB- e.g. , <m> S ^ 3 </m> , <m> S ^ 1 \times S ^ 1 \times S ^ 1 </m> , a lens space , etc ? -RRB- i 'm interested in the answer for an explict computation of a reshetikhin-turaev invariant i 'm faced with . yet , the problem is purely topological and i expect there is well known answer , but i have n't been able to find it or work it out myself so far .
edit : perhaps a more reasonable question after thinking about the answer i got would have been . is there a set <m> N </m> of measure <m> 1 - \varepsilon </m> and a disjoint partition of that set <m> N </m> with finitely many disjoint sets <m> I _ i </m> such that each of them contains an <m> x </m> for which <m> \left \lvert \left \lvert I _ n \right \rvert ^ { - 1 } \int _ { I _ n } f ( s ) d s - f ( x ) \right \rvert \le \varepsilon ? </m> end edit . the differentiation theorem teaches us that for a <m> L ^ 1 _ { l o c } </m> function <m> \frac { 1 } { B ( x , R ) } \int _ { B ( x , R ) } f ( s ) d s \rightarrow f ( x ) </m> almost everywhere . now consider a lebesgue integrable function on the interval <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> and the partition <m> I _ n ^ k = [ k / n , ( k + 1 ) / n ] </m> for <m> k = 0 , . . , n - 1 . </m> uniform rational case : i would like to ask whether for all <m> \varepsilon > 0 </m> there exists a natural number <m> n </m> such that for all <m> I _ n ^ k </m> there is an <m> x \in I _ n ^ k </m> such that <m> \left \lvert n \int _ { I _ n ^ k } f ( s ) d s - f ( x ) \right \rvert \le \varepsilon . </m> uniform real case : is the assumption of disjoint intervals <m> I _ { \delta } ^ k </m> of same size <m> \delta </m> where <m> \delta > 0 </m> is an arbitrary real number stronger ? - of course in this case , we do not always exactly cover <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> but you may assume that the function actually lives on <m> [ 0 , 2 ] </m> for convenience . and even less restrictive : is there any finite disjoint partition of intervals <m> I _ n </m> of <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> such that each of them contains an <m> x </m> for which <m> \left \lvert \left \lvert I _ n \right \rvert ^ { - 1 } \int _ { I _ n } f ( s ) d s - f ( x ) \right \rvert \le \varepsilon ? </m>
this question has now been published in a math journal , see update at the bottom . i posted the following question more than two years ago on mo -LRB- and then reposted on mse -RRB- , but the answer remains incomplete , so i thought i would rephrase it a bit -LRB- to make the statement clearer -RRB- and try again . let <m> \omega _ 1 </m> be the first uncountable ordinal , same as the set of all countable ordinals . <m> \omega _ 1 = \{ \alpha : 0 \le \alpha < \omega _ 1 \} = \{ \alpha : \alpha </m> is a countable ordinal <m> \} </m> . let <m> \mathcal F </m> be the set of all functions <m> f : \omega _ 1 \to \omega _ 1 </m> that are : -LRB- a -RRB- regressive i.e. <m> f ( \alpha ) < \alpha </m> for all <m> 0 < \alpha < \omega _ 1 </m> , and -LRB- b -RRB- non-decreasing -LRB- same as <m> \le </m> - order-preserving -RRB- , i.e. , if <m> 0 \le \alpha \leq \beta < \omega _ 1 </m> then <m> f ( \alpha ) \leq f ( \beta ) </m> . define a partial order <m> \sqsubseteq </m> on <m> \mathcal F </m> by <m> f \sqsubseteq g </m> if <m> f ( \alpha ) \leq g ( \alpha ) </m> for all <m> \alpha < \omega _ 1 </m> . let <m> \mathcal K </m> be the subset of <m> \mathcal F </m> , consisting of functions with a finite range . formally <m> \mathcal K = \{ f \in \mathcal F : | \{ f ( \alpha ) : \alpha < \omega _ 1 \} | < \aleph _ 0 \} </m> . question : is there a <m> \sqsubseteq </m> - order-preserving map -LRB- same as a <m> \sqsubseteq </m> - non-decreasing map -RRB- <m> \psi : \mathcal F \to \mathcal K </m> , i.e if <m> f \sqsubseteq g </m> then <m> \psi ( f ) \sqsubseteq \psi ( g ) </m> , and with the additional property that <m> \psi ( f ) \sqsupseteq f </m> for all <m> f \in \mathcal F </m> ? let me summarize some comments made at mo , clarifying certain partial answers . partial answer -LRB- a -RRB- . since every <m> f \in \mathcal F </m> is regressive and non-decreasing , it must be eventually constant and reach its maximal value <m> \mu _ f = \max \{ f ( \alpha ) : \alpha < \omega _ 1 \} </m> . one is tempted to define <m> \psi ( f ) ( \alpha ) = \mu _ f </m> for all <m> \alpha </m> . the problem is that this is not regressive : we have <m> \psi ( f ) ( \alpha ) < \alpha </m> only when <m> \alpha > \mu _ f </m> , but i insist that <m> \psi ( f ) ( \alpha ) < \alpha </m> whenever <m> 0 < \alpha < \omega _ 1 </m> . partial answer -LRB- b -RRB- . if we drop the requirement that <m> \psi </m> be a <m> \sqsubseteq </m> - non-decreasing map then the answer by @noahs below works , as well as one of my comments below , which i move here . as above let <m> \mu _ f = \max \{ f ( \alpha ) : \alpha < \omega _ 1 \} </m> and let <m> \gamma _ f = \min \{ \alpha : f ( \alpha ) = \mu _ f \} </m> . -LRB- then <m> f ( \alpha ) = \mu _ f </m> for <m> \alpha \ge \gamma _ f </m> , and <m> f ( \alpha ) < \mu _ f </m> for <m> \alpha < \gamma _ f </m> . usually <m> \mu _ f < \gamma _ f </m> unless <m> \mu _ f = 0 = \gamma _ f </m> . -RRB- let <m> \alpha _ { 0 , f } = \mu _ f </m> . if <m> \mu _ f \ge 1 </m> then let <m> \alpha _ { 1 , f } = f ( \alpha _ { 0 , f } ) < \alpha _ { 0 , f } </m> . there is a non-negative integer <m> n _ f </m> such that <m> \alpha _ { k + 1 , f } = f ( \alpha _ { k , f } ) < \alpha _ { k , f } </m> for <m> k < n _ f </m> , and <m> \alpha _ { n _ f , f } = 0 </m> . define <m> \psi ( f ) </m> as follows . if <m> \alpha > \alpha _ { 0 , f } </m> then let <m> \psi ( f ) ( \alpha ) = \alpha _ { 0 , f } = \mu _ f </m> . if <m> \alpha _ { k + 1 , f } < \alpha \le \alpha _ { k , f } </m> then let <m> \psi ( f ) ( \alpha ) = \alpha _ { k + 1 , f } </m> . -LRB- formally also <m> \psi ( f ) ( 0 ) = 0 </m> , but in general each function in <m> \mathcal F </m> being regressive must take value <m> 0 </m> at <m> 1 </m> , and being non-decreasing must take value <m> 0 </m> at <m> 0 </m> as well . -RRB- then <m> \psi ( f ) \in \mathcal K </m> and <m> \psi ( f ) \sqsupseteq f </m> . so partial answer -LRB- a -RRB- above achieves that <m> \psi ( f ) </m> has a finite range , and <m> \psi ( f ) \sqsubseteq \psi ( g ) </m> whenever <m> f \sqsubseteq g </m> , and also <m> \psi ( f ) \sqsupseteq f </m> . it almost achieves that <m> \psi ( f ) </m> is regressive , but not quite , and it follows that <m> \psi ( f ) </m> is not in <m> \mathcal K </m> unless <m> \mu _ f = 0 </m> . -LRB- one could perhaps say that <m> \psi ( f ) </m> is `` regressive on a tail '' only , which might in a different context be good enough , but the requirement in my question is that <m> \psi ( f ) ( \alpha ) < \alpha </m> whenever <m> 0 < \alpha < \omega _ 1 </m> . -RRB- on the other hand , partial answer <m> B </m> achieves that <m> \psi ( f ) \in \mathcal K </m> -LRB- in particular both that <m> \psi ( f ) </m> is regressive and has a finite range -RRB- , and <m> \psi ( f ) \sqsupseteq f </m> for all <m> f \in \mathcal F </m> , but not necessarily that <m> \psi ( f ) \sqsubseteq \psi ( g ) </m> whenever <m> f \sqsubseteq g </m> . it is not clear to me if we could achieve all conditions simultaneously . edit . following a comment , let me clarify why in partial answer <m> B </m> we need not have <m> \psi ( f ) \sqsubseteq \psi ( g ) </m> whenever <m> f \sqsubseteq g </m> . fix any ordinals <m> 0 < \beta < \delta < \nu < \omega _ 1 </m> . let <m> f ( \alpha ) = g ( \alpha ) = 0 </m> if <m> 0 \le \alpha < \nu </m> . let <m> f ( \alpha ) = \beta </m> and <m> g ( \alpha ) = \delta </m> if <m> \alpha \ge \nu </m> . clearly <m> f \sqsubseteq g </m> . then <m> \psi ( f ) ( \alpha ) = \beta </m> if <m> \alpha > \beta </m> , and <m> \psi ( f ) ( \alpha ) = 0 </m> if <m> 0 \le \alpha \le \beta </m> -LRB- where <m> \psi </m> is as in partial answer <m> B </m> -RRB- . while <m> \psi ( g ) ( \alpha ) = \delta </m> if <m> \alpha > \delta </m> , and <m> \psi ( g ) ( \alpha ) = 0 </m> if <m> 0 \le \alpha \le \delta </m> . in particular , if <m> \beta < \alpha \le \delta </m> then <m> \psi ( g ) ( \alpha ) = 0 < \beta = \psi ( f ) ( \alpha ) </m> , so <m> \psi ( f ) \not \sqsubseteq \psi ( g ) </m> . if i were to make a guess , i would say the answer is no . this question is an order-theoretic restatement of a question from general topology that a co-author and i considered : whether <m> \omega _ 1 </m> has a monotone interior-preserving open operator <m> r </m> , that is , if <m> \mathcal U </m> is any open cover of <m> \omega _ 1 </m> , with the order topology , then <m> r ( \mathcal U ) </m> is an interior-preserving open refinement that covers <m> \omega _ 1 </m> , and if <m> \mathcal U </m> refines <m> \mathcal V </m> then <m> r ( \mathcal U ) </m> refines <m> r ( \mathcal V ) </m> . as usual we would write <m> \mathcal U \preceq \mathcal V </m> if <m> \mathcal U </m> refines <m> \mathcal V </m> . in this context <m> f </m> is intended to encode an open cover <m> \mathcal U ( f ) = \{ 0 \} \cup \{ ( f ( \alpha ) , \alpha ] : \alpha < \omega _ 1 \} </m> . note that if <m> f \sqsubseteq g </m> then <m> \mathcal U ( g ) \preceq \mathcal U ( f ) </m> . thank you ! original version of this let <m> \omega _ 1 </m> be the first uncountable ordinal , same as the set of all countable ordinals . let <m> F </m> be the set of all functions <m> f </m> from <m> \omega _ 1 </m> minus singleton <m> 0 </m> into <m> \omega _ 1 </m> that are -LRB- a -RRB- regressive i.e. <m> f ( \alpha ) < \alpha </m> for <m> 0 < \alpha < \omega _ 1 </m> , and -LRB- b -RRB- order-preserving -LRB- same as non-decreasing -RRB- i.e. <m> f ( \alpha ) \leq f ( \beta ) </m> if <m> \alpha \leq \beta </m> . define a partial order on <m> F </m> by <m> f \leq g </m> if <m> f ( \alpha ) \leq g ( \alpha ) </m> for all <m> 0 < \alpha < \omega _ 1 </m> . let <m> K </m> be the subset of <m> F </m> , of functions with a finite range . question : is there an order-preserving homomorphism <m> h : F \to K </m> , i.e if <m> f \le g </m> then <m> h ( f ) \le h ( g ) </m> , and with the additional property that <m> f \le h ( f ) </m> ? -LRB- i had dropped -LRB- b -RRB- in my first post , but comments below show that it is essential . also , i did mean the functions <m> f </m> must be regressive , when i had imprecisely said decreasing , in the original statement . i added the gn tag since the question stated is an order-theoretic translation of a question from general topology : whether <m> \omega _ 1 </m> has a monotone interior-preserving open operator . -RRB- edit april 28 , 2014 : the answer by noah s below is correct but incomplete -LRB- for each <m> f \in F </m> it finds <m> h ( f ) \in K </m> with <m> f \le h ( f ) </m> but does not consider whether <m> h ( f ) \le h ( g ) </m> when <m> f \le g \in F </m> -RRB- . the question is open . thank you edit april 12 , 2015 . i reposted at mse update oct 19 , 2018 :

dear all , i know , that for general linear group <m> G L ( n , p ^ r ) </m> , the structure of sylow <m> p - </m> subgroup is the set of all unitraingular matrices , i need a reference for this theorem . thank you .
elements of the set <m> P </m> of positive hermitian <m> n n </m> matrices over complex numbers have some special properties : -LRB- i -RRB- they are closed under sum , -LRB- ii -RRB- they are closed under multiplication by positive scalars , -LRB- iii -RRB- spectrum of every matrix is positive , -LRB- all eigenvalues are nonnegative , and not all are equal to 0 -RRB- , -LRB- iv -RRB- <m> P + - P + i P + - i P = M _ n ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> . does any other subset of matrix algebra <m> M _ n ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> satisfy these properties except for <m> t P t ^ { - 1 } </m> , where <m> t </m> is an invertible element in <m> M _ n ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> ?
in finitely presented groups , the question of the existence of a projective resolution <m> P _ i </m> -LRB- with each <m> P _ i </m> finitely generated -RRB- of <m> \mathbb { Z } G </m> is equivalent to the existence of a <m> K ( G , 1 ) </m> which has finitely many cells in each dimension . polycyclic groups are finitely presented . are there polycyclic groups which are not <m> F P _ \infty </m> ? as a side question , since polycylic groups are those which can be realised as subgroups of <m> \mathrm { G L } _ n ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> , when does there exists an embedding <m> \imath </m> of <m> G </m> polycyclic in <m> \mathrm { G L } _ n ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> so that the above <m> K ( G , 1 ) </m> may be realised as a quotient of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> or some subspace of <m> \mathrm { G L } _ n ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> under the action of <m> \imath ( G ) </m> ?
let <m> N = \{ 1 , 2 , \ldots , n \} , n > 1 </m> . we wish to construct a set <m> A \subseteq N </m> with the property :
one of the most basic examples in noncommutative geometry is the so-called noncommutative torus , denoted here by <m> \mathbb { T } _ { \theta } </m> . as far as i know , there are several equivalent constructions of it :
let <m> ( U , x ) </m> be an open complex <m> n </m> - manifold -LRB- say an <m> n </m> - ball -RRB- with an action of <m> S ^ 1 </m> by holomorphic transformations that fix <m> x </m> . how to prove that there is a neighbourhood <m> U _ 1 \subset U </m> of <m> x </m> where the action is linearisable ? i.e. it is conjugated to some linear -LRB- diagonal -RRB- action of <m> S ^ 1 </m> on <m> \mathbb C ^ n </m> .
let <m> f : \mathbb { A } ^ { 2 } \rightarrow \mathbb { A } ^ { 1 } </m> be a map that sends <m> ( x , y ) </m> to <m> x y </m> . let <m> U \hookrightarrow \mathbb { A } ^ { 2 } </m> be the preimage <m> f ^ { - 1 } ( \mathbb { A } ^ { 2 } \setminus \{ 0 \} ) </m> and <m> X : = f ^ { 1 } ( 0 ) </m> . consider the shifted constant sheaf <m> \mathbb { C } _ { U } [ 2 ] </m> on <m> U </m> . let <m> \Psi ( \mathbb { C } _ { U } [ 2 ] ) </m> denote the nearby cycles functor applied to <m> \mathbb { C } _ { U } [ 2 ] </m> . it gives us a perverse sheaf on <m> X </m> . my question is : how to compute this perverse sheaf on <m> X </m> and the action of monodromy on it ? also if the action is unipotent then how to calculate the action of `` lefshetz '' <m> s l _ { 2 } </m> on <m> \operatorname { g r } ( \Psi ( \mathbb { C } _ { U } [ 2 ] ) ) </m> ? thanks !
let <m> M _ I ( \lambda ) </m> be the generalized verma module with highest weight <m> \lambda </m> , <m> L ( \lambda ) </m> be the simple highest weight module with highest weight <m> \lambda </m> . suppose <m> \mu \le \lambda \le \nu </m> , does this implies <m> \text { E x t } _ { \mathcal { O } ^ \mathfrak { p } } ( M _ I ( \mu ) , L ( \lambda ) ) </m> is a subspace of <m> \text { E x t } _ { \mathcal { O } ^ \mathfrak { p } } ( M _ I ( \mu ) , L ( \nu ) ) </m> ?
let <m> X </m> be a smooth projective threefold . let <m> I _ n ( X , \beta ) </m> be the hilbert scheme parametrizing subschemes <m> Z \subset X </m> with curve class <m> \beta \in H _ 2 ( X , \mathbb { Z } ) </m> and <m> \chi ( \mathcal { O } _ Z ) = n </m> . can one understand the second condition <m> \chi ( \mathcal { O } _ Z ) = n </m> geometrically ? i am aware that when <m> \beta = 0 </m> , <m> I _ n ( X , 0 ) = X ^ { [ n ] } </m> is the hilbert schemes of <m> n </m> points on <m> X </m> . how should one understand <m> \chi ( \mathcal { O } _ Z ) = n </m> for general <m> \beta </m> ?
we work over the field of complex numbers . -LRB- but remarks in characteristic <m> p </m> are very welcome . -RRB- let <m> S </m> be a finite set of points in <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 1 </m> containing <m> 0 </m> and <m> 1 </m> . -LSB- edit : assume <m> S </m> contains only algebraic numbers . -RSB-
the intersection of 3 quadrics in <m> P ^ 5 </m> is a k3 surface <m> S </m> . there is a natural map <m> S ^ { [ 2 ] } \to G ( 1 , 5 ) </m> well defined everywhere , because a generic k3 does n't contain any line and this family is maximal . this is moreover injective , because a line can meet <m> S </m> in at most 2 points -LRB- otherwise it is contained in each of the 3 quadrics , and hence it lays on <m> S </m> -RRB- . is it also an embedding ?
let <m> \mathcal { O } </m> be the ring of integers in an algebraic number field . define <m> R \subset \mathcal { O } </m> to be the set of all <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - linear combinations of units . since the product of two units is a unit , the set <m> R </m> is a ring . question : under what circumstances do we have <m> R = \mathcal { O } </m> ? of course , this holds for <m> \mathcal { O } = \mathbb { Z } </m> . it is also clearly false for imaginary quadratic number rings aside from the gaussian integers . but it is true for all the real quadratic number rings i have played with . maybe it holds whenever <m> \mathcal { O } </m> has infinitely many units ? this might be too optimistic ... in case the above has a wild or overly complicated answer , the following question might be easier . question : under what circumstances is <m> R </m> finite-index in <m> \mathcal { O } </m> as an abelian group ?
consider the polynomial <m> q ( x , y ) = a x y ^ 3 + a x ^ 3 y + b x ^ 2 y ^ 2 </m> , where <m> a </m> and <m> b </m> are real constants . suppose that <m> q ( z , \bar { w } ) + q ( w , \bar { z } ) \le q ( z , \bar { z } ) + q ( w , \bar { w } ) \quad \text { f o r a l l } z , w \in \mathbb { C } . </m> is it true that <m> a = 0 </m> ?
i randomly scatter <m> N </m> points on a bounded rectangular plane <m> P </m> with dimensions <m> A \times B </m> . to be more specific , for <m> N </m> iterations , i choose a real number <m> x \in [ 0 , A ] </m> and a real number <m> y \in [ 0 , B ] </m> , and place my point at the coordinates <m> ( x , y ) </m> . let <m> R </m> be the radius of some circle i place somewhere on the plane <m> P </m> that encloses no points . what is the probability distribution for the maximum permissible size of <m> R </m> ? note - i specified <m> P </m> to be a rectangular plane but , please , let it be any shape you wish if you can answer my question .
consider vector <m> \mathbf x = ( x _ 1 , x _ 2 , \cdots , x _ n ) </m> , <m> a </m> a scalar , <m> \mathbf b = ( b _ 0 , \cdots , b _ 0 ) </m> and <m> k < n </m> . i want to transform <m> \mathbf x </m> -LRB- <m> \mathbf y = a \mathbf x + \mathbf b </m> -RRB- such that if i set <m> k </m> elements of the resulting vector -LRB- <m> \mathbf y </m> -RRB- to zero , it is modified as less as possible . or equivalently , what is the best transformation of type <m> \mathbf y = a \mathbf x + \mathbf b </m> such that , projecting <m> \mathbf y </m> into <m> k </m> - sparse vectors , leads to minimum change -LRB- in <m> \ell </m> -2 norm sense -RRB- ? -LRB- also what values of <m> \mathbf y </m> are set to zero ? -RRB- edit : actually , this problem arouse from this original problem : find <m> k </m> - sparse vector <m> \mathbf x \in \mathbb R _ + ^ n </m> which its periodic auto-correlation function -LRB- pacf -RRB- has constant sidelobes i.e. <m> c _ 1 = c _ 2 = \cdots = c _ n </m> , where <m> c _ n = \sum _ m \tilde x _ { n + m } \tilde x _ m </m> . one way to numerically do this is minimizing <m> \sum _ { l = 1 } ^ { n - 1 } ( c _ l - c _ { l + 1 } ) ^ 2 </m> -LRB- without considering sparsity constraint -RRB- and finding a non-sparse <m> \mathbf x </m> , then making it <m> k </m> - sparse using the transform stated in the question -LRB- since the property of constant sidelobes is preserved under this transform -RRB- . so i 'm looking for the best transform of this kind .
let <m> M </m> be a bounded hypersurface . let <m> f \in H ^ { \frac 1 2 } ( M ) </m> and let <m> \varphi \colon M \to \mathbb { R } </m> be a lipschitz function . when <m> M = \Omega \subset \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> an open domain , we know that the multiplication <m> f \varphi \in H ^ { \frac 1 2 } ( \Omega ) </m> . to see this , we can show the seminorm <m> | f \varphi | _ { H ^ { \frac 1 2 } } </m> is bounded by adding and subtracting the same term , using triangle inequality and switching to polar coordinates . now let <m> M </m> be the boundary of a bounded lipschitz domain <m> \Omega \subset \mathbb { R } ^ { n } </m> , so <m> M </m> is a compact bounded <m> ( n - 1 ) </m> - dimensional hypersurface . how do i show that <m> f \varphi \in H ^ { \frac 1 2 } ( M ) </m> too ? i have trouble with the following term when following the same strategy as above : <m> \int _ M \int _ M \frac { | f ( x ) | ^ 2 | \varphi ( x ) - \varphi ( y ) | ^ 2 } { | x - y | ^ { n } } d \sigma \leq \int _ M | f ( x ) | ^ 2 \int _ M | x - y | ^ { 2 - n } d \sigma </m> and i have no idea how to bound the term <m> \int _ M | x - y | ^ { 2 - n } d \sigma </m> . remember that <m> d \sigma </m> is the surface measure . what assumptions do i need to get this to work ? thanks .
i know this is just <m> S ^ 2 </m> . to see it , i use the cw structure of <m> S ^ 1 </m> x <m> S ^ 1 </m> , consisting of one 0-cell , two 1-cells and a 2-cell . then since the reduced suspension is the cartesian product identifying the wedge -LRB- or smash product -RRB- , what just remains is the 0 . cell and the 2-cell ... this is very theoretical and i do n't visualize what is going on . i imagine a torus with two circular threads being pulled to a point and then ? if anyone has thought of this and is convinced by some visualization , i 'll thank his idea ...
the question is : which countable linear orders are <m> \aleph _ 0 </m> - categorical ? i have a bit of progress on this : define a discrete tuple to be a set of elements , ordered discretely , such that if <m> a </m> and <m> b </m> are in the tuple , and <m> c </m> is between <m> a </m> and <m> b </m> in the structure , then <m> c </m> is part of the tuple . then if there are only finitely many discrete tuples -LRB- which may contain beginning or ending points of the structure -RRB- , each of which has finite length , then it 's fairly clear that the structure is <m> \aleph _ 0 </m> - categorical -LRB- and finitely axiomatizable -RRB- with a back-and-forth argument . if there is a discrete tuple of infinite length , then the structure is not <m> \aleph _ 0 </m> - categorical , as there are infinitely many distinct formulas with two free variables -LRB- saying there are precisely <m> n </m> elements between <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> , for example , are all mutually exclusive and satisfied on the structure -RRB- . more generally , if there are discrete tuples of arbitarily large finite length , it 's still not <m> \aleph _ 0 </m> - categorical . i know there are models which fit neither characterization ; for example <m> \mathbb { Q } \times 2 </m> , with the dictionary ordering , has infinitely many discrete tuples , all with length 2 . by a quick back-and-forth argument this is still <m> \aleph _ 0 </m> - categorical , so the characterizations are n't inclusive enough .
the following irreducible trinomials are solvable : <m> x ^ 5 - 5 x ^ 2 - 3 = 0 </m> <m> x ^ 6 + 3 x + 3 = 0 </m> <m> x ^ 8 - 5 x - 5 = 0 </m> their galois groups are isomorphic to <m> { \rm D } _ 5 </m> , <m> { \rm S } _ 3 \wr { \rm C } _ 2 </m> and <m> ( { \rm S } _ 4 \times { \rm S } _ 4 ) \rtimes { \rm C } _ 2 </m> , respectively . question : is there an irreducible septic trinomial <m> x ^ 7 + a x ^ n + b = 0 </m> with solvable galois group , where <m> n \in \{ 1 , \dots , 6 \} </m> , <m> a , b \in \mathbb { Z } \setminus \{ 0 \} </m> ? p.s. for <m> n = 1 </m> , i did a search only for those with 1 real root and , if i did it correctly , there are none with integer <m> | a , b | < 5 0 </m> .
upon visiting prof. nurowski 's homepage -LRB- http://www.fuw.edu.pl/~nurowski/ -RRB- , at the top of the page , there is the following <m> 7 </m> - dimensional cross product : <m> e _ 1 e _ 2 = e _ 4 </m> , <m> e _ 2 e _ 3 = e _ 5 </m> , ... and so on , proceeding cyclically modulo <m> 7 </m> . my question is as follows . what is the stabilizer of this cross-product in <m> G L ( 7 , \mathbb { R } ) </m> ? is it the compact <m> G _ 2 </m> or some other real form of the <m> G _ 2 ^ { \mathbb { C } } </m> ? i thought this question could be fun to post , particularly since this cross-product is particularly easy to memorize -LRB- i think i know the answer though -RRB- .
is there any closed form expression for the following serie ? <m> \sum _ { k = 2 } ^ \infty ( - 1 ) ^ k \left ( - \frac { 1 } { 2 } \right ) ^ { \frac { k ( k + 1 ) } { 2 } } </m> or at least a proof that it is an irrational number . the context of this problem is given by the following link : https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2270730/whats-the-limit-of-sqrt2-sqrt2-sqrt2-sqrt2-sqrt2-sqrt2 in which it is proposed the problem of finding a closed form for the following nested radical : <m> R = \sqrt { 2 + \sqrt { 2 - \sqrt { 2 + \sqrt { 2 - \sqrt { 2 - \sqrt { 2 + . . . } } } } } } </m> whose signs follow the pattern : <m> 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 . . . </m> , where <m> 1 = + </m> , <m> 0 = - </m> . the expression for that radical is given by : <m> 2 \cos \left [ \frac { \pi } { 6 } \left ( 1 - 2 \sum _ { k = 2 } ^ \infty ( - 1 ) ^ k \left ( - \frac { 1 } { 2 } \right ) ^ { \frac { k ( k + 1 ) } { 2 } } \right ) \right ] </m> and thus the question of obtaining a closed form expression for that series arises . as noted in the post , it resembles a jacobi theta 's function , except that the range for <m> k </m> to sum over does n't match .
let <m> L \subset T ^ \ast S ^ n </m> be a properly embedded lagrangian submanifold homeomorphic to <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> with respect to the canonical symplectic structure on <m> T ^ \ast S ^ n </m> , and suppose <m> L </m> intersects the zero section <m> S ^ n </m> at exactly one point . is it necessarily true that <m> L </m> is hamiltonian isotopic to a cotangent fiber ?
let <m> A </m> be a finite set of real numbers . is it always the case that <m> | A A + A | \geq | A / A | </m> ? in the line above , <m> A A + A : = \{ a b + c : a , b , c \in A \} </m> , while <m> A / A : = \{ a / b : a , b \in A , b \neq 0 \} </m> is the ratio set . this is closely related to a previous question about the relative sizes of the sets <m> A A + A </m> and <m> A + A </m> . see is the set <m> A A + A </m> always at least as large as <m> A + A </m> ? .
let <m> X </m> be an <m> E _ \infty </m> - space -LRB- not necessarily grouplike -RRB- . let <m> x \in \pi _ 0 X </m> be an element ; say that <m> x </m> is strictly commutative if there is a map of <m> E _ \infty </m> - spaces <m> \mathbb { Z } _ { \geq 0 } \to X </m> that takes <m> 1 \mapsto x </m> . -LRB- the terminology is abusive , as for an element to be strictly commutative is extra data than a condition . -RRB- there is also a natural space of strictly commutative elements in <m> X </m> , given by the -LRB- derived -RRB- mapping space -LRB- in the homotopy theory of <m> E _ \infty </m> - spaces -RRB- <m> \hom ( \mathbb { Z } _ { \geq 0 } , X ) </m> . i do not know of a simple presentation of <m> \mathbb { Z } _ { \geq 0 } </m> as an <m> E _ \infty </m> - space -LRB- the free <m> E _ \infty </m> - space on one object is <m> \bigsqcup _ { n \geq 0 } B \Sigma _ n </m> -RRB- , so i am not sure how to write this space down in terms of <m> X </m> . if <m> X </m> is grouplike , so that it can be identified with a connective spectrum , then this is the mapping space in spectra <m> \hom ( H \mathbb { Z } , X ) </m> . what are examples of strictly commutative elements ? for instance , i am interested in the following example : given an <m> E _ \infty </m> - ring <m> R </m> , what is the space of strictly commutative elements in the infinite loop space <m> \Omega ^ \infty R </m> with multiplicative structure ? -LRB- equivalently , what is the space of maps <m> S ^ 0 [ \mathbb { Z } _ { \geq 0 } ] \to R </m> in <m> E _ \infty </m> - rings ? -RRB- one reason is that the <m> E _ \infty </m> - ring <m> S ^ 0 [ \mathbb { Z } _ { \geq 0 } ] </m> is easier to compute with than the free <m> E _ \infty </m> - ring on a generator in degree zero , but seems to be less nice formally , and i 'd like to know conditions under which an element in <m> \pi _ 0 R </m> can be hit by a map from the monoid algebra .
i do n't understand the smoothness condition in the following theorem , let <m> f : X \longrightarrow Y </m> be a projective morphism of <m> \underline { s m o o t h } </m> projective varieties such that <m> R f _ * \mathcal { O } _ X = \mathcal { O } _ Y </m> . then the functor <m> L f ^ * : D ^ b ( Y ) \longrightarrow D ^ b ( X ) </m> is fully faithful . the proof is easy , <m> H o m _ { D ( X ) } ( L f ^ * \mathcal { F } ^ { \bullet } , L f ^ * \mathcal { F } ^ { \bullet } ) \simeq H o m _ { D ( Y ) } ( \mathcal { F } ^ { \bullet } , R f _ * L f ^ * \mathcal { F } ^ { \bullet } ) \simeq H o m _ { D ( Y ) } ( \mathcal { F } ^ { \bullet } , \mathcal { F } ^ { \bullet } \otimes R f _ * \mathcal { O } _ X ) \simeq H o m _ { D ( Y ) } ( \mathcal { F } ^ { \bullet } , \mathcal { F } ^ { \bullet } ) . </m> as far as i know , the projection formula works for any proper morphism , so why we need both varieties to be smooth ? can we generalize it to the case which <m> X </m> is smooth and <m> Y </m> is singular ? -LRB- sasha explained why this is impossible , but what about the other case , i.e. <m> X </m> singular , and <m> Y </m> is smooth -RRB- thanks !
my question is a subquestion of this question . and a repost from this mse question . the settings is the following . let <m> X </m> be a scheme . assume that the adjunction in tag01bh of the stacks project is actually an adjoint equivalence . my goal is to proof that <m> X </m> is affine . this is a special case of the general question : can we reconstruct a scheme from its category of quasi-coherent sheafs ? i am aware of the available reconstruction theorems , but i feel that this could be done with elementary methods . feel free to critique this feeling . for starters , quasi-separatedness of <m> X </m> should be established before you can invoke gabriel-rosenberg and quasi-compactness before you can use serre 's vanishing theorem on <m> X </m> . any hints on how to go about this ? what i tried thus far is trying to use serre 's vanishing theorem . the problem : how to prove that there exist ` enough ' acyclic resolutions inside <m> Q c o h ( X ) </m> as is the case for <m> Q c o h ( \mbox { S p e c } \Gamma ( X , O _ X ) ) </m> , since <m> \widetilde { I } </m> is flasque for injective <m> \Gamma ( X , O _ X ) </m> - modules <m> I </m> .
let <m> P = \{ x \in \mathbb { R } ^ n \mid A x \leq b \} </m> be a -LRB- bounded -RRB- polyhedron for <m> A \in \mathbb { R } ^ { m \times n } </m> and <m> b \in \mathbb { R } ^ m </m> , <m> n , m > 0 </m> . moreover , let <m> M \colon \mathbb { R } ^ n \to \mathbb { R } ^ p </m> be a linear map for <m> p \leq n </m> . i 'm interested in computing a <m> \mathcal { H } </m> - representation of <m> M \cdot P = \{ C x \mid x \in P \} . </m> are there any known algorithms , besides the `` quantifier elimination for linear arithmetic '' as pointed out in 1 ?
theorem 2.9 on page 49 of atiyah 's geometry of yang-mills fields states that there is a natural correspondence between <m> U ( n ) </m> - instantons on <m> S ^ 4 </m> and holomorphic vector bundles of rank <m> n </m> over <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 3 </m> with a positive real form -LRB- essentially a hermitian inner product compatible with the real structure on <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 3 </m> -RRB- . a key result used to associate a holomorphic bundle to an instanton is theorem 1.2 on page 46 which asserts that on an hermitian vector bundle <m> E </m> equipped with a metric connection <m> \nabla </m> over a complex manifold there is a unique holomorphic structure on e such that <m> \nabla </m> is the chern connection of <m> E </m> . this theorem is used on the lifted bundle with lifted metric and connection -LRB- the lift is given by pullback with the twistor fibration map -RRB- . atiyah says that theorem 2.9 `` can easily be generalized to the orthogonal and symplectic case '' . i ca n't see how to go from instanton to holomorphic bundle in the orthogonal case if theorem 1.2 does n't apply -LRB- the lifted bundle will have a quadratic form , not a hermitian form -RRB- . thoughts ?
i have two finite sets of events <m> \{ x _ 1 , . . . , x _ N \} </m> and <m> \{ y _ 1 , . . . , y _ N \} </m> that are sampled from the pdfs <m> f ( x ) </m> and <m> g ( x ) </m> , respectively , where <m> x \in [ - 1 , + 1 ] </m> . i want to estimate the legendre expansion of <m> r ( x ) = f ( x ) / g ( x ) </m> using these events . what is the best method ? -LRB- note that <m> g ( x ) \neq 0 </m> over <m> [ - 1 , 1 ] </m> -RRB-
let <m> N \ge 1 </m> and let <m> \ell </m> and <m> p </m> be primes not dividing <m> N </m> . the classical ihara lemma says that if <m> Y _ 1 ( N , \ell ) </m> is the modular curve attached to the subgroup <m> \Gamma _ 1 ( N ) \cap \Gamma _ 0 ( \ell ) </m> , and <m> \operatorname { P r } _ 1 </m> and <m> \operatorname { P r } _ 2 </m> are the two pushforward maps <m> H ^ 1 ( Y _ 1 ( N , \ell ) , \mathbf { Z } _ p ) \to H ^ 1 ( Y _ 1 ( N ) , \mathbf { Z } _ p ) </m> corresponding to <m> z \mapsto z </m> and <m> z \mapsto \ell z </m> on the upper half-plane , then the map <m> \operatorname { P r } _ 1 \oplus \operatorname { P r } _ 2 </m> is surjective onto <m> H ^ 1 ( Y _ 1 ( N ) , \mathbf { Z } _ p ) ^ { \oplus 2 } </m> , after localising at a non-eisenstein maximal ideal of the hecke algebra . i 'm interested in whether this continues to hold if we allow more general coefficient modules <m> \operatorname { S y m } ^ k \mathbf { Z } _ p ^ 2 </m> -LRB- regarded as a representation of <m> \Gamma _ 1 ( N ) </m> , and thus as a sheaf on <m> Y _ 1 ( N ) </m> , in the usual way -RRB- . i know several references that treat this case , but they all assume <m> \ell \ne p </m> , while the original ihara lemma still works for <m> \ell = p </m> . is the lemma still true for <m> \ell = p </m> in this more general setting ?
the riemann hypothesis is known to be equivalent to the statement that <m> \zeta ' </m> -LRB- the derivative of the riemann zeta function -RRB- has no zeros in the region <m> 0 < \Re ( s ) < 1 / 2 </m> . by the functional equation , this seems to be equivalent to saying that the zeros of <m> \zeta ' </m> are actually on the critical line <m> \Re ( s ) = 1 / 2 </m> . also , it is known that the truth of the rh implies that all the zeros of the integer derivatives of <m> \xi ( s ) </m> - the riemann xi function , are also on the critical line . so my question is : are the zeros of <m> \zeta ' </m> exactly the zeros of <m> \zeta </m> , which the above seems to suggest ?
let <m> u </m> be a solution of the heat equation <m> u _ t - u _ { x x } = 0 , \quad t > 0 , x \in \mathbb { R } </m> with initial data <m> u ( 0 , \cdot ) = u _ 0 </m> . fix <m> \alpha > 0 </m> . how can i estimate -LRB- without using explicitly the heat kernel -RRB- <m> \sup _ { t > 0 } \int _ { \mathbb { R } } t ^ \alpha | u _ x | ^ 2 \ d x , </m> in terms of the initial data ? could you point out a reference where such an estimate is obtained ? is it fair to call what we obtain a decay estimate ?
let <m> M V _ F </m> be the <m> \mathbf { A } ^ 1 </m> - homotopy category over the field <m> F </m> . let <m> H </m> be the homotopy category of spaces , and let <m> H _ { / S ^ 1 } </m> be the homotopy category of spaces over the circle . when <m> F = \mathbf { C } </m> , there 's a betti realization functor <m> M V _ { \mathbf { C } } \to H </m> . is there a similar realization functor <m> M V _ { \mathbf { C } ( ( t ) ) } \to H _ { / S ^ 1 } </m> ? etale homotopy theory gives a realization in profinite spaces over a profinite circle . i 'm looking for a refinement of that . if a variety over <m> \mathbf { C } ( ( t ) ) </m> is defined using only convergent power series , i think it is clear which bundle over <m> S ^ 1 </m> i want . if the variety is defined using finitely many nonconvergent power series , i can imagine some tricks for defining the bundle over s ^ 1 that i want , even up to homeomorphism . but if a map between varieties has some nonconvergent power series in it , i bet there is no way to write down a map between those bundles , not functorially . i hope that it can be done up to homotopy .
let <m> G </m> be a connected , reductive group , split over a local field <m> F </m> . let <m> B = T U </m> be a borel subgroup defined over <m> F </m> with maximal torus <m> T </m> and unipotent radical <m> U </m> . let <m> P </m> be a parabolic subgroup of <m> G </m> containing <m> F </m> , and let <m> N = R _ u ( P ) </m> . for <m> \alpha \in \Phi ( T , U ) </m> , let <m> U _ { \alpha } </m> be the root subgroup corresponding to <m> \alpha </m> . fix an <m> F </m> - isomorphism <m> x _ { \alpha } : \mathbb { A } ^ 1 \rightarrow U _ { \alpha } </m> such that <m> t x _ { \alpha } ( a ) t ^ { - 1 } = x _ { \alpha } ( \alpha ( t ) a ) </m> for all <m> t \in T , a \in \mathbb { A } ^ 1 </m> . each <m> x _ { \alpha } </m> allows us to transfer a haar measure on <m> F </m> to one on <m> U _ { \alpha } </m> . since the product map -LRB- in any order -RRB- <m> \prod \limits _ { \alpha \in \Phi ( T , N ) } U _ { \alpha } ( F ) \rightarrow N ( F ) </m> is a homeomorphism , one can transfer the radon product measure on <m> \prod \limits U _ { \alpha } ( F ) </m> to a borel measure <m> \mu </m> on <m> N ( F ) </m> . then <m> \mu </m> is a haar measure on <m> N ( F ) </m> . one can verify this directly for parabolic subgroups of split classical groups , but how can one argue that <m> \mu </m> is a haar measure for arbitrary split groups ? more generally in the non-split case , is it possible to define a haar measure on <m> N ( F ) </m> using root subgroups for relative roots ?
i know that for any fuchsian group <m> \Gamma </m> , there is a spectral gap , which leads to <m> \left | \int _ 0 ^ 1 F ( x + i y ) \, d x - \int _ { \Gamma \backslash \mathbb { H } } F \, \frac { d x \, d y } { y ^ 2 } \right | < C _ F y ^ \delta </m> this is related to the equidistribution of the horocycle flow in the hyperblic plane . possibly i need to say that <m> F </m> is smooth -LRB- <m> C ^ \infty </m> -RRB- or <m> C ^ 1 </m> or holomorphic or a cusp form . if i knew more about the theory of modular forms or dynamical systems i could say which one . in the literature the theorems often say , `` for reasonable <m> F </m> ... '' for a particular <m> \Gamma </m> do we know which that <m> \delta </m> should be ? or is it even true that we can choose the same <m> \delta </m> for a wide range of <m> \Gamma </m> ? the two cases i have in mind are :
most standard summaries of the literature on irrationality measure simply say , e.g. , that <m> \left | \pi - \frac { p } { q } \right | > \frac { 1 } { q ^ { 7 . 6 0 6 3 } } </m> for all sufficiently large <m> q </m> , without giving any indication of how large qualifies as `` sufficiently large . '' it would occasionally be useful -LRB- for example , for my answer here -RRB- to be able to come up with explicit bounds on the size of <m> q </m> . i do n't have access to salikhov 's paper where the exponent <m> 7 . 6 0 6 3 </m> is obtained , but hata 's paper which obtained an exponent of <m> 8 . 0 1 6 1 </m> is online here . looking through it , the proof seems to be effective -LRB- all the bounds he 's using appear to be defined explicitly -RRB- , but it is definitely not written to be clear about what those bounds are . has anyone extracted explicit bounds on the size of the denominator from any irrationality measure calculation for <m> \pi </m> more recent than mahler 's proof -LRB- referenced in the hata paper -RRB- that <m> \left | \pi - \frac { p } { q } \right | > \frac { 1 } { q ^ { 4 2 } } </m> unrestrictedly ?
is there some relationship between the <m> p </m> - adic regulators of isogenous curves over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> ? i 've done some computations and their ratio seems to be related -LRB- equivalent in all calculations so far -RRB- to the ratio of their modular degree . there does n't seem to be too much literature on this . or perhaps it 's a just a corollary of some known theorem and thus not very interesting . if i 'm looking at the wrong place , could somebody please advise on this ?
are infinitely many primes <m> P _ { 2 n - 1 } </m> expressible as <m> 3 k - 1 </m> ? the primes <m> P _ { 2 n - 1 } </m> are every other prime beginning with <m> 2 </m> : <m> 2 , 5 , 1 1 , 1 7 , 2 3 , 3 1 , \cdots </m> . the first few are of the form <m> 3 k - 1 </m> , but <m> 3 1 </m> is not .
following aubin 's book `` some nonlinear problems in riemannian geometry '' , we use the notation <m> | \nabla ^ r \psi | ^ 2 = \nabla _ { \alpha _ 1 } \cdots \nabla _ { \alpha _ r } \psi \nabla ^ { \alpha _ 1 } \cdots \nabla ^ { \alpha _ r } \psi </m> where <m> \nabla _ \alpha </m> is the covariant derivative and <m> \nabla ^ \alpha : = g ^ { \alpha \beta } \nabla _ \beta </m> . the statement is the first part of the proof of proposition 2.11 on page 36 . for simplicity , let me quote the statement for <m> r = 1 </m> of the proposition :
assume that all edges of a complete graph <m> K _ n </m> are colored in <m> k </m> colors . we want to choose <m> m </m> colors so that the graph formed by edges of chosen colors is connected . it is always possible if <m> m \geq k / 2 </m> -LRB- partition all colors onto two groups of at most <m> m </m> colors , it is impossible that both groups form disconnected graph -RRB- . if <m> k = 2 m + 1 </m> this is already not always possible for large enough <m> n </m> . namely , if <m> n = \binom { 2 m + 1 } { m } </m> it may appear that for any <m> m </m> - subset <m> I </m> of colors there exists a vertex <m> v _ I </m> such that no edge ended in <m> v </m> has color from <m> I </m> . the specific question is do we really need such a large <m> n </m> ? say , if <m> n </m> grows in <m> m </m> subexponentially , may we choose <m> m </m> colors which form a connected subgraph ?
let <m> X </m> be a complex manifold . if <m> D </m> is a divisor on <m> X </m> , then <m> \mathcal { O } ( D ) </m> denotes the -LRB- up to isomorphic -RRB- line bundle <m> \mathcal { L } </m> with a meromorphic section <m> m </m> whose divisor <m> ( m ) = D </m> . but if <m> \mathcal { L } </m> is a line bundle on <m> X </m> , there is also the notation <m> \mathcal { O } ( \mathcal { L } ) </m> . can anyone tell me what does it mean ? thank you very much .
let <m> k </m> be an algebraically closed field , it is well known that <m> \mathbb P ^ 1 </m> is simply connected , but how about smooth projective surfaces <m> X </m> with a smooth morphism to <m> \Bbb P ^ 1 </m> ? except the case <m> X </m> is a product of curves or a projective bundle like hirzebruch surfaces , could we classify all such <m> X \rightarrow \Bbb P ^ 1 </m> ? what about higher dimensional cases ? motivation : shafarevich conjecture over function field .
choose an embedding <m> \overline { \mathbf { Q } } \rightarrow \mathbf { C } </m> from an algebraic closure of the field of rationals to the field of complex numbers . question 1 : is it true that <m> \mathbf { C } </m> is isomorphic to <m> \overline { \mathbf { Q } } ( T _ { i \in I } ) </m> a pure transcendental extension of degree the cardinality of some uncountable set <m> I </m> ? question 2 is there a concrete description of the -LRB- profinite ? -RRB- group <m> \mathrm { A u t } _ { \overline { \mathbf { Q } } } ( \mathbf { C } ) </m> ?
let a planar region <m> R </m> be defined by the vertical range bounded by a polynomial <m> f ( x ) \pm c </m> with <m> c > 0 </m> a constant , and with <m> x </m> varying between the smallest and largest roots of <m> f ( x ) </m> . for example , <m>  </m> within <m> x \in [ 1 , 4 ] </m> . now i would like to connect the smallest and largest roots of <m> f ( x ) </m> with a polygonal line of fewest links that remains in <m> R </m> . in the example , between <m> ( 1 , 0 ) </m> to <m> ( 4 , 0 ) </m> :
recall that given two strict ω-categories <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> , their lax gray tensor product <m> A \otimes B </m> is sent to the verity-gray tensor product of their associated complicial sets <m> N _ { \operatorname { S t r a t } } ( A ) \otimes N _ { \operatorname { S t r a t } } ( B ) </m> by the stratified nerve of verity . further , given any strict ω-category <m> A </m> , the underlying simplicial set of the complicial set <m> N _ { \operatorname { S t r a t } } ( A ) </m> is exactly <m> N _ \omega ( A ) </m> , where <m> N _ \omega = N _ { \mathcal { O } } </m> is the nerve functor associated with the cosimplicial object <m> \mathcal { O } : \Delta \to \omega \operatorname { - c a t } </m> where <m> \mathcal { O } [ n ] </m> is <m> n </m> th oriental as defined by street . consider the following case : if we take the lax gray tensor product of two freestanding 1-cells <m> [ 1 ] \otimes [ 1 ] </m> and apply the stratified nerve , we obtain a verity-gray tensor product <m> N _ { \operatorname { S t r a t } } ( [ 1 ] ) \otimes N _ { \operatorname { S t r a t } } ( [ 1 ] ) </m> . by the definition of this tensor product , its underlying simplicial set is given simply as <m> [ 1 ] \times [ 1 ] </m> , and therefore , we see that the street nerve <m> N _ \omega ( [ 1 ] \otimes [ 1 ] ) = [ 1 ] \times [ 1 ] </m> . if we actually take a moment to draw out the strict ω-category <m> [ 1 ] \otimes [ 1 ] </m> , we see that it can be visualized as : • ==== • -- > • | \ \ | | \ \ | | \ = > \ | | \ \ | v v vv • -- > • ==== •
allow me to give context to the question , which appears in the box at the bottom . a very general hope from the theory of dirichlet series is to try to extract information about the coefficients of a dirichlet series like <m> D ( s ) = \sum _ { n \geq 1 } \frac { a ( n ) } { n ^ s } . </m> frequently , we 're interested in partial sums like <m> A _ 0 ( X ) : = \sum _ { n \leq X } a ( n ) , </m> which we might get at by performing an inverse mellin transform like <m> A _ 0 ( X ) = \frac { 1 } { 2 \pi i } \int _ { ( \sigma ) } D ( s ) X ^ s \frac { d s } { s } </m> for <m> \sigma </m> in the realm of absolute convergence of the dirichlet series . one might proceed by shifting the line of integration left , picking up residues , etc. but in practice this can be hard , since convergence issues can rear their angry heads . sometimes , we can instead get information about <m> A _ d ( X ) : = \frac { 1 } { d ! X ^ d } \sum _ { n \leq X } a ( n ) ( X - n ) ^ d </m> through the transform <m> A _ d ( X ) = \frac { 1 } { 2 \pi i } \int _ { ( \sigma ) } D ( s ) X ^ s \frac { d s } { s ( s + 1 ) \cdots ( s + d ) } , </m> which might converge better .
the factorial function is primitive recursive , and therefore definable by a <m> \Sigma _ 1 </m> formula . is it also definable by a <m> \Delta _ 0 </m> formula -LRB- i.e. bounded quantifiers -RRB- ? if not , why ?
let <m> M </m> be a submanifold in an euclidean space <m> \mathbb { R } ^ k </m> , and <m> \nu ( M ) </m> the normal bundle to <m> M </m> , let us denote <m> \phi </m> the restriction to <m> \nu ( M ) </m> of the exponential map for <m> \mathbb { R } ^ k </m> . a critical value for <m> \phi </m> could be called focal point of <m> M </m> . by sard 's theorem , the set of critical values for <m> \phi </m> is of measure zero . consequently the set of regular values for <m> \phi </m> is dense in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ k </m> . my question is : there are conditions on <m> M </m> under which the set of critical values for <m> \phi </m> is closed in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ k </m> ? edit -LRB- after the answer of sergei ivanov -RRB- my starting motivation was to know if the set of focal points of any closed submanifold of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ k </m> is itself closed . so in particular , specifying the original question , is it possible to find examples of closed submanifolds whose focal set is not closed ?
i had asked something very similar before on math.se -LRB- deleted now -RRB- but unfortunately it had n't received a lot of attention . i decided to re-ask here . let <m> S </m> be a fixed scheme . is the following true ?
let <m> X </m> be a rational surface , say <m> X </m> is del pezzo surface . let <m> D </m> be <m> ( - 1 ) </m> - class divisor , i.e : <m> D ^ 2 = - 1 </m> and <m> D ^ 2 + D . K _ X = - 2 </m> . it is easy to show that on del pezzo surface any <m> ( - 1 ) </m> - class divisor is irreducible <m> ( - 1 ) </m> - rational curve . we know the intersection graph of <m> ( - 1 ) </m> - curve on <m> X </m> , say if <m> K _ X ^ 2 = 6 </m> , it is a <m> 6 </m> - gon , if <m> K _ X ^ 2 = 5 </m> , it is perterson graph and so on . it is easy to show that the graph for any rational surface , say degree <m> \geq 1 </m> only depends on <m> d e g ( X ) </m> , the differences are the irreducibility of vertices . now , assume that <m> X </m> is smooth surface of general type with <m> p _ g = q = 0 </m> , -LRB- maybe minimal or not -RRB- with <m> K _ X ^ 2 > 0 </m> , is there any interesting example of surface such that the intersection graph of <m> ( - 1 ) </m> - class can be drawn ? or a simpler question , how many <m> ( - 1 ) </m> - classes can the surface have ? are there finitely many ?
i have asked this question in math.stackexchange without any answer , so i have decided to post it here too . recently i was playing around with the sequence <m> \frac { 1 } { n \sin ( n ) } , \ n \in \mathbb { N } . </m> after some computations , i was led to the following question : let <m> p _ n , q _ n </m> be two sequences of natural numbers such that <m> \left | \frac { p _ n } { q _ n } - \frac { \pi } { 2 } \right | < \frac { 1 } { q _ n ^ 2 } . </m>
let <m> n \in \mathbb N </m> . let <m> k </m> be a commutative ring in which <m> 1 , 2 , 3 , \ldots </m> are invertible . let <m> \Omega </m> denote the <m> k </m> - algebra of polynomial differential operators on <m> n </m> variables <m> x _ 1 </m> , <m> x _ 2 </m> , ... , <m> x _ n </m> over <m> k </m> . -LRB- the multiplication in this algebra is the composition of differential operators . -RRB- let <m> M : k \left [ x _ 1 , x _ 2 , . . . , x _ n \right ] \otimes k \left [ \dfrac { \partial } { \partial x _ 1 } , \dfrac { \partial } { \partial x _ 2 } , . . . , \dfrac { \partial } { \partial x _ n } \right ] \to \Omega </m> be the <m> k </m> - linear map which sends every <m> P \otimes Q </m> to <m> P \cdot Q </m> . clearly , <m> M </m> is an isomorphism of <m> k </m> - modules , but not of <m> k </m> - algebras -LRB- unless <m> k = 0 </m> or <m> n \leq 1 </m> -RRB- . this allows us to define a commutative multiplication <m> \boxdot </m> on <m> \Omega </m> by letting <m> A \boxdot B = M \left ( M ^ { - 1 } \left ( A \right ) \cdot M ^ { - 1 } \left ( B \right ) \right ) </m> for all <m> A \in \Omega </m> and <m> B \in \Omega </m> . this <m> \boxdot </m> is called the normal -LRB- ly ? -RRB- ordered product on <m> \Omega </m> . -LRB- when <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> are atomic terms , one often writes <m> : A B : </m> for <m> A \boxdot B </m> , but when <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> are composite terms , <m> : A B : </m> can mean something slightly different . -RRB- the <m> k </m> - linear map <m> \ell : \mathfrak { g l } _ { n } \to \Omega </m> which sends every elementary matrix <m> E _ { i , j } </m> to <m> x _ i \dfrac { \partial } { \partial x _ j } </m> is a lie algebra homomorphism . thus , it gives rise to a <m> k </m> - algebra homomorphism <m> L : U \left ( \mathfrak { g l } _ { n } \right ) \to \Omega </m> . this homomorphism <m> L </m> is generally not injective -LRB- i guess it 's like a noncommutative segre embedding : it sends <m> E _ { i , j } E _ { k , l } </m> to the same differential operator as <m> E _ { i , l } E _ { j , k } </m> if <m> i </m> , <m> j </m> , <m> k </m> , <m> l </m> are pairwise distinct -RRB- . hence the following question : is there a -LRB- commutative ? -RRB- multiplication <m> \boxdot </m> on <m> U \left ( \mathfrak { g l } _ { n } \right ) </m> such that any <m> A \in U \left ( \mathfrak { g l } _ { n } \right ) </m> and <m> B \in U \left ( \mathfrak { g l } _ { n } \right ) </m> satisfy <m> L \left ( A \right ) \boxdot L \left ( B \right ) = L \left ( A \boxdot B \right ) </m> ? note that -LRB- by a theorem of sylvester from 1867 , in p92 from the second tome of his collected works , but not the one i asked about in that thread -RRB- the image of <m> L </m> is closed under <m> \boxdot </m> , and actually is the <m> k </m> - subalgebra of <m> \Omega </m> generated by the image of <m> \ell </m> under <m> \boxdot </m> - multiplication . this speaks in favor of the existence of a <m> \boxdot </m> on <m> U \left ( \mathfrak { g l } _ { n } \right ) </m> -LRB- but is not a proof yet , since <m> L </m> is not injective -RRB- .
what is the group of outer automorphisms of <m> S L _ n ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> . i wanted to understand semidirect products of the form <m> S L _ n ( \mathbb { Z } ) \rtimes _ \varphi \mathbb { Z } </m> and its isomorphism type depends only on <m> [ \varphi ] \in O u t ( S L _ n ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> . there is always the conjugate inverse , which is clearly not an inner automorphism , as it does n't preserve the minimal polynomial of the matrix -LRB- at least for <m> n \ge 3 </m> -RRB- . are there any other outer automorphisms ?
let <m> X </m> be an irreducible hypersurface defined by a polynomial <m> f </m> of degree <m> 5 </m> in <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 3 </m> . let the homogeneous co-ordinates is given by <m> [ x , y , z , w ] </m> and let <m> H </m> be a hyperplane given by <m> w = 0 </m> . assume that the intersection <m> X \cap H </m> , a curve of degree <m> 5 </m> in the plane <m> H </m> , is given by an equation of the form <m> h g ^ 2 = 0 </m> , where <m> h </m> is a linear form and <m> g </m> is of degree <m> 2 </m> . further assume that <m> X </m> is singular along the plane curve <m> g = 0 </m> . in this situation one can write <m> f </m> as <m> f = h g ^ 2 + w g f _ 2 + w ^ 2 f _ 3 </m> , where <m> f _ 2 </m> is a polynomial of degree <m> 2 </m> in <m> x , y , z </m> . my question is the following : can <m> X </m> have isolated singularities ? if yes then is it possible to give an upper bound on the number of isolated singularity ? thanks in advance .
suppose you have a deck of <m> n </m> cards ; e.g. , <m> n { = } 1 2 </m> : <m> ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 1 0 , 1 1 , 1 2 ) \; . </m> cut the deck into <m> k </m> equal-sized pieces , where <m> k | n </m> ; e.g. , for <m> k { = } 4 </m> , the <m> 1 2 </m> cards are partitioned into <m> 4 </m> piles , each of <m> m = n / k = 3 </m> cards : <m> \left ( \begin {array} { c c c } 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 & 9 \\ 1 0 & 1 1 & 1 2 \\ \end {array} \right ) \; . </m> now perfectly shuffle them by selecting the top card from stack <m> 1 </m> , the top card from stack <m> 2 </m> , and so on , walking down the columns of the matrix above , resulting in this shuffled deck of cards : <m> ( 1 , 4 , 7 , 1 0 , 2 , 5 , 8 , 1 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 1 2 ) \; . </m> continue in this manner until the deck of cards returns to its initial sorting : <m> \left ( \begin {array} { c c c c c c c c c c c c } 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 1 0 & 1 1 & 1 2 \\ 1 & 4 & 7 & 1 0 & 2 & 5 & 8 & 1 1 & 3 & 6 & 9 & 1 2 \\ 1 & 1 0 & 8 & 6 & 4 & 2 & 1 1 & 9 & 7 & 5 & 3 & 1 2 \\ 1 & 6 & 1 1 & 5 & 1 0 & 4 & 9 & 3 & 8 & 2 & 7 & 1 2 \\ 1 & 5 & 9 & 2 & 6 & 1 0 & 3 & 7 & 1 1 & 4 & 8 & 1 2 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 1 0 & 1 1 & 1 2 \\ \end {array} \right ) \; . </m> here , for <m> n { = } 1 2 </m> cards partitioned into <m> k { = } 4 </m> parts , it requires <m> s { = } 5 </m> perfect shuffles to cycle . let us say that <m> f ( n , k ) = s </m> , i.e. , <m> f ( 1 2 , 4 ) = 5 </m> . similarly i can calculate that <m> f ( 8 , 2 ) = 3 , \; f ( 1 8 , 3 ) = 1 6 , \; f ( 3 3 , 3 ) = 8 , \; f ( 5 2 , 2 ) = 8 , </m> etc. the last represents a perfect `` outer-shuffle '' of a standard <m> 5 2 </m> - card deck , which is known to take <m> 8 </m> shuffles to cycle . it seems likely this function is known to combinatorialists :
let <m> N = q ^ k n ^ 2 </m> be an odd perfect number with euler prime <m> q </m> . we want to show that the biconditional <m> k = 1 \iff q = 5 </m> holds . it suffices to prove one direction , as the implication <m> q = 5 \implies k = 1 </m> was proved by iannucci -LRB- lemma 12 , page 873 -RRB- . per a comment from pace : `` jose , you are misinterpreting the result from iannucci . his number <m> N </m> is restricted to be an odd perfect number which additionally has all but at most two of its prime divisors less than <m> 1 0 0 </m> . he goes on to prove that there are no such numbers , but along the way , in the lemma you cite , he shows that such numbers have restricted form . '' to this end , we show first that <m> k = 1 \implies I ( n ^ 2 ) \leq 2 - \frac { 5 } { 3 q } . </m> the proof is easy . we refer the reader to this preprint . next , we observe that <m> I ( n ^ 2 ) = 2 - \frac { 5 } { 3 q } </m> implies that <m> k = 1 \land q = 5 , </m> -LRB- the assertion that follows only holds when <m> k = 1 </m> . -RRB- while <m> I ( n ^ 2 ) < 2 - \frac { 5 } { 3 q } </m> implies <m> q > 5 </m> . in particular , we have <m> I ( n ^ 2 ) \leq 2 - \frac { 5 } { 3 q } \implies \bigg ( \left ( k = 1 \right ) \lor \left ( q > 5 \right ) \bigg ) . </m> but we know that <m> \bigg ( \left ( k = 1 \right ) \lor \left ( q > 5 \right ) \bigg ) \iff \bigg ( q = 5 \implies k = 1 \bigg ) . </m> consequently , we have the chain of implications <m> q = 5 \implies k = 1 \implies q = 5 \implies k = 1 , </m> and we are done . now here is my question :
first of all , i am no number theorist , so this question may be a little dummy . the two squares theorem imply that <m> m = x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 </m> for some -LRB- possible zero -RRB- integer numbers <m> x , y </m> iff <m> m </m> factors as <m> m = a b ^ 2 </m> , where <m> a </m> has no prime factor <m> \equiv 3 \mod 4 </m> -LRB- see , eg. , these notes -RRB- the following question seems natural to me : is there such a simple characterization for numbers expressed as <m> m = x ^ n + y ^ n </m> for <m> n > 2 </m> ? since this seems related to fermat 's last theorem , maybe there is only partial -LRB- necessary or sufficient -RRB- conditions ? i am also interested in possible generalizations -LRB- characterizations of numbers that may be expressed as <m> m = x _ 1 ^ n + \ldots + x _ k ^ n </m> -RRB- . what is proven/conjectured about this and is there any good reference with these statements ?
referring to a question i posted on ms , i post it here , as i did n't get an answer : by analogy with the jacobi -- anger expansion , one expects that <m> e ^ { i z \cot ( x ) } </m> has a fourier expansion of the form : <m> e ^ { i z \cot ( \theta ) } = \sum _ { n = - \infty } ^ { \infty } \Lambda _ { n } ( z ) e ^ { i n \theta } </m> <m> \Lambda _ { n } ( z ) </m> is given by : <m> \Lambda _ { n } ( z ) = \frac { 1 } { \pi } \int _ { - \pi / 2 } ^ { \pi / 2 } e ^ { i z \cot ( \theta ) - i n \theta } d \theta </m> a simple calculation yields : <m> \Lambda _ { n } ( z ) = \frac { 2 } { n \pi } \sin \left ( \frac { \pi n } { 2 } \right ) \sum _ { m = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { z ^ { m } } { m ! } \text { F } _ { 1 } \left ( - \frac { n } { 2 } ; - m , m ; 1 - \frac { n } { 2 } ; 1 , - 1 \right ) </m> where <m> \text { F } _ { 1 } ( \alpha ; \beta , \beta ^ { ' } ; \gamma ; x , y ) </m> is the appell hypergeometric function . now , i have two questions : 1-for a purely imaginary <m> z </m> , <m> \; \; </m> <m> e ^ { i z \cot ( \theta ) } </m> has essential singularities at <m> \theta = \pm n \pi </m> . how is that reflected in the fourier expansion ? 2-can we express the infinite sum in terms of other special functions ?
consider the block matrix given by <m> \textbf { D } = \left [ \begin {array} { c c c } \left [ \begin {array} { c c c } D & \ldots & D \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ D & \ldots & D \\ \end {array} \right ] & \textbf { X } & \textbf { X } \\ \textbf { X } & \left [ \begin {array} { c c c } D & \ldots & D \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ D & \ldots & D \\ \end {array} \right ] & \textbf { X } \\ \textbf { X } & \textbf { X } & \left [ \begin {array} { c c c } D & \ldots & D \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ D & \ldots & D \\ \end {array} \right ] \\ \end {array} \right ] </m> where each <m> \textbf { X } </m> represents a dense matrix -LRB- but possible different from each other -RRB- in <m> \mathbb { C } ^ { n r \times n r } </m> . each matrix in the form <m>  </m> is composed by <m> r \times r </m> of these matrices <m> D </m> , which are diagonal matrices -LRB- but possible different from each other -RRB- in <m> \mathbb { C } ^ { n \times n } </m> . so each of its <m> r ^ 2 </m> entries is a diagonal matrix <m> D \in \mathbb { C } ^ { n \times n } </m> . this matrix has a sparse pattern and is supposed to be invertible . what i 'm trying to do is to obtain some upper bound for the norm of its inverse . concretely , i want an upper bound for <m> \| \textbf { D } ^ { - 1 } \| </m> where the norm can be the spectral norm or the frobenius norm . i am looking for some bound in terms of these blocks , in a way it take advantage of its sparsity . i already looked through several papers and searched on the internet , but could n't find anything helpful . all my ideas also did n't work , so my last hope is that someone here may have a good idea . this looks to be a very specific problem , and since i 'm not so familiar with results about sparse matrices , the best option is to share with you in the hope someone knows something about it . thank you !
please excuse me if this question turns out to be incredibly silly for one reason or another . are there tensor/hypermatrix analogues of <m> G L ( n , \mathbb { C } ) </m> that are interesting ? what i 'm mainly thinking of here is the following : characters of finite abelian groups are homomorphisms to <m> \mathbb { C } ^ { \times } </m> which are <m> 0 </m> - dimensional arrays , but for nonabelian groups one can get more representations by introducing homomorphisms to <m> G L ( n , \mathbb { C } ) </m> which are second order tensors . is there an analogue of <m> G L ( n , \mathbb { C } ) </m> for higher order tensors and a corresponding analogue of `` representation theory of finite groups '' for such objects as well ? and if not , is there some simple reason why there is n't - such as maybe that such things might all reduce to homomorphisms to <m> G L ( n , \mathbb { C } ) </m> after all ? i understand that there are things like hyperdeterminants of hypermatrices . are there also things that can act like the trace to give analogues of characters for these things ? basically , very generally , i 'm just wondering if one can get more things from finite groups by introducing tensors/hypermatrices that one can not get from homomorphisms to <m> G L ( n , \mathbb { C } ) </m> . -LRB- i suppose this ca n't work if any groups one can get from tensors/hypermatrices are all related to <m> G L ( n , \mathbb { C } ) </m> in an obvious way and if any analogues of `` trace '' on these tensors are also related to matrix traces in an obvious way . -RRB- i 'm currently aware of http://galton.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/work/sjsu.pdf and http://arxiv.org/ps_cache/arxiv/pdf/1109/1109.3830v1.pdf . thanks .
i asked this in math.stackexchange , but it disappeared from the `` main list '' almost immediately , so i hope it will be appropriate as a separate question in mo. for a given function <m> f \in C ( G ) </m> on a compact group <m> G </m> its fourier transform is defined as the family of operators <m> \widehat { f } _ \sigma = \int _ G f ( t ) \cdot \sigma ( t ^ { - 1 } ) \ \text { d } \ t , \quad \widehat { f } _ \sigma : X _ \sigma \to X _ \sigma </m> where <m> \sigma : G \to B ( X _ \sigma ) </m> runs over the dual object <m> \widehat { G } </m> and <m> \int . . . \text { d } \ t </m> means the integral with respect to the normed haar measure -LRB- i.e. <m> \int 1 \ \text { d } \ t = 1 </m> -RRB- . it is known that in the space <m> L _ 2 ( G ) </m> the following equality holds : <m> f ( t ) = \sum _ { \sigma \in \widehat { G } } \dim X _ \sigma \cdot \text { t r } \Big ( \widehat { f } _ \sigma \circ \sigma ( t ) \Big ) , \quad t \in G . </m> i wonder if this can be interpreted as an equality in <m> C ( G ) </m> in some specific sense -LRB- or as a pointwise equality -RRB- ? as an example , in the case <m> G = \mathbb { T } </m> the fejér theorem states that the arithmetical means of the partial sums of the series converge to <m> f </m> in <m> C ( G ) </m> -LRB- and hence pointwisely -RRB- . is it possible that someting similar is true for all compact groups ? p.s. as far as i understand -LRB- marc palm mentions this here -RRB- , the situation becomes simpler if we replace <m> C ( G ) </m> by <m> C ^ \infty ( G ) </m> . i would be grateful if somebody could clarify details or give references .
say i have a ring , <m> R </m> , with 1 which i consider my universe , and i know its group of units <m> G = \mathbb { G } _ m ( R ) </m> . then given a subgroup , <m> H \le G </m> , can i determine if there is there a subring <m> S _ H </m> such that <m> \mathbb { G } _ m ( S ) = H </m> ? if so , is <m> S _ H </m> unique with this group of units ? if so , is there in fact a -- canonical in the sense above -- 1-1 correspondence between subgroups of <m> G </m> and subrings of <m> R </m> with 1 ? preliminary attempts at a solution do n't indicate any problems with the truth of the statement , but naturally one should be skeptical of limited data especially in a subject with so many intricacies as groups and rings . the motivating example is <m> \overline { \mathbb { Q } } / \mathbb { Q } </m> , due to some interesting number theory that could come out of such a correspondence . in the case of fields the question is supposed to collapse into the question `` can i add 0 to a subgroup of the group of units of some big field and get a subfield without doing anything else ? '' there is no possibility for general rings , but are there assumptions on <m> R </m> or <m> G </m> which can ensure existence or uniqueness ? and it is also fine to induce assumptions on what kind of <m> S </m> we are allowed to have as well , fields instead of just rings for example .
theorem 3.2 of the paper `` quantum cohomology of the springer resolution '' by braverman , maulik and okounkov relates equivariant quantum cohomology of the cotangent bundle of <m> G / B </m> to the trigonometric dunkl operators . a naive guess -LRB- or maybe wag ? -RRB- is that replacing cohomology with <m> K </m> - theory gives the dunkl representation of the daha . an explanation -LRB- or reference to an explanation -RRB- of what -LRB- if any -RRB- significant obstacles remain for doing the <m> K </m> - theoretic analog of bmo will be greatly appreciated ! is it the sort of thing that should be straightforward -LRB- though perhaps technical -RRB- at this point ? i 'd prefer an answer that addresses these particular varieties , rather than general foundational problems .
intuitively , i want to construct the functional f in this way : <m> F ( f ) = \lim _ { x \rightarrow 0 + } f ( x ) - \lim _ { x \rightarrow 0 - } f ( x ) </m> for <m> f \in L ^ \infty </m> . i know this is not well defined so i 'd like to find a way to use this idea . maybe find an extension using hahn-banach , etc.
for <m> \mu , \nu \in \mathbb { C } ^ 2 </m> we denote <m> I ( \mu , \nu ) </m> to be the principal series of <m> \mathrm { G L } _ 2 ( \mathbb { Q } _ p ) </m> induced from <m> | . | ^ \mu \otimes | . | ^ \nu </m> . for <m> s = \mu - \nu </m> one defines the standard intertwining operator <m> M ( s ) : I ( \mu , \nu ) \to I ( \nu , \mu ) , \quad \Re ( s ) > 0 </m> by <m> f \mapsto \{ g \mapsto \int _ N f ( w n g ) d n \} . </m> one can analytically continue <m> M ( s ) </m> by introducing suitable normalization , e.g. <m> M ^ * ( s ) : = \frac { 1 - p ^ { - s } } { 1 - p ^ { - 1 } } M ( s ) , </m> which is holomorphic everywhere . one can also check that the operator vanishes whenever <m> \mu - \nu = - 1 </m> . one can also compute that , for an absolute constant <m> C </m> -LRB- depending on <m> p </m> -RRB- <m> M ^ * ( - s ) M ^ * ( s ) = C ( 1 - p ^ { \mu - \nu - 1 } ) ( 1 - p ^ { \nu - \mu - 1 } ) . </m> on the other hand if <m> I ( \mu , \nu ) </m> is tempered i.e. <m> \mu , \nu \in i \mathbb { R } </m> we can compute the <m> L ^ 2 </m> norms of the vectors in the whittaker model of <m> I ( \mu , \nu ) </m> , where the inner product is taken in the corresponding kirillov model . i checked that the squared <m> L ^ 2 </m> norms of the spherical vectors <m> W </m> in the whittaker model with <m> W ( 1 ) = 1 </m> have <m> ( 1 - p ^ { \mu - \nu - 1 } ) ( 1 - p ^ { \nu - \mu - 1 } ) </m> in the denominators . for the spherical vector <m> W </m> in the whittaker model of <m> I ( \mu , \nu ) </m> with <m> W ( 1 ) = 1 </m> ,
this is a re-post from mse as i did not get any response there . let <m> r _ 2 ( n ) </m> denote the number of ways in which a positive integer <m> n </m> can be expressed as the sum of squares of two integers . here the sign as well as order of summands matters . also by convention we set <m> r _ 2 ( 0 ) = 1 </m> . g. h. hardy mentions the following formula in his book ramanujan : twelve lectures on subjects suggested by his life and work -LRB- see page <m> 8 2 </m> -RRB- <m> \sum _ { 0 \leq n < x } \frac { r _ 2 ( n ) } { \sqrt { x - n } } = 2 \pi \sqrt { x } + \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \frac { r _ 2 ( n ) } { \sqrt { n } } \sin 2 \pi \sqrt { n x } \tag { 1 } </m> this is preceded by mention of another formula of ramanujan <m> \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { r _ { 2 } ( n ) } { \sqrt { n + a } } e ^ { - 2 \pi \sqrt { ( n + a ) b } } = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { r _ { 2 } ( n ) } { \sqrt { n + b } } e ^ { - 2 \pi \sqrt { ( n + b ) a } } \tag { 2 } </m> which is proved here . next hardy says that the above formula of ramanujan is valid when <m> \sqrt { a } , \sqrt { b } </m> have positive real parts . putting <m> a = x e ^ { i t } </m> for <m> x > 0 , x \notin \mathbb { Z } , 0 < t < \pi </m> in <m> ( 2 ) </m> and letting <m> t \to \pi </m> followed by equating imaginary parts and setting <m> b = 0 </m> the relation <m> ( 1 ) </m> is obtained . and then comes the remark `` this deduction , of course , is not a proof of <m> ( 1 ) </m> and i do not know that there is any proof standing in the literature '' .

a short variant of pitt 's theorem is the followig : for <m> 1 \leq p < r < \infty </m> holds <m> \mathcal { B } ( \ell _ r ( \mathbb { N } ) , \ell _ p ( \mathbb { N } ) ) = \mathcal { K } ( \ell _ r ( \mathbb { N } ) , \ell _ p ( \mathbb { N } ) ) </m> now let <m> S _ 1 , S _ 2 </m> two infinite sets and at least one is uncountable . is it still true that <m> \mathcal { B } ( \ell _ r ( S _ 1 ) , \ell _ p ( S _ 2 ) ) = \mathcal { K } ( \ell _ r ( S _ 1 ) , \ell _ p ( S _ 2 ) \quad ? </m> i 've tried to mimic standard proof of pitt 's from albiac kalton , but got stuck since unit ball of <m> \ell _ r ( S _ 1 ) </m> with weak topology not necesseary metriazable .
let <m> a _ 1 , \ldots , a _ n \in \mathbb { Z } ^ k </m> . i need to check if <m> a _ 1 , \ldots , a _ n </m> is a generating set of <m> \mathbb { Z } ^ k </m> , that is , every vector <m> v \in \mathbb { Z } ^ k </m> can be represented as an integer linear combination <m> v = \sum c _ i a _ i </m> with all <m> c _ i \in \mathbb { Z } </m> . note that the set <m> a _ 1 , \ldots , a _ n </m> may be redundant in the sense some <m> a _ i </m> may be a linear combination of other elements . the question is : what is the fastest practical way to check this ? it seems that lll algorithm can be used in some way , but its complexity leaves something to be desired , also the present problem is very resticted compared to lattice reduction . i would appreciate any reference to a faster algorithm that solves this problem .
this is question 3.87 from fabian 's functional analysis and infinite-dimensional geometry . the result is credited to lin and troyanski . where on the net can i read a proof of this lemma ? any help would be appreciated . definition : the book defines a slice of a subset <m> C </m> of a banach space <m> X </m> , to be a nonempty intersection with an open half space of <m> X </m> . lemma : let <m> X </m> be a banach space , and let <m> x </m> be an extreme point for its unit ball . assume that the relative norm and the weak topology coincide at <m> x </m> . show that the slices form a neighborhood base of the norm topology . edit : the book advices to consider the point <m> j ( x ) </m> , where <m> j </m> is the naturall isometry to the by-dual and prove that it is an extreme point for the unit ball there . to this end assume <m> j ( x ) </m> is not extreme , i.e. <m> j ( x ) = \frac { 1 } { 2 } ( x _ 1 + x _ 2 ) , x _ i \in B _ { X ^ { * * } } </m> now by a geometric argument show that the relative <m> \omega ^ \ast </m> , and the relative norm topologies for <m> B _ { X ^ { * * } } </m> coincide at <m> x _ i </m> and so forth . p.s. i believe the statement in the last sentence is the essence of the question and of potential interest to this community . at least it was n't getting any attention on math.se , hence i asked them to migrate it here . any help would be appreciated .

i 've been working with rieffel 's `` projective modules over higher-dimensional non-commutative tori '' and i 'm struggling with a few basic questions . i know that when the dimension <m> d = 2 </m> we have that <m> T _ \theta </m> is specified by a single -LRB- say irrational -RRB- number <m> \theta </m> , and then <m> K _ 0 ( T _ \theta ) = \mathbb { Z } + \theta \mathbb { Z } </m> . further , classes <m> a + \theta b </m> in <m> K _ 0 </m> are represented by actual vector bundles if the `` rank '' , or more appropriately the trace , satisfies <m> a + \theta b > 0 </m> . now in general there is a formula -LRB- theorem 3.4 -RRB- in this paper which gives the trace <m> \tau ( [ V ] ) = | G / D ^ \perp | </m> if <m> V </m> is the projective module over <m> T _ \theta </m> given by the schwartz space <m> \mathcal { S } ( M ) </m> with <m> \mathbb { Z } ^ d \simeq D \hookrightarrow G = \hat M \times M </m> a cocompact embedding of a lattice into a product <m> \hat M \times M </m> of a locally compact abelian group and its dual , and the action of <m> T _ \theta </m> is given by restricting the natural action of <m> \hat M \times M </m> on <m> \mathcal { S } ( M ) </m> . the only ingredient left is the normalizaton of the haar measure on <m> G </m> which would let us calculate <m> | G / D ^ \perp | </m> , which the paper says is given by any normalization on <m> M </m> and then the plancharel measure on <m> \hat M </m> . is there a concise description of the order structure on <m> K _ 0 ( T _ \theta ) </m> when <m> d = 3 </m> or <m> d = 4 </m> or higher dimensions as there is when <m> d = 2 </m> ?

background given a -LRB- translation bounded -RRB- positive definite measure <m> \gamma </m> lets say on <m> \mathbb R ^ d </m> , its fourier transform as a tempered distribution is a positive measure <m> \widehat { \gamma } </m> . i am interested in the lesbegue decomposition <m> \widehat { \gamma } = \widehat { \gamma } _ { p p } + \widehat { \gamma } _ { a c } + \widehat { \gamma } _ { s c } </m> at the level of <m> \gamma </m> . the decomposition <m> \widehat { \gamma } = \widehat { \gamma } _ { p p } + \widehat { \gamma } _ { c } </m> is well understood , so the problem reduces simply to understanding the decomposition of the continuous component . so , the main question becomes : given a measure <m> \gamma </m> such that <m> \widehat { \gamma } </m> is continuous , how can we identify <m> \gamma _ 1 , \gamma _ 2 </m> such that <m> \widehat { \gamma _ 1 } </m> is a.c. and <m> \widehat { \gamma _ 2 } </m> is s.c. ? note that <m> \gamma _ 1 , \gamma _ 2 </m> might actually not be measures . this leads to : the question if we fix a compact set <m> K \subset \mathbb R ^ d </m> , can we get a nice description of the set <m> \{ \widehat { f } | f \in L ^ 1 ( \mathbb R ^ d ) , \operatorname { s u p p } ( f ) \subset K \} \, ? </m> note that for the type of problem i am interested , convolving <m> f </m> with a continuous compactly supported function is ok . so any extra restriction on <m> f </m> which can be obtained by convolutions with a class of compactly supported continuous functions -LRB- for example <m> f </m> is continuous -RRB- is ok . also , the condition <m> \operatorname { s u p p } ( f ) \subset K </m> can be replaced by <m> f </m> compactly supported .

how is the weight <m> J ( - ) </m> determined in this characterization of the category of element of a copresheaf as a coend ? http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+of+elements#properties_11 the functor el -LRB- - -RRB- seems to admit a right adjoint given by <m> D \to K ( D ) </m> : <m> c \mapsto O b ( [ J c , D ] ) </m> , which would imply cocontinuity ; am i right in deducing this from a purely formal-nonsense argument ? i 'm trying to unravel the coend definition in the simple example of the action groupoid of a g-set , to see if i 'm able to find what <m> J </m> has to be at least in that case . maybe this is linked to the presence of an adjoint for the functor <m> X \mapsto X / / G </m> from g-sets to groupoids . does anybody know a reference for that ? thanks .
... are all isomorphic to <m> l ^ 1 </m> on some other index set . at least , that much i `` know '' from 2nd-hand sources , since the original proof is apparently in a paper of köthe from the 1930s 1960s -LRB- in german -RRB- that i ca n't get hold of have had trouble digesting . since there are some banach space specialists reading mo , i wondered if someone could sketch how the proof differs from the countable case , or point to a more recent text , preferably in english or french , that gives the proof ? i hope this is a well-defined question for mo , since i 'm not baiting with something where i know the answer . -LRB- some background for other readers : the analogous result when <m> X </m> is countably infinite follows from combining two steps : one first uses a block basis argument to show that a closed , complemented subspace <m> V </m> inside <m> l ^ 1 ( \bf N ) </m> must either be finite-dimensional , or contain an infinite-dimensional , closed complemented subspace <m> W </m> that is isomorphic to <m> \ell ^ 1 ( { \bf N } ) </m> . in the former case , <m> V </m> is then obviously isomorphic to some finite-dimensional <m> \ell ^ 1 </m> . in the latter case , one applies pelczynski decomposition . my impression is that it 's the first step which might prove problematic if attempted for <m> \ell ^ 1 ( X ) </m> when <m> X </m> is uncountably infinite , but i could well be wrong and would welcome corrections . -RRB-

on 2010 akhmedov and park claimed there are infinitely many exotic smooth structures on <m> S ^ 2 \times S ^ 2 </m> , see http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3346 then rasmussen posted a paper : perfect morse functions and exotic <m> S ^ 2 \times S ^ 2 </m> 's http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4674 but he withdrawn his paper , here is his note :
it is known that lie superalgebra <m> \mathfrak { s u } ( 2 | 2 ) </m> -LRB- and only this one , not arbitrary <m> \mathfrak { s u } ( n | n ) </m> -RRB- has the nontrivial central extension which forms an <m> \mathfrak { s l } _ 2 </m> triplet , let 's call it <m> ( \mathfrak { C } , \mathfrak { P } , \mathfrak { K } ) </m> . the easiest way to see this is to start from the superalgebra <m> \mathfrak { d } ( 2 , 1 , \alpha ) </m> and take <m> \alpha = 0 </m> . an <m> \mathfrak { s l } _ 2 </m> automorphism allows one to rotate the vector <m> ( \mathfrak { C } , \mathfrak { P } , \mathfrak { K } ) </m> and transform it to e.g. <m> ( \mathfrak { C } ' , 0 , 0 ) </m> for some <m> \mathfrak { C } ' </m> . it turns out that representation theory of the algebra with the central extension <m> ( \mathfrak { C } ' , 0 , 0 ) </m> -LRB- when two elements vanish -RRB- is much easier than the one with a full <m> ( \mathfrak { C } , \mathfrak { P } , \mathfrak { K } ) </m> . now let us consider quantum deformation of of this algebra - <m> U _ q ( \mathfrak { s u } ( 2 | 2 ) ) </m> . the question is how to generalize the outer automorphism to this case if one exists at all . i need this to build up a representation theory for the above superalgebra . i understand that the question is technical , it 's hard to realize its complexity without doing any explicit calculations , but , just in case , if anybody thought about something related , please let me know .
is there a manifold <m> M </m> for which <m> \chi ^ { \infty } ( M ) </m> , the lie algebra of smooth vector fields on <m> M </m> contains all finite dimensional lie algebras -LRB- up to isomorphism -RRB- ? a weaker question : is there a manifold <m> M </m> such that for every <m> n > 0 </m> , <m> \chi ^ { \infty } ( M ) </m> contains an n dimensional lie subalgebra ?
solutions of <m> x ( y ^ 2 - x - 1 ) = n </m> are easy to enumerate assuming <m> n </m> is factored . appears a quadratic must have solutions <m> \mod \text { d i v i s o r s o f } \frac { n } { x } </m> for each solution <m> ( x , y ) </m> . if this is correct is there an algorithm to choose the primes so the quadratic has solutions mod many divisors ? if one drops <m> - 1 </m> the case is unbounded using the scaling <m> ( x , y , n ) \to ( x d ^ 2 , y d , n d ^ 4 ) </m> . current best is n = 148127975424000 with 30 positive solutions .
i 'm looking for the smallest <m> n \in \mathbb { N } </m> that solves the following equation : <m> 2 ^ n = 1 \mod m </m> for an odd <m> m </m> . i know that little fermat theorem and euler totient give me a solution but they do n't give me the smallest <m> n </m> . for example <m> \varphi ( 7 ) = 6 </m> but the smallest is <m> n = 3 </m> . this problem is associated with the perfect shuffle problem in card games . given an even number of cards -LRB- m +1 -RRB- , and an initial configuration , how many times -LRB- n -RRB- it is necessary to do perfect shuffles to obtain the same starting configuration .
let <m> X </m> be the vector space of all lebesgue-measurable functions <m> f : \left [ a , b \right ] \rightarrow </m> such that <m> \int ^ { b } _ { a } \left | f \left ( x \right ) \right | ^ { 2 } d x < \infty </m> -LRB- lebesgue integral -RRB- . then we can define an equivalence relation on <m> X </m> as follows : <m> f \cong g </m> if <m> f ( x ) = g ( x ) </m> almost everywhere on <m> \left [ a , b \right ] </m> . then we construct equivalence classes <m> \tilde { f } = \{ g \in X : f \cong g \} </m> , and the vector space of these equivalence classes is <m> L ^ { 2 } [ a , b ] </m> , on which we define the norm <m> | | \tilde { f } | | _ { 1 } = \sqrt { \int ^ { b } _ { a } \left | f \left ( x \right ) \right | ^ { 2 } d x } </m> -LRB- lebesgue integral -RRB- . now some of these equivalences classes are rather special : they contain a continuous function in them , so this is the natural choice for a representative of the equivalence class . let <m> D \subseteq L ^ { 2 } [ a , b ] </m> be the subspace containing these special equivalence classes . my basic question is , if we assign the equivalence classes in <m> D </m> their continuous representatives , what are the natural representatives of the other equivalence classes ? we can make this more precise . let <m> C [ a , b ] </m> be the vector space of continuous functions <m> f : \left [ a , b \right ] \rightarrow </m> , endowed with a norm <m> | | f | | _ { 2 } = \sqrt { \int ^ { b } _ { a } \left | f \left ( x \right ) \right | ^ { 2 } d x } </m> -LRB- riemann or lebesgue integral -RRB- . then the norm-completion of this space is in fact <m> L ^ { 2 } [ a , b ] </m> . the upshot of all this is that <m> D </m> is dense in <m> L ^ { 2 } [ a , b ] </m> , and we have a norm-respecting isomorphism <m> T : ( D , | | \cdot | | _ { 1 } ) \rightarrow ( C [ a , b ] , | | \cdot | | _ { 2 } ) </m> defined by <m> T ( \tilde { f } ) \in \tilde { f } </m> -LRB- assigning each element of <m> D </m> its continuous representative -RRB- . so now the question becomes , does there exist a continuous linear extension <m> S </m> of <m> T </m> defined on all of <m> L ^ { 2 } [ a , b ] </m> such that <m> S | _ { D } = T </m> and <m> S ( \tilde { f } ) \in \tilde { f } </m> ? well , <m> T </m> is a bounded linear transformation -LRB- with operator norm 1 -RRB- defined on a dense subspace , so it meets all the conditions of the blt theorem other than the fact that its codomain is not a banach space . thus we have to expand <m> C [ a , b ] </m> to a larger subspace of <m> X </m> , so that the codomain of <m> T </m> becomes complete . there are two potential ways to do this , depending on whether we define the norm <m> | | \cdot | | _ { 2 } </m> in terms of riemann or lebesgue integrals . if we use riemann integrals , we would need a subspace of <m> X </m> consisting of riemann-integrable functions , so we would have to answer the following in order to establish completeness : if <m> f _ { n } \rightarrow f </m> with respect to the the <m> | | \cdot | | _ { 2 } </m> -LRB- where <m> f </m> need not be continuous -RRB- , is <m> f </m> necessarily riemann integrable ? -LRB- my first instinct is no , because riemann-integrability requires boundedness , and you can have a sequence of continuous functions with ever-increasing bounds , so that the limit is unbounded -RRB- . if we use lebesgue integrals , we would need to ensure that two distinct elements of the subspace can not have zero distance , so we would have to answer the following : if <m> f _ { n } \rightarrow f </m> and <m> g _ { n } \rightarrow g </m> with respect to the <m> | | \cdot | | _ { 2 } </m> norm -LRB- where <m> f </m> and <m> g </m> need not be continuous -RRB- and <m> f ( x ) = g ( x ) </m> almost everywhere on <m> [ a , b ] </m> , then are <m> f </m> and <m> g </m> necessarily the same function ? -LRB- again i fear the answer is no , because perhaps you can have a sequence of continuous functions that converges to a function with a removable discontinuity -RRB- . i know i 've included a lot of convoluted detail , but my fundamental question is relatively simple : can we replace the equivalence classes in <m> L ^ { 2 } [ a , b ] </m> with natural representative functions , using continuous representatives where possible ? or to put it another way : does there exist a subspace <m> Y </m> of <m> X </m> containing <m> C [ a , b ] </m> , on which we can define a norm which will make it isomorphic to <m> L ^ { 2 } [ a , b ] </m> ? edit : as gerald has pointed out , a simpler way to phrase my question is that i want a lifting of <m> L ^ { 2 } [ a , b ] </m> or more generally <m> L ^ { 2 } ( ^ { 3 } ) </m> . any help would be greatly appreciated . thank you in advance .
if there is no restriction on <m> n </m> , this is a famous open problem . i 'm wondering if any recent work has been done for small <m> n > 6 </m> . i believe the question is answered -LRB- positively -RRB- for <m> n = 6 </m> by watatani -LRB- 1996 -RRB- mr1409040 and aschbacher -LRB- 2008 -RRB- mr2393428 . i also believe we can answer it for <m> n = 7 </m> , with one possible exception . the exceptional case is shown below .

the number <m> 1 2 </m> -LRB- or , probably we shall say bernoulli numbers in general -RRB- appears in many places in mathematics , sometimes leading to unexpected connections between different topics . for instance , some time ago there was a very interesting explanation for 1 -RRB- its occurrence in the todd class and 2 -RRB- its occurrence in the euler-maclaurin formula in terms of riemann-roch for toric varieties , as explained in : euler-maclaurin formula and riemann-roch =========================================================== my question is , will there be some relation between 1 -RRB- and 3 -RRB- its occurrence in the baker-campbell-hausdorff formula . i guess this might be related to some explicit local expressions in some method of proving the index theorem on lie groups , or even the duflo map -LRB- which i do n't really understand -RRB- . thank you very much .
let <m> \mathcal { C } </m> be a simplicial category , such that for any two objects <m> X , Y \in \mathcal { C } </m> , <m> \text { H o m } _ { \mathcal { C } } ( X , Y ) </m> is a simplicial commutative monoid . is the simplicial nerve <m> \text { N } ( \mathcal { C } ) </m> an <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - category ? if for any two objects <m> X , Y \in \mathcal { C } </m> , <m> \text { H o m } _ { \mathcal { C } } ( X , Y ) </m> was a simplicial abelian group , this would be true as a consequence of prop. 1.1.5.10 in j. lurie 's higher topos theory . thanks

how to prove the monotonicity of the following function ? <m> f ( x ) = \frac { \sum \limits _ { i = 1 } ^ K \ln ( 1 + a _ i x ) } { \sum \limits _ { i = 1 } ^ K \ln ( 1 + \frac { 1 } { 2 } a _ i x ) } </m> . where <m> a _ i > 0 </m> , <m> \forall i </m> , <m> x > 0 </m> . i have proved that <m> \frac { h _ i ( x ) } { g _ i ( x ) } = \frac { \ln ( 1 + a _ i x ) } { \ln ( 1 + \frac { 1 } { 2 } a _ i x ) } </m> is a monotonically decreasing function with <m> x </m> . actually , <m> f ( x ) </m> is also monotonically decreasing with <m> x </m> , which can be proved by simple simulation . but i ca n't give the rigorous proof . any help is appreciated . thanks a lot !
let <m> S _ n </m> be the symmetric group of all the permutations of <m> \{ 1 , \ldots , n \} </m> . motivated by question 315568 -LRB- http://mathoverflow.net/questions/315568 -RRB- , here i pose the following question . question : is it true that for each integer <m> n > 5 </m> we have <m> \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ n \frac 1 { k + \pi ( k ) } = 1 </m> for some odd -LRB- or even -RRB- permutation <m> \pi \in S _ n </m> ? let <m> a _ n </m> be the number of all permutations <m> \pi \in S _ n </m> with <m> \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ n ( k + \pi ( k ) ) ^ { - 1 } = 1 </m> . via mathematica , i find that <m> a _ 1 = a _ 2 = a _ 3 = a _ 5 = 0 , \ a _ 4 = 1 , \ a _ 6 = 7 , \, a _ 7 = 6 , \ a _ 8 = 3 0 , \ a _ 9 = 1 1 0 , \ a _ { 1 0 } = 2 7 8 , \ a _ { 1 1 } = 1 3 3 2 . </m> for example , <m> ( 1 , 4 , 3 , 2 ) </m> is the unique -LRB- odd -RRB- permutation in <m> S _ 4 </m> meeting our requirement for <m> n = 4 </m> ; in fact , <m> \frac 1 { 1 + 1 } + \frac 1 { 2 + 4 } + \frac 1 { 3 + 3 } + \frac 1 { 4 + 2 } = 1 . </m> for <m> n = 1 1 </m> , we may take the odd permutation <m> ( 4 , 8 , 9 , 1 1 , 1 0 , 6 , 5 , 7 , 3 , 2 , 1 ) </m> since <m>  </m> has the value <m> 1 </m> , we may also take the even permutation <m> ( 5 , 6 , 7 , 1 1 , 1 0 , 4 , 9 , 8 , 3 , 2 , 1 ) </m> to meet the reuirement . i conjecture that the question has a positive answer . your comments are welcome ！ ps : after my initial posting of this question , brian hopkins pointed out that a073112 -LRB- <m> n </m> -RRB- on oeis gives the number of permutations <m> p \in S _ n </m> with <m> \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ n \frac 1 { k + p ( k ) } \in \mathbb Z </m> , but a073112 contains no comment or conjecture .
considering the success of a previous question involving eulerian numbers , i thought i might throw this question into the mix . it comes from some localization computations in gw theory , but in this form is purely combinatorial . eulerian numbers of the second kind are defined by the recursion relation <m> \left \langle \left \langle n \atop m \right \rangle \right \rangle = ( m + 1 ) \left \langle \left \langle n - 1 \atop m \right \rangle \right \rangle + ( 2 n - m - 1 ) \left \langle \left \langle n - 1 \atop m - 1 \right \rangle \right \rangle </m> with the initial conditions <m> \left \langle \left \langle n \atop 0 \right \rangle \right \rangle = 1 </m> and <m> \left \langle \left \langle n \atop m \right \rangle \right \rangle </m> = 0 for <m> m \geq n </m> . for references , see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eulerian_number and http://oeis.org/classic/a008517 . the following three statements are known :
a graph is said to have optimal vertex connectivity if its vertex connectivity equals its minimum degree . according to this arxiv preprint , it was shown by mader in -LRB- arch . math. , 1970 -RRB- and -LRB- math . ann. , 1971 -RRB- that a connected vertex-transitive graph without <m> K _ 4 </m> has optimal vertex connectivity . my question is : which of the two papers by mader mentioned above proves this result , and what is the exact statement of this result ? this result implies that all connected vertex-transitive graphs with clique number 2 or 3 have optimal vertex connectivity . in particular , all connected cayley graphs generated by transpositions -LRB- these graphs are bipartite -RRB- have optimal vertex connectivity .
obtain <m> M \in \{ - 1 , + 1 \} ^ { n \times n } </m> by unbiased coin flipping . what is known about the distribution of permanent <m> \mathsf { P e r m } ( M ) </m> ? it seems to be bimodal . given a function <m> g ( n ) </m> what is the function <m> f ( m ) </m> -LRB- at least approximately -RRB- such that probability <m> \mathsf { P r o b } \big ( | \mathsf { P e r m } ( M ) | \in \big ( \mathsf { E } [ | \mathsf { P e r m } ( M ) | ] - g ( n ) , \mathsf { E } [ | \mathsf { P e r m } ( M ) | ] + g ( n ) \big ) \big ) \geq f ( n ) </m> holds for some <m> a > 0 </m> where <m> \mathsf { E } [ | \mathsf { P e r m } ( M ) | ] </m> is expected absolute value permanent over <m> { M \in \{ - 1 , + 1 \} ^ { n \times n } } </m> ?
let <m> P = M N </m> be a parabolic subgroup of a <m> p </m> - adic reductive group <m> G </m> with split component <m> A _ M </m> . there is bijection from the set of parabolic subgroups of <m> G </m> with levi <m> M </m> and the chambers of <m> \mathfrak a _ M </m> with respect to the hyperplanes <m> H _ { \alpha } = \{ h \in \mathfrak a _ M : \alpha \in \Phi ( A _ M , G ) \} </m> , where <m> P </m> corresponds to the chamber <m> \{ h \in \mathfrak a _ M : \langle h , \alpha \rangle > 0 \textrm { f o r a l l } \alpha \in \Phi ( A _ M , N ) \} </m> a parabolic subgroup <m> P ' = M N ' </m> is said to be adjacent to <m> P </m> if the chambers of <m> P </m> and <m> P ' </m> are separated by a single hyperplane <m> H _ { \alpha } </m> . then there is a unique simple root <m> \alpha </m> of <m> A _ M </m> in <m> N </m> for which <m> - \alpha </m> is a simple root of <m> A _ M </m> in <m> N ' </m> . let <m> K </m> be a maximal compact open subgroup of <m> G </m> in good position relative to <m> P </m> and <m> P ' </m> , so that the harish-chandra map <m> H _ P </m> extends to <m> G </m> via the equation <m> G = P K </m> . let <m> \alpha ^ { \vee } \in \mathfrak a _ M </m> be the coroot corresponding to <m> \alpha </m> , and suppose <m> n ' \in \overline { N } \cap N ' </m> . is it true that <m> H _ P ( n ' ) </m> is proportional to <m> \alpha ^ { \vee } </m> ? this is claimed in waldspurger 's writeup on harish-chandra 's notes on the proof of the convergence of intertwining operators :
a golomb ruler can be described as a set of marks on a line having integer positions , such that no two pairs of marks are separated by the same distance . call the spectrum of a ruler the -LRB- multi - -RRB- set of distances measured by the ruler . for example , consider a ruler <m> G _ 3 </m> on <m> n = 3 + 1 </m> marks , with marks at <m> \{ 0 , 1 , 4 , 6 \} </m> . the spectrum of <m> G _ 3 </m> is <m> \{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \} </m> . in this case , <m> G _ 3 </m> is perfect , in that every distance between <m> 1 </m> and <m> 6 </m> inclusive can be measured . define the <m> L ^ 2 </m> norm of a set of marks as the square root of the sum of squares of the multiplicity of the spectrum . for example , a ruler with marks at <m> \{ 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 \} </m> has a spectrum of <m> \{ 1 , 2 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 5 , 7 , 8 \} </m> , and thus an <m> L ^ 2 </m> norm of <m> ( 1 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 2 + 1 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 2 + 1 ^ 2 + 1 ^ 2 ) ^ { 1 / 2 } = 4 </m> . the requirement of having no two distances measured twice seems overly narrowing . for example , there may be some applications , in , say , radio astronomy , where allowing a repeat measurement every now and then may be acceptable . thus , i consider a `` generalized '' optimal ruler <m> G _ { m , k } </m> -LRB- not great name -RRB- that , instead of having no two pairs of marks separated by the same distance , minimizes such an <m> L ^ 2 </m> norm over all rulers on <m> m </m> marks of length <m> k </m> . for a golomb ruler , the <m> L ^ 2 </m> norm of an <m> ( m + 1 ) </m> - mark ruler is <m> \sqrt { m ( m - 1 ) / 2 } </m> , but there might be clever constructions to stuff marks onto a ruler that has a nice spectrum with small <m> l ^ 2 </m> norm .
fix a stable <m> \infty </m> - category <m> \mathcal { C } </m> and two -LRB- co -RRB- fibre sequences <m> a \rightarrow b \rightarrow c </m> and <m> x \rightarrow y \rightarrow z </m> in <m> \mathcal { C } </m> . now suppose we are given a map <m> a \rightarrow x </m> such that the composite <m> c [ - 1 ] \rightarrow a \rightarrow x \rightarrow y </m> is homotopic to zero . from this data , i would like to extend the map <m> a \rightarrow x </m> to a map of -LRB- co -RRB- fibre sequences <m> \begin {array} { c c c c c c } & a & \rightarrow & b & \rightarrow & c \\ \ \\ \ & \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow \\ \ \\ \ & x & \rightarrow & y & \rightarrow & z \\ \ \end {array} </m> and i would like to know exactly what choices are involved in such an extension . i believe that such an extension exists : the universal property of cofibre sequences should give a map <m> b \rightarrow y </m> so that we have the first two vertical arrows in a map of -LRB- co -RRB- fibre sequences , and then the argument that the homotopy category of <m> \mathcal { C } </m> is triangulated allows us to construct the third vertical arrow <m> c \rightarrow z </m> . now the question is the following : what choices are involved in the construction of the vertical arrows ? for the second vertical arrow , <m> b \rightarrow y </m> , i think that the universal property of cofibre sequences should say that i need to actually specify a homotopy from the composite <m> c [ - 1 ] \rightarrow a \rightarrow x \rightarrow y </m> to zero . is that correct ? to construct the third vertical arrow , <m> c \rightarrow z </m> , we would likewise need to specify a homotopy from the composite <m> a \rightarrow b \rightarrow y \rightarrow z </m> to zero , but it seems to me that this is already given by the previous choices . is that correct ? if so , then we can fill in the third vertical arrow more or less canonically . is this one of the ways in which stable <m> \infty </m> - categories are richer than triangulated categories , in which we have only the existence of some third vertical arrow <m> c \rightarrow z </m> ? -LRB- edit : thanks to david white for providing the above diagram for the map of cofibre sequences . -RRB-
let <m> G </m> be a finite abelian <m> p </m> - group -LRB- where <m> p </m> is a prime -RRB- . suppose there exists a symmetric bilinear map <m> \delta \colon G \times G \to \mathbb { Q } / \mathbb { Z } </m> such that the induced map <m> g \to \langle g , \; \rangle </m> , is an isomorphism from <m> G </m> to <m> \mathrm { H o m } ( G , \mathbb { Q } / \mathbb { Z } ) </m> . then , is it true that <m> G </m> can be written as <m> \mathbf { Z } _ p ^ n / \, \mathrm { i m } ( A ) </m> for some symmetric matrix -LRB- i.e. a linear map -RRB- <m> A \colon \mathbf { Z } _ p ^ n \to \mathbf { Z } _ p ^ n </m> for some positive integer <m> n </m> ? -LRB- here <m> \mathbf { Z } _ p </m> denotes the <m> p </m> - adic integers -RRB- edit2 : as user74230 has pointed out , the isomorphism <m> G \to \mathbf { Z } _ p ^ n / \, \mathrm { i m } ( A ) </m> has to respect the evident bilinear forms on both sides . -LRB- otherwise , the answer is trivial and <m> A </m> does not depend on <m> \delta </m> as amritanshu prasad has pointed out -RRB- . edit1 : i had this question while reading the following paper : http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.5129v1 . in theorem 2 of page 4 it says that , given a <m> p </m> - group with duality pairing <m> ( G , \delta ) </m> the probability -LRB- w.r.t. haar measure -RRB- that <m> \mathrm { c o k e r } ( A ) \cong ( G , \delta ) </m> converges to cohen-lenstra type probability measure when <m> n \to \infty </m> . the existance of the duality pairing seems relevant for this theorem , but amritanshu prasad 's comment suggests that <m> A </m> can be chosen independent of the pairing which seems puzzling for me .
all of the models of ch which i know of also satisfy <m> \diamondsuit </m> . what is the easiest way to produce a model of ch wherein <m> \diamondsuit </m> is false ?
i posted this question at math.stackexchange.com but did n't get an answer . motivation physicists are in search for a model of discrete space -LRB- - time -RRB- for a long time . so i wondered why not start with a `` somehow discrete '' space ? how far do we get ? question can we alter the axioms of euclidean space , e.g. hilbert 's axioms , to have <m> \mathbb { Q } ^ 3 </m> as a unique model ? the crucial axioms seem to be the congruence axioms iv .1 and iv .4 , and presumably the line completeness axiom v. 2 . but how are they to be modified ? iv .1 might be replaced by requiring that there are counter-examples -LRB- irrationality of <m> \sqrt { 2 } </m> -RRB- and appropriately relaxing `` congruent '' to `` almost congruent '' -LRB- = `` arbitrarily close to congruence '' -RRB- . but what about line completeness then , since it might be possible to add irrational points to <m> \mathbb { Q } ^ 3 </m> such that the modified axioms still hold ?
let <m> p \geq 5 </m> be a prime . let <m> Y ( p ) </m> be the fine moduli space representing elliptic curves + basis of the <m> p </m> - torsion over <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> and let <m> Y _ 0 ( p ) </m> be the fine moduli space representing elliptic curves + point of <m> p </m> - torsion over <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> . we know that <m> Y _ 0 ( p ) </m> has a model over <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> whose special fiber is a union of two copies of <m> Y _ 0 ( 1 ) : = \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> meeting transversaly at supersingular points . my question : what is the analogous description of the special fiber for <m> Y ( p ) </m> -LRB- for some suitable model over <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> -RRB- ? what is the explicit description of the natural map <m> Y ( p ) \rightarrow Y _ 0 ( p ) </m> at the level of special fibers ? i guess it 's in katz -- mazur , but the purpose of my question is to get an answer as self-contained as possible . i do n't -LRB- necessarily -RRB- ask for the idea of the proof .
let <m> \phi ( \cdot ) </m> and <m> \Phi ( \cdot ) </m> be the probability and cumulative density functions , respectively , of a random variable with distribution <m> \text { N } ( 0 , \, 1 ) </m> . that is , <m> \forall x \in \mathbb { R } : \, \phi ( x ) = \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 2 \cdot \pi } } \cdot \text { e } ^ { - x ^ 2 / 2 } </m> and <m> \forall x \in \mathbb { R } : \, \Phi ( x ) = \int _ { - \infty } ^ { x } \phi ( u ) \, \text { d } u . </m> i was wondering if you could help me to compute <m> \int _ { - \infty } ^ { w } \phi ( x ) \cdot \Phi ( a + b \cdot x ) \, \text { d } x \mbox { , } </m> where <m> ( a , \, b , \, w ) \in \mathbb { R } ^ 3 </m> and <m> b \neq 0 </m> , please . thanks a lot for your help .
the restriction of a continuous map <m> D ^ 2 \to S ^ 1 </m> to <m> \partial D ^ 2 \to S ^ 1 </m> must have degree zero . is that statement true or false if the map is only <m> W ^ { 1 , 2 } ( D ^ 2 ; S ^ 1 ) </m> and continuous on <m> \partial D ^ 2 </m> ? in two dimensions , the sobolev space <m> W ^ { 1 , 2 } </m> is at the borderline regularity and does not embed into the space of continuous functions . however , we can ask that a map 's values be on the circle almost everywhere , giving us the space <m> W ^ { 1 , 2 } ( D ^ 2 ; S ^ 1 ) </m> . such a map has a well-defined restriction to the boundary ; the restriction is a <m> W ^ { 1 / 2 , 2 } ( \partial D ^ 2 ; S ^ 1 ) </m> map . if it so happens that this restriction is continuous , we can ask about its degree . a standard example of a discontinuous <m> W ^ { 1 , 2 } </m> function is <m> f = \log ( \log ( 4 / r ) ) </m> , and we can use it to construct a discontinuous <m> W ^ { 1 , 2 } </m> circle-valued map <m> g = e ^ { i f } </m> . however , this map has degree zero on the boundary , and it 's not clear to me if one can do a different construction to get a degree one map . another good example to consider is <m> e ^ { i \theta } </m> , which is a <m> W ^ { 1 , p } ( D ^ 2 ; S ^ 1 ) </m> map for any <m> p < 2 </m> , and has degree one on the boundary .
let <m> S ^ { 2 n + 1 } </m> be the <m> m </m> - dimensional sphere in <m> \mathbb { C } ^ { n + 1 } </m> . endow <m> S ^ { 2 n + 1 } </m> with the standard metric . let <m> S ^ 1 </m> act by multiplication on <m> S ^ { 2 n + 1 } </m> . then <m> S ^ 1 </m> and the canonical action of <m> S U ( n + 1 ) </m> are by isometries . since the actions of <m> S ^ 1 </m> and <m> S ^ { 2 n + 1 } </m> commute , <m> G = S U ( n + 1 ) \times S ^ 1 </m> acts by isometries on <m> S ^ { 2 n + 1 } </m> . lifting the action to <m> T S ^ { 2 n + 1 } </m> we get , that this action is hamiltonian . in their paper `` new examples of manifolds with completely integrable geodesic flows '' , paternain and spatzier say , that <m> G </m> acts on <m> T S ^ { 2 n + 1 } </m> multiplicity-free/coisotropic . that means : 1 -RRB- their exists an <m> \operatorname { A d } ^ * _ G </m> - equivariant momentum map <m> \Phi \colon T S ^ { 2 n + 1 } \to \mathfrak { g } ^ * </m> 2 -RRB- for <m> \alpha \in \mathfrak { g } ^ * </m> the isotropygroup <m> G _ \alpha </m> acts transitively on the connected components of <m> \Phi ^ { - 1 } ( \alpha ) </m> . i 'm not sure how to show now , that this action is really multiplicity-free/coisotropic , because i do n't know how to calculate the momentum map and the preimage effectively .

this is related to my question here . my question is as follows . how do i see that a nonnegatively graded algebra <m> A </m> is finitely generated as a <m> k </m> - algebra if and only if <m> A _ 0 </m> is finitely generated as a <m> k </m> - algebra and <m> A _ { > 0 } </m> is finitely generated as an <m> A </m> - module -LRB- i.e. as a left ideal of <m> A </m> -RRB- ? our algebras here are associative , unital , and not necessarily commutative .

given a measurable space <m> ( \Omega , \mu ) </m> such that <m> L _ \infty ( \mu ) </m> is isomorphic to a dual space , <m> L _ \infty ( \mu ) </m> is an injective banach space . indeed , given a subspace <m> Y </m> of <m> X </m> and a norm-one operator <m> T : Y \to L _ \infty ( \mu ) </m> , considering a finite partition <m> P </m> of <m> \Omega </m> consisting of measurable subsets , by averaging we get a finite rank operator <m> T _ P : Y \to L _ \infty ( \mu ) </m> with <m> \| T _ P \| \leq 1 </m> that , by the hahn-banach theorem , can be extended to an operator <m> \hat T _ P : X \to L _ \infty ( \mu ) </m> with <m> \| \hat T _ P \| \leq 1 </m> . so we can define a norm-one extensión <m> \hat T : X \to L _ \infty ( \mu ) </m> of <m> T </m> by taking weak <m> ^ * </m> - limits . there are examples of <m> L _ \infty ( \mu ) </m> spaces which are not injective . see the comments after theorem 1.4 in johnson , kania and schechtman -LRB- 2015 -RRB- suppose that <m> L _ \infty ( \mu ) </m> is non-isomorphic to a dual space . is it posible for <m> L _ \infty ( \mu ) </m> to be injective ?
i have a curious question about an argument/hint given in following thread : https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3062986/irreducible-smooth-proper-one-dimensional-mathbbz-schemes the op asked if there an irreducible smooth proper one-dimensional <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - scheme that is not isomorphic to the projective line . in the answer ariyan javanpeykar showed that the generic fiber <m> C : = X _ { \mathbb { Q } } : = X \times _ { S p e c \mathbb { Z } } S p e c ( \mathbb { Q } ) </m> of the morphism <m> X \to S p e c ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> is a smooth proper geometrically connected curve of genus zero . it stays to show that this implies <m> C _ { \mathbb { Q } } = \mathbb { P } ^ 1 _ { \mathbb { Q } } </m> from what we can deduce <m> X = \mathbb { P } ^ 1 _ { \mathbb { Z } } </m> . according to the hint one have to use that the sets of <m> \mathbb { F } _ p </m> - valued points <m> X ( \mathbb { F } _ p ) </m> are non empty for all <m> p </m> . could anybody explain in what way this hint with non empty <m> X ( \mathbb { F } _ p ) </m> has to be used to acquire desired result ? my considerations base essensially on ravi vakhil 's https://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/0708-216/216class41.pdf using the `` curve to projective '' extension theorem -LRB- 2.1 ; p. 5 -RRB- and the embedding theorem for non singular curves -LRB- thm 0.2 ; p. 7 -RRB- : i think that for <m> C _ { \mathbb { Q } } = \mathbb { P } ^ 1 _ { \mathbb { Q } } </m> as well for <m> X = \mathbb { P } ^ 1 _ { \mathbb { Z } } </m> we have essential problem is to find `` comparing '' morphisms <m> f : C \to \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> ; the candidates for an isomorphism . firslty regarding <m> C _ { \mathbb { Q } } = \mathbb { P } ^ 1 _ { \mathbb { Q } } </m> : thm . 0.2 provides an open immersion <m> f : C _ { \mathbb { Q } } \to \mathbb { P } ^ 1 _ { \mathbb { Q } } </m> which is proper , so closed and since both irreducible , a homeomorphism . i think that i can use a genus argument -LRB- interpreting it as dimension of first cohomology of <m> C </m> -RRB- on the resulting sequnce of the induced morphisms between structure sheaves to verify that <m> f </m> is already an isomorphism of schemes . i think that similar combination of thms 0.2 and 2.1 would provide an immersion <m> g : X \to \mathbb { P } ^ 1 _ { \mathbb { Z } } </m> and the verification this this is an isomorphism on the level of structure sheaves should work similar as in case above using genus property on resulting sheaf cohomology . question : the point that i really curious about is what argument is meant by the observation that the <m> \mathbb { F } _ p </m> - valued points <m> X ( \mathbb { F } _ p ) </m> are n't empty ? how does it help here ? where does it flow in for the argumentation ?

so let us start with the `` simplest '' scheme over <m> S p e c ( \mathbf { Z } ) </m> namely <m> X _ 0 = S p e c ( \mathbf { Z } ) </m> . then the -LRB- reciprocal -RRB- weil zeta function of <m> X _ 0 </m> at a prime <m> p </m> is given by <m> Z _ p ( T ) = 1 - T </m> -LRB- a polynomial of degree <m> 1 </m> -RRB- . so the hasse-weil zeta function of <m> X _ 0 </m> is given by <m> L _ { X _ 0 } ( s ) : = \prod _ { p } Z _ p ( p ^ { - s } ) ^ { - 1 } = \zeta ( s ) . </m> now if one lets <m> \psi ( z ) = \sum _ { n \in \mathbf { Z } } e ^ { i \pi n ^ 2 z } </m> then <m> \psi ( z ) </m> is a modular form of weight <m> 1 / 2 </m> -LRB- over a suitable congruence group of <m> S L _ 2 ( \mathbf { Z } ) </m> -RRB- in the sense that <m> ( - i z ) ^ { - 1 / 2 } \psi ( - 1 / z ) = \psi ( z ) . \; \; \; \; ( * ) </m> a straight forward computation which uses the definition of the gamma function implies that <m> \tilde { L } _ { X _ 0 } ( s ) : = \int _ { 0 } ^ { \infty } ( \psi ( i t ) - 1 ) t ^ { s / 2 } \frac { d t } { t } = 2 \pi ^ { - s / 2 } \Gamma ( s / 2 ) \zeta ( s ) . </m> using the functional equation <m> ( * ) </m> one may deduce the meromorphic continuation and the functional equation of <m> \zeta ( s ) </m> -LRB- invariance of <m> \tilde { L } _ { X _ 0 } ( s ) </m> under <m> s \mapsto 1 - s </m> -RRB- . now let us take the scheme <m> X _ 1 = \mathbf { P } ^ 1 </m> over <m> S p e c ( \mathbf { Z } ) </m> . then the -LRB- reciprocal -RRB- weil zeta function of <m> X _ 1 </m> at a prime <m> p </m> is given by <m> Z _ p ( T ) = ( 1 - T ) ( 1 - p T ) = 1 - \sigma _ 1 ( p ) T + p T ^ 2 </m> -LRB- a polynomial of degree <m> 2 </m> -RRB- . it thus follows that the hasse-weil zeta function of <m> X _ 1 </m> is given by <m> L _ { X _ 1 } ( s ) = \prod _ { p } Z _ p ( p ^ { - s } ) ^ { - 1 } = \zeta ( s ) \zeta ( s - 1 ) . </m> now let us look at the eisenstein series of weight <m> 2 </m> i.e. <m> E _ 2 ( z ) = ( 2 \pi i ) ^ { - 2 } \sum _ { m , n } ' \frac { 1 } { ( m z + n ) ^ 2 } : = \frac { - B _ 2 } { 2 } + 2 \sum _ { n \geq 1 } \sigma _ 1 ( n ) q _ { z } ^ n , </m> where <m> q _ { z } = e ^ { 2 \pi i z } </m> . -LRB- note that i do n't get any convergence issue here since i take this <m> q </m> - expansion as the definition of <m> E _ 2 ( z ) </m> -RRB- . note that <m> E _ 2 ( z ) </m> is `` almost '' a moldular form of weight <m> 2 </m> -LRB- for the full congruence group <m> S L _ 2 ( \mathbf { Z } ) </m> -RRB- since <m> ( - z ) ^ { - 2 } E _ 2 ( - 1 / z ) = E _ 2 ( z ) - \frac { 1 } { 2 \pi i z } \; \; \; \; ( * * ) </m> a straight forward computation similar to the one before implies that <m> \tilde { L } _ { X _ 1 } ( s ) : = \int _ { 0 } ^ { \infty } ( E _ 2 ( i t ) + B _ 2 / 2 ) t ^ { s } \frac { d t } { t } = 2 ( 2 \pi ) ^ { - s } \Gamma ( s ) \zeta ( s ) \zeta ( s - 1 ) . </m> as before using <m> ( * * ) </m> one obtains the meromorphic continuation of <m> L _ { X _ 1 } ( s ) </m> and its functional equation -LRB- <m> \tilde { L } _ { X _ 1 } ( s ) = - \tilde { L } _ { X _ 1 } ( 2 - s ) </m> , note the appearance of the sign <m> - 1 </m> -RRB- . note that this could already be deduced from what we know from <m> L _ { X _ 0 } ( s ) </m> . now there is no reason to stop here . so let <m> X _ 2 = \mathbf { P } ^ 2 </m> over <m> S p e c ( \mathbf { Z } ) </m> . then the weil zeta function of <m> X _ 2 </m> at <m> p </m> is <m> Z _ p ( T ) = ( 1 - T ) ( 1 - p T ) ( 1 - p ^ 2 T ) </m> -LRB- a polynomial of degree <m> 3 </m> -RRB- . it thus follows that the hasse-weil zeta function of <m> X _ 2 </m> is given by <m> L _ { X _ 2 } ( s ) = \prod _ { p } Z _ p ( p ^ { - s } ) ^ { - 1 } = \zeta ( s ) \zeta ( s - 1 ) \zeta ( s - 2 ) = \sum _ { n \geq 1 } \frac { a _ n } { n ^ s } </m> q1 : is it reasonable to expect the formal <m> q </m> - expansion <m> f ( q _ z ) = \sum _ { n \geq 1 } a _ n q _ z ^ n </m> to be related in some direct way to an automorphic form w.r.t. a suitable congruence subgroup of <m> G L _ 3 ( \mathbf { Z } ) </m> ? q2 : what about <m> X _ n = \mathbf { P } ^ n </m> in general ? added : note that in the case of <m> X _ 0 </m> i 'm really looking at <m> \tilde { \zeta } ( s ) : = \zeta ( 2 s ) </m> which is an <m> L </m> - function of weight <m> 1 / 2 </m> in the sense that <m> \tilde { \zeta } ( s ) </m> is related to <m> \tilde { \zeta } ( 1 / 2 - s ) </m> which is in accordance with the fact that <m> \psi ( z ) </m> has weight <m> 1 / 2 </m> .
consider a generic nontrivial 3-cocycle <m> \omega _ 3 ^ G ( g _ 1 , g _ 2 , g _ 3 ) \in H ^ 3 ( G , U ( 1 ) ) </m> in the cohomology group of <m> G </m> with <m> U ( 1 ) = \mathbb { R } / \mathbb { Z } </m> coefficient . in otherwords , here the 3-cocycle <m> \omega _ 3 ^ G </m> is a complex <m> U ( 1 ) = \mathbb { R } / \mathbb { Z } </m> function with the norm <m> | \omega _ 3 ^ G | = 1 </m> but with a <m> U ( 1 ) </m> complex phase satisfying the cocycle condition . we like to ask how can we trivialize -LRB- or split -RRB- the 3-cocycle <m> \omega _ 3 ( g _ 1 , g _ 2 , g _ 3 ) </m> of <m> G </m> into 3-coboundary if we lift <m> G </m> into a larger group <m> J </m> , and given that we know the group homomorphism <m> r </m> : <m> J \overset { r } { \rightarrow } G , </m> so that <m> \omega _ 3 ^ J ( j _ 1 , j _ 2 , j _ 3 ) = \omega _ 3 ^ G ( r ( j _ 1 ) , r ( j _ 2 ) , r ( j _ 3 ) ) = \omega _ 3 ^ G ( g _ 1 , g _ 2 , g _ 3 ) \text { i s t r i v i a l i n } H ^ 3 ( J , U ( 1 ) ) . </m> namely <m> \omega _ 3 ^ G ( r ( j _ 1 ) , r ( j _ 2 ) , r ( j _ 3 ) ) </m> becomes a 3-coboundary in <m> H ^ 3 ( J , U ( 1 ) ) </m> for the cohomology group of <m> J </m> , but <m> \omega _ 3 ^ G ( g _ 1 , g _ 2 , g _ 3 ) </m> originally wass not a 3-coboundary but was a 3-cocycle for the cohomology group of <m> G </m> . namely , we can explicitly write <m> \omega _ 3 ^ G ( g _ 1 , g _ 2 , g _ 3 ) = \omega _ 3 ^ G ( r ( j _ 1 ) , r ( j _ 2 ) , r ( j _ 3 ) ) = \frac { \beta _ 2 ^ J ( j _ 2 , \; j _ 3 ) \beta _ 2 ^ J ( j _ 1 , \; j _ 2 \cdot j _ 3 ) } { \beta _ 2 ^ J ( j _ 1 \cdot j _ 2 , \; j _ 3 ) \beta _ 2 ^ J ( j _ 1 , \; j _ 2 ) } . </m> here <m> \beta _ 2 ^ J ( j _ 1 , \; j _ 2 ) </m> is a 2-cochain for <m> j _ 1 , j _ 2 , j _ 3 \in J </m> , and that <m> g _ 1 = r ( j _ 1 ) </m> , <m> g _ 2 = r ( j _ 2 ) </m> , <m> g _ 3 = r ( j _ 3 ) \in G </m> .
during my research i have recently stumbled upon the problem of finding the relative homotopy sets <m> \pi _ 1 ( U _ n , U _ n / O _ n ) </m> and <m> \pi _ 1 ( U _ { 2 n } , U _ { 2 n } / U S p _ { 2 n } ) </m> for <m> n </m> large enough to be in the stable regime where bott periodicity applies . the subgroup <m> U _ n / O _ n \subset U _ n </m> contains all elements <m> g \in U _ n </m> with <m> g = g ^ T </m> and the cartan embedding is <m>  </m> similarly , the subgroup <m> U _ { 2 n } / U S p _ { 2 n } \subset U _ { 2 n } </m> contains all elements <m> g \in U _ { 2 n } </m> with <m> g = J g ^ T J ^ { - 1 } </m> and the cartan embedding is <m>  </m> with <m> J : = \begin {pmatrix} 0 & 1 _ n \newline - 1 _ n & 0 \end {pmatrix} </m> . in order for my other results to be consistent , i expect the result to be <m>  </m> however , with the following argument i find that both are trivial : using the exact sequence of homotopy groups/sets , <m>  </m> where <m> i _ { 1 } </m> and <m> i _ 2 </m> are induced by the cartan embeddings above , there is the bijection <m> X = \pi _ 1 ( U _ n ) / \text { i m g } ( i _ 1 ) = \mathbb { Z } / \text { i m g } ( i _ 1 ) \, \ Y = \pi _ 1 ( U _ { 2 n } ) / \text { i m g } ( i _ 2 ) = \mathbb { Z } / \text { i m g } ( i _ 2 ) </m> since <m> \pi _ 0 ( U _ n / O _ n ) = \pi _ 0 ( U _ { 2 n } / U S p _ { 2 n } ) = 0 </m> . the determinant induces a bijection <m> \pi _ 1 ( U _ n ) \to \pi _ 1 ( U _ 1 ) = \mathbb { Z } </m> with inverse induced by <m> U _ 1 \hookrightarrow U _ n </m> -LRB- adding ones to the diagonal -RRB- , so a representative loop of the class <m> m \in \pi _ 1 ( U _ n ) = \mathbb { Z } </m> is <m> \phi : t \mapsto \text { d i a g } ( e ^ { i 2 \pi m t } , 1 , \dots , 1 ) . </m> this has a preimage under <m> i _ 1 </m> , namely the loop <m> \phi _ 1 : t \mapsto \text { d i a g } ( e ^ { i \pi m t } , 1 , \dots , 1 ) \cdot O _ n . </m> this is indeed a loop since <m> \phi _ 1 ( 0 ) = ( 1 , 1 , \dots , 1 ) \cdot O _ n </m> and <m> \phi _ 1 ( 1 ) = ( - 1 , 1 , \dots , 1 ) \cdot O _ n = ( 1 , 1 , \dots , 1 ) \cdot O _ n </m> . similarly , there is a preimage under <m> i _ 2 </m> , namely the loop <m> \phi _ 2 : t \mapsto \text { d i a g } ( e ^ { i \pi m t } , 1 , \dots , 1 ) \cdot U S p _ { 2 n } . </m> again , this is a loop since <m> \phi _ 2 ( 0 ) = ( 1 , 1 , \dots , 1 ) \cdot U S p _ { 2 n } </m> and <m> \phi _ 2 ( 1 ) = ( - 1 , 1 , \dots , 1 ) \cdot U S p _ { 2 n } = ( 1 , 1 , \dots , 1 ) \cdot U S p _ { 2 n } </m> . thus , both <m> i _ 1 </m> and <m> i _ 2 </m> are surjective and <m> X = Y = 0 </m> . however , for the expected result to hold , <m> i _ 1 </m> should be surjective in the sequence with <m> X </m> and <m> \text { i m g } ( i _ 2 ) = 2 \mathbb { Z } </m> -LRB- even integers only -RRB- in the sequence with <m> Y </m> . this does not seem to be the case - is my argument flawed or is it true that both relative homotopy sets are in fact trivial ? thank you !
let <m> K = P S L _ 2 ( q ) </m> where <m> q = p ^ a </m> for some odd prime <m> p </m> , and let <m> G </m> be a group such that <m> G / O ( G ) \cong K </m> . -LRB- here <m> O ( G ) </m> is the largest odd-order normal subgroup of <m> G </m> . -RRB- i have a homomorphism <m> \phi : G \to P G L _ n ( \overline { \mathbb { F } _ r } ) </m> whose image is non-solvable . -LRB- here <m> r </m> is a prime distinct from <m> p </m> . -RRB- i am interested in giving a lower bound for <m> n </m> . in the case where <m> O ( G ) </m> is trivial , a classical result originating with work of frobenius gives a sharp lower bound for <m> n </m> , namely <m> \frac 1 2 ( q - 1 ) </m> . -LRB- provided <m> q \neq 9 </m> , but let 's ignore this exception . -RRB- i 'd like to prove that this bound is best possible , i.e.
for any set <m> X </m> we define <m> [ X ] ^ 2 = \big \{ \{ a , b \} : a , b \in X \text { a n d } a \neq b \big \} </m> . let <m> E = \big \{ \{ ( a _ 1 , a _ 2 ) , ( b _ 1 , b _ 2 ) \} \in [ \omega \times \omega ] ^ 2 : | a _ i - b _ i | = 1 \text { f o r s o m e } i \in \{ 1 , 2 \} \big \} . </m> is there a topology <m> \tau </m> on <m> \omega \times \omega </m> such that <m> A \subseteq ( \omega \times \omega ) </m> is connected with respect to <m> \tau </m> if and only if <m> A </m> is a connected subgraph of <m> ( \omega \times \omega , E ) </m> ?
let <m> M </m> be a compact manifold and diff <m> ( M ) </m> its diffeomorphism group . let <m> G </m> be a lie subgroup of <m> G L ( n , \mathbb { R } ) </m> . in general , the topology of a manifold may prevent it from having an integrable <m> G </m> - structure . an easy example is <m> M = S ^ 2 </m> and <m> G = O ( 2 ) </m> . an integrable <m> O ( 2 ) </m> - structure is a flat riemannian metric . such a metric can not exist due to the gauss-bonnet theorem . so suppose that <m> M </m> has at least one integrable <m> G </m> - structure . call it <m> k </m> . is the set of all integrable <m> G </m> - structures on <m> M </m> the orbit of <m> k </m> under the action of diff <m> ( M ) </m> ?
suppose we have a multiset <m> M </m> of positive rational numbers . sum of <m> M </m> equals <m> 1 </m> . we 'll call this multiset <m> n </m> - distributable for some <m> n \in \mathbb { N } </m> , if there exists a partition <m> M _ 1 \sqcup . . . \sqcup M _ n </m> of the <m> M </m> such that the sum of each -LRB- multi -RRB- subset <m> X _ i </m> equals <m> \frac { 1 } { n } </m> . if the multiset is <m> n </m> - distributable and <m> m </m> - distributable for some <m> n , m \in \mathbb { N } </m> , we will call it <m> ( n , m ) </m> - distributable , and so on . the problem is to find for some fixed <m> a _ 1 , \ldots , a _ k \in \mathbb { N } </m> the minimal possible cardinality of a <m> ( a _ 1 , . . . , a _ k ) </m> - distributable multiset . real-world analogy . you are organizing a party . you know that the number of guests to attend your party can be anything from <m> a _ 1 , \ldots , a _ k \in \mathbb { N } </m> . in order to be prepared you cut the cake beforehand into smaller pieces , not necessarily of equal size . the requirement is that , no matter how many guests come , you will be able to give each of them some pieces of the cake without having to cut the cake any further so that everybody will get the same amount of cake . what is the minimum number of pieces of your cake you will have to cut it into ? the question . formulated like this , is it a solved problem ? if it 's not , what specific cases are discussed and where could we read about it ? if it is solved , well ... basically the same , what mathematical branch is it and where to read about it ? i tried to ask it on mse here : https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1381042/dividing-the-whole-into-a-minimal-amount-of-parts-to-equally-distribute-it-betwe . after that some other gentleman asked essentially the same question : https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1383406/minimum-cake-cutting-for-a-party . the latter even has a bounty which is running out , but noone seems to know the answer -LRB- or maybe we chose wrong tags -RRB- . i tried to dig into this problem by myself , but being an amateur , all i wind up with is a lot of specific made up terminology , some useless properties , couple of toy model cases solved and a constant feeling that i 'm trying to invent a bicycle . any insight would be greatly appreciated .
consider grzegorczyk 's concatenation theory <m> \operatorname { T C } </m> , a `` weak theory of words over the two letter alphabet <m> \Sigma = \{ a , b \} </m> '' -LRB- this from grzegorczyk and zdanowski 's paper undecidability and concatenation , pp.72-91 in andrzej mostowski and foundational studies , a. ehrenfeucht , v.w. marek , m. srebrny -LRB- eds . -RRB- -RRB- .
in the introductory sections to their paper `` a formulation of conjectures on <m> p </m> - adic zeta functions in non-commutative iwasawa theory , '' fukaya and kato describe an explicit construction of determinant functors on the category of finitely generated , projective modules over a ring . in doing so , they use the language of torsors -LRB- aka principal homogeneous spaces -RRB- and make the construction described below . my question is about the motivation for this simple construction , i have seen it refered to elsewhere as a `` pushout '' but i do n't see how to view it as such . any help is greatly appreciated !
are there nice characterizations/classifications of subgroups of the symmetric group <m> S _ n </m> whose centralizers -LRB- in <m> S _ n </m> -RRB- are of a particular type ? in particular , i 'm interested in the case where the centralizers are either trivial or a small cyclic group .
i am not an expert in elliptic curves at all , so my question may naive and/or obvious . let <m> E </m> be an -LRB- affine -RRB- elliptic curve defined over a finite -LRB- or perfect -RRB- field of characteristic <m> p </m> . since its module of derivations is free of rank one over its coordinate ring <m> R </m> , we can choose a generator -LRB- unique up to a constant -RRB- <m> \delta </m> , what i call the ` invariant derivative ' . in particular , <m> \delta ^ p </m> , being again a derivative , must be a multiple of <m> \delta </m> . my question is , when is <m> \delta ^ p </m> actually zero . i verified this for <m> j = 0 </m> and <m> j = 1 7 2 8 </m> , and it seems in either case , this exactly happens when <m> E </m> is supersingular , respectively when <m> p \equiv 2 \mod 3 </m> and <m> p \equiv 3 \mod 4 </m> , at least for some low values of <m> p \geq 5 </m> . is this the pattern in general ?
let <m> H = ( V , E ) </m> be a hypergraph . we call it <m> T _ 0 </m> if for all <m> x \neq y \in V </m> there is <m> e \in E </m> with <m> \{ x , y \} \not \subseteq E </m> and <m> \{ x , y \} \cap e \neq \emptyset </m> -LRB- i.e. , <m> e </m> contains exactly one of <m> x , y </m> -RRB- . if <m> H = ( V , E ) </m> is a <m> T _ 0 </m> - hypergraph , it is possible that <m> | E | < | V | </m> : let <m> V = \mathbb { R } </m> and let <m> E = \{ ( - \infty , q ) : q \in \mathbb { Q } \} </m> . question . is there a <m> T _ 0 </m> - hypergraph <m> H = ( V , E ) </m> such that <m> 2 ^ { | E | } < | V | </m> ?
let <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> be a complex semisimple lie algebra and let <m> G </m> be its adjoint group . if <m> x \in \mathfrak { g } ^ { r s } </m> is a regular semisimple element , is its orbit <m> G \cdot x = \{ \mathrm { A d } _ g x : g \in G \} </m> also equal to <m> \exp ( \mathfrak { g } ) \cdot x = \{ \mathrm { A d } _ { \exp ( y ) } x : y \in \mathfrak { g } \} ? </m>
if we assume that <m> \Bbb R ^ V \neq \Bbb R ^ L </m> , can we deduce that there is some <m> x \in \Bbb R ^ V </m> which is <m> L </m> - generic ? of course if <m> V </m> is a generic extension of <m> L </m> this is true , but if <m> V = L [ 0 ^ \# ] </m> this is also true -LRB- the existence of <m> 0 ^ \# </m> implies the existence of <m> L </m> - cohen generics -RRB- , but <m> 0 ^ \# </m> can not be added by forcing . so it is possible to have reals which are not generic over <m> L </m> , but their existence does imply that a generic exist . is this always the case , or is there a counterexample ? namely , can we have <m> V = L [ x ] </m> for some real number <m> x </m> such that no real number in <m> L [ x ] </m> is <m> L </m> - generic ? edit : as joel 's answer shows , we can generate a counterexample using class forcing over <m> L </m> . to avoid these , we might as well require that the universe is not a class-generic extension of some <m> W </m> for which <m> \Bbb R ^ W = \Bbb R ^ L </m> .
let <m> q = \prod P _ i ^ { k _ i } . </m> i have learned here that <m> \# \{ 1 \leq a \leq q - 1 | ( a , q ) = 1 , ( a + 1 , q ) = 1 \} = F ( q ) = \prod ( p _ i - 2 ) p i ^ { k _ i - 1 } = q \prod ( 1 - 2 / p _ i ) </m> here was the idea behind it : for any <m> p _ i </m> , there exists <m> p _ i - 2 </m> admissible reminders modulo <m> p _ i </m> -LRB- we exclude 0 and -1 -RRB- thus <m> ( p _ i - 2 ) p _ i ^ { k _ i - 1 } </m> reminders modulo <m> p _ i ^ { k _ i } </m> . we get <m> F ( q ) </m> by applying the chinese reminder theorem . i am now trying to find what would happen if instead of -LRB- a , q -RRB- = 1 and -LRB- a +1 , q -RRB- = 1 , we would have <m> ( a , q ) = 1 </m> and <m> ( a + 2 , q ) = 1 </m> ? -LRB- with <m> 1 \leq a + 2 \leq q </m> -RRB- i want to find : <m> \# \{ 1 \leq a \leq q - 2 | ( a , q ) = 1 , ( a + 2 , q ) = 1 \} </m> i dont know if we could apply the same principle . we would still have <m> ( p _ i - 2 ) </m> reminders modulo <m> p _ i </m> . i am not quite sure .
let <m> H </m> be some polish group and <m> X </m> some standard borel space . assume that <m> H </m> acts measurably on <m> X </m> , i.e. <m> ( h , x ) \mapsto h x </m> is borel . let <m> H _ 0 \subset H </m> and <m> A \subset X </m> be some borel sets . is it true that the set of all <m> x \in X </m> such that <m> H _ 0 x \subset A </m> is borel ? the following theorem of descriptive set theory is related to the question : if <m> A </m> is some borel subset of <m> P \times X </m> , with <m> P </m> a polish space and <m> X </m> a standard borel space , such that , for any <m> x \in X </m> , the <m> x </m> - fiber <m> A _ x = \{ p \in P ; ( p , x ) \in A \} </m> is a <m> K _ \sigma </m> -LRB- i.e. a countable union of compact sets -RRB- , then <m> \pi _ X ( A ) </m> is borel , with <m> \pi _ X : P \times X </m> the projection onto <m> X </m> .
i ask a question in math.stackexchange , but nobody answer it . so , i ask here . in cao and zhu 's paper about ricci flow , the <m> \mathcal { L } </m> - geodesic is defined as picture below.in fact , <m> \mathrm { R i c } ( X , \cdot ) </m> should be <m> g ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { R i c } ( X , \cdot ) </m> .
let <m> \text { D G A } ^ { - } </m> denote the category of non-positively graded differential graded algebras with differentials of degree <m> + 1 </m> . it is well-known that <m> \text { D G A } ^ { - } </m> has a model structure with
given a commutative , <m> \mathbb N </m> - graded ring , one can associate to it a scheme via the <m> P r o j </m> construction . what happens if one tries to copy this procedure but instead of <m> \mathbb N </m> with another indexing gadget -LRB- say commutative monoid -RRB- ? some thoughts about this : considering projective varieties is roughly the same as studying affine varieties equivariant under the multiplicative group . so i would guess that replacing <m> \mathbb N </m> by something else corresponds to replacing the multiplicative group by something else .
i have been trying to understand the meaning of the expression `` regular neighborhood '' in the context described below , but i 'm stuck : we have a collection of curves <m> c _ i </m> for <m> i = 1 , 2 , . . , n </m> embedded in the orientable genus - <m> g </m> surface with 2 boundary components <m> S _ { g , 2 } </m> satisfying :
let <m> \Omega = [ 0 , L ] \times [ 0 , 2 \pi ] </m> and split its boundary into <m> \Gamma _ d = \{ 0 , L \} \times [ 0 , 2 \pi ] </m> , <m> \Gamma ^ 1 _ p = [ 0 , L ] \times \{ 0 \} </m> , <m> \Gamma ^ 2 _ p = [ 0 , L ] \times \{ 2 \pi \} </m> . consider the following subspace of <m> H ^ 2 ( \Omega ) </m> <m> V = \left \{ v \in H ^ 2 ( \Omega ) \mid v | _ { \Gamma _ d } = \partial _ \nu v | _ { \Gamma _ d } = 0 \text { a n d } v | _ { \Gamma ^ 1 _ p } = v | _ { \Gamma ^ 2 _ p } , \partial _ \nu v | _ { \Gamma ^ 1 _ p } = - \partial _ \nu v | _ { \Gamma ^ 2 _ p } \right \} \text { , } </m> where <m> \nu </m> is the outer unit normal vector . i.e. , we have dirichlet boundary conditions on the left and right boundary and periodic boundary conditions on the upper and lower boundary . on <m> V </m> define the bilinear form <m> a ( u , v ) = \int _ { \Omega } ( \Delta u + u ) ( \Delta v + v ) \, \mathrm { d } x \text { . } </m> my question : is it true that <m> a ( u , u ) = \int _ { \Omega } ( \Delta u ) ^ 2 + 2 u \Delta u + u ^ 2 \, \mathrm { d } x </m> is coercive on <m> V </m> ? or , more specifically , can i find <m> c > 0 </m> such that <m> \Vert \Delta u \Vert _ { L ^ 2 ( \Omega ) } ^ 2 + \Vert u \Vert _ { L ^ 2 ( \Omega ) } ^ 2 \leq c \, a ( u , u ) </m> holds true for all <m> u \in V </m> ? i see how by using integration by parts , one may equivalently consider the energy <m> \int _ { \Omega } ( \Delta u ) ^ 2 - 2 \vert \nabla u \vert ^ 2 + u ^ 2 \, \mathrm { d } x \text { , } </m> but it is unclear to me how to go from there because i fail at controlling the <m> \nabla u </m> - term against the other two , at least for general lengths <m> L </m> .
suppose we look at all sets in <m> { [ n ] \choose k } </m> , for some <m> k \leq n / 2 </m> , and place them in layers according to the sum of their elements . then , we say that two sets <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> from consecutive layers are connected by an edge , if there is some <m> i \in [ n - 1 ] </m> for which <m> ( i , i + 1 ) A = B </m> . that is , if <m> A \Delta B = \{ i , i + 1 \} </m> . is it true that any two consecutive layers have a perfect matching , in the sense that all the elements of the layer with less sets are matched ? for instance , let 's take <m> n = 6 </m> , <m> k = 3 </m> . and let 's match the layer with sum <m> 1 2 </m> to the layer with sum <m> 1 1 </m> : <m> ( \{ 6 , 5 , 1 \} , \{ 6 , 4 , 1 \} ) , ( \{ 6 , 4 , 2 \} , \{ 6 , 3 , 2 \} ) , ( \{ 5 , 4 , 3 \} , \{ 5 , 4 , 2 \} ) </m> .
as odd squares are congruent to <m> 1 </m> modulo <m> 8 </m> , any integer of the form <m> 4 ^ k ( 8 m + 7 ) </m> with <m> k , m \in \mathbb N = \{ 0 , 1 , 2 , \ldots \} </m> can not be written as the sum of three squares . to avoid such congruence obstacles in representation problems , i suggest a variant of squares by using euler 's totient function <m> \varphi </m> . it is easy to see that all the numbers <m> \varphi ( n ^ 2 ) = n \varphi ( n ) \ \ ( n \in \mathbb Z ^ + = \{ 1 , 2 , 3 , \ldots \} ) </m> are pairwise distinct . question : can we write each <m> n \in \mathbb Z ^ + </m> as <m> x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 + \varphi ( z ^ 2 ) </m> with <m> x , y \in \mathbb N </m> and <m> z \in \mathbb Z ^ + </m> ? actually , on oct. 1 , 2015 , i even made the following stronger conjecture . conjecture . any integer <m> n > 1 </m> can be written as <m> x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 + \varphi ( z ^ 2 ) </m> , where <m> x , y \in \mathbb N </m> , <m> x \le y </m> , <m> z \in \mathbb Z ^ + </m> , and <m> y </m> or <m> z </m> is prime . for the number of ways to write <m> n </m> in this way , see http://oeis.org/a262311 . for example , <m> 1 3 </m> has a unique required representation : <m> 1 3 = 1 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 2 + \varphi ( 4 ^ 2 ) </m> with <m> 2 </m> prime , and <m> 9 4 4 1 5 </m> has a unique required representation : <m> 9 4 4 1 5 = 1 1 5 ^ 2 + 1 7 8 ^ 2 + \varphi ( 2 2 3 ^ 2 ) \ \ \text { w i t h } \ 2 2 3 \ \text { p r i m e } . </m> i have verified the conjecture for all <m> n = 2 , \ldots , 1 0 ^ 6 </m> . though the conjecture might be quite challenging , the weaker version in the question should be on the research level . any comments are welcome !
if <m> X </m> is a topological space then the rational cohomology of <m> X </m> carries a canonical <m> A _ \infty </m> structure -LRB- in fact <m> C _ \infty </m> -RRB- with differential <m> m _ 1 : H ^ \ast ( X ) \to H ^ { \ast + 1 } ( X ) </m> vanishing and product <m> m _ 2 : H ^ \ast ( X ) \otimes H ^ \ast ( X ) \to H ^ \ast ( X ) </m> coinciding with the cup product . if <m> X </m> is a closed manifold then its cohomology algebra satisfies poincare duality . this is a condition that refers only to the <m> m _ 2 </m> part of the <m> A _ \infty </m> structure . there are things more general than manifolds that satisfy rational poincare duality , such as rational homology manifolds . in general , a space that satisfies rational poincare duality is called \ emph -LCB- rational poincare duality space -RCB- . obviously , the statement that <m> X </m> is a rational poincare duality space places no additional restrictions on the <m> A _ \infty </m> structure beyond the condition on the product . question 1 can one construct from the higher multiplications obstructions for a rational poincare duality space to be rationally equivalent to a rational homology manifold , or a topological or smooth manifold ? here is a second and somewhat related question . poincare duality says that <m> H ^ \ast ( X ) </m> is self-dual -LRB- with an appropriate degree shift -RRB- . thus the adjoints of the higher multiplication maps make the cohomology into an <m> A _ \infty </m> coalgebra -LRB- with appropriate adjustment of the grading -RRB- . question 2 how does this <m> A _ \infty </m> coalgebra structure interact with the <m> A _ \infty </m> algebra structure on the cohomology ?
we need to find the total number of sequences <m> ( x _ 1 , \dots , x _ k ) </m> , <m> x _ 1 < \dots < x _ k </m> , <m> x _ i \in \{ 1 , \dots , N \} </m> , such that <m> x _ 1 + \dots + x _ { k - 1 } > x _ k </m> .
consider the finite collection <m> M ( N , n ) </m> of all <m> N \times N </m> matrices with exactly <m> n </m> entries per row equal to <m> 1 </m> and all other entries equal to zero <m> 0 </m> . by an <m> a \times b </m> submatrix of <m> M </m> we mean a matrix obtained from <m> M </m> by crossing out all but <m> a </m> rows and all but <m> b </m> columns . i am interested in the proportion of <m> M ( N ) </m> that that have no wide submatrix of all zeroes . by that i mean an <m> a \times b </m> submatrix with <m> a > b </m> and <m> a + b > N </m> . for example we forbid any row of all zeroes -LRB- but this can not happen by definition -RRB- . we also also forbid all the zero matrices with one corner in the top-left and another on the diagonal . we also forbid everything in between up to permuting rows and columns . the naieve approach is to divide up the collection of possible submatrices with <m> a + b = N + 1 </m> according to the value of <m> a </m> . by symmetry the chance of any two elements of the same class being all zeroes depends only on the class . compute the probability on a class-by-class-basis , then sum over each classes , then sum all the classes . this gives a crude upper bound to the question . i 'm wondering is a more sophisticated upper bound known ? i 'm currently looking in the combinatorics literature to see if this problem has been considered before . but not being familiar with the various sub-areas i do n't know what to look for . i 've found a lot of papers on forbidden submatrices but none where the ambient space of matrices is formed as with <m> M ( N , n ) </m> . usually the ambient space is just the space of all <m> ( 0 , 1 ) </m> submatrices . i also know the problem is equivalent to one in bipartite graphs -LRB- each matrix is the adjacency matrix of a unique bipartite graph -RRB- but i do n't even know what to call a bipartite graph <m> G = L \cup R </m> were each node in <m> L </m> has degree <m> n </m> . there are so-called biregular graphs where the degree over <m> L </m> is constant and the degree over <m> R </m> is some other constant -LRB- possibly the same -RRB- . but i 'm only interested in fixing the degree over one half , not both . i 'd appreciate if anyone could point me in the right direction to where similar problems have been considered before .
to follow up on my previous question , is the category of small <m> A _ \infty </m> categories even cocomplete ? looking for reference .
let 's assume <m> v , w , x _ i \in R ^ n </m> are unknown . can one compute dot product <m> \langle v , w \rangle </m> if one has just the numbers : <m> \langle v , x _ i \rangle </m> and <m> \langle w , x _ i \rangle </m> for <m> n </m> random vectors <m> x _ i </m> . if <m> x _ i = e _ i </m> it is quite simple : <m> \langle v , w \rangle = \sum _ i \langle v , e _ i \rangle \langle w , e _ i \rangle </m> but what if the <m> x _ i </m> is not an orthogonal basis ? if not possible can we do something with stronger assumptions like all vectors being unitary ?
fix an integer <m> n \ge 2 </m> . let <m> [ a , b ] </m> be an interval and <m> f : [ a , b ] \to \mathbb R </m> be a continuous function and for <m> x _ 1 , . . . , x _ n </m> being the gaussian quadrature nodes in <m> [ a , b ] </m> , and gaussian quadrature wights <m> w _ 1 , . . . , w _ n </m> in <m> [ a , b ] </m> , -LRB- everything being calculated with weight function <m> \omega ( x ) = 1 </m> -RRB- -LRB- see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaussian_quadrature for details -RRB- , let <m> T _ { n , [ a , b ] } ( f ) : = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n w _ i f ( x _ i ) </m> . now , for every <m> f \in C [ 0 , 1 ] </m> , let <m> T _ n ( f ) ( 0 ) = 0 </m> and <m> T _ n ( f ) ( x ) = T _ { n , [ 0 , x ] } ( f ) , \forall x \in ( 0 , 1 ] </m> . let <m> { \mathbb R } ^ { [ 0 , 1 ] } </m> be the set of all functions from <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> to <m> \mathbb R </m> . then of-course <m> T _ n </m> is a linear map from <m> C ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) </m> to <m> { \mathbb R } ^ { [ 0 , 1 ] } </m> . my questions are the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- for which <m> n </m> , is it true that <m> T _ n ( C [ 0 , 1 ] ) \subseteq C [ 0 , 1 ] </m> ? -LRB- 2 -RRB- let <m> \mathcal B ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) </m> be the set of all bounded real-valued functions on <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> . for which <m> n </m> , is it true that <m> T _ n ( C [ 0 , 1 ] ) \subseteq \mathcal B ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) </m> ? -LRB- 3 -RRB- for which <m> n </m> , is <m> T _ n </m> an injective function ? -LRB- 4 -RRB- if <m> n \ge 2 </m> is an integer for which <m> ( 2 ) </m> -LRB- or -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- holds , then is it true that <m> \sup _ { x \in [ 0 , 1 ] } | T _ n ( f ) ( x ) | \le M _ n \sup _ { x \in [ 0 , 1 ] } | f ( x ) | , \forall f \in C ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) </m> , where the constant <m> M _ n </m> only depends on <m> n </m> ? -LRB- 5 -RRB- is it true that <m> T _ n ( f ) \to T ( f ) , \forall f \in C [ 0 , 1 ] </m> ? or at least does a subsequence of <m> \{ T _ n \} </m> converge to <m> T </m> pointwise on <m> C [ 0 , 1 ] </m> ? where <m> T </m> is the operator <m> T : C [ 0 , 1 ] \to C [ 0 , 1 ] </m> , defined as <m> T ( f ) ( x ) : = \int _ 0 ^ x f ( t ) d t </m>
suppose we are given a small -LRB- enriched -RRB- category <m> C </m> , and for <m> a , b \in C </m> an isomorphism <m> m : a \to b </m> . it is always possible to find a functor <m> F : C \to C </m> , with <m> F ( a ) = b </m> and a natural transformation <m> N </m> of the identity functor to <m> F </m> so that <m> N _ a = m </m> . this is a nice simple exercise . can this always be done when <m> C </m> is an <m> A _ { \infty } </m> - category ? the intuition behind this is the following . given a path <m> m </m> from <m> a </m> to <m> b </m> in say a cw complex <m> X </m> , we can always find a homotopy <m> H : X \times [ 0 , 1 ] \to X </m> of the identity map so that <m> H | _ { \{ a \} \times [ 0 , 1 ] } = m </m> . the question can be generalized to ask when there is a `` homotopy extension property '' for <m> A _ { \infty } </m> subcategories . edit : for the first question the answer is affirmative by an abstract non-sense argument . take the <m> A _ { \infty } </m> yoneda embedding <m> Y </m> of c into ch-dg the category of chain complexes . then find the functor <m> F </m> and the natural transformation <m> N </m> for <m> Y ( m ) </m> inside y -LRB- c -RRB- which is a dg-category . then just pull-back both by y. however it maybe nice to find a more direct argument .
is the braid group with <m> n </m> strings <m> \mathcal { B } _ n </m> known to be a lattice in a connected semi-simple lie group ? -LRB- for <m> n </m> , say , bigger than <m> 3 </m> -RRB- or is it known that it can not be such a lattice ?
related to an open problem about another series . set <m> A = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { \psi ^ { ( 1 ) } ( 1 - n / \pi ) } { n ^ 3 } </m> where <m> \psi ^ { ( n ) } ( k ) </m> is the polygamma function .
let <m> G </m> be a compact lie group , and let <m> G ^ \mathbb { C } </m> be its complexification . i am looking for a symplectic structure -LRB- without use of coordinates -RRB- on <m> S y m ^ k G ^ { \mathbb { C } } , </m> ps : here <m> G ^ { \mathbb { C } } = T ^ * G </m> . -LRB- this equality is trivial by polar decomposition in the case , when <m> G </m> is compact lie group -RRB- i.e. on the space of all symmetric tensors of order <m> k </m> defined on <m> G ^ \mathbb { C } </m> .
let <m> X </m> be a rational threefold -LRB- over the field of complex numbers -RRB- with terminal singularities . it is well-known that <m> X </m> has only finitely many singular points <m> x _ 1 , x _ 2 , \ldots , x _ n </m> . to be more precise , i am especially interested in the case where there is a mori fibration <m> \phi : X \to \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> with general fiber isomorphic to <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 2 </m> . then over <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 \setminus \{ \phi ( x _ 1 ) , \ldots , \phi ( x _ n ) \} </m> this mori fibration is simply a <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 2 </m> - bundle . question : is there an explicit description of <m> X </m> locally around <m> x _ i </m> ? here by explicit i have in mind for instance a local description by equations or as a quotient group . at least i would like a description wich enables me to blow-up and blow-down and understand what i get , and also to have an idea on how degenerate the singular fibers can be . thank you in advance !
i am interested in airy 's equation <m> \frac { \partial u } { \partial t } ( t , x ) = - \frac { \partial ^ 3 u } { \partial x ^ 3 } ( t , x ) </m> on a bounded or semi-bounded domain , e.g. on <m> ( - \infty , 0 ) </m> . in order to obtain a group of isometries as propagator in <m> L ^ 2 ( - \infty , 0 ) </m> , two boundary conditions have to imposed - e.g. , <m> u ' ( 0 ) = 0 </m> and either <m> u ( 0 ) = 0 </m> or <m> u ' ' ( 0 ) = 0 </m> . but then it seems that the spectrum of the operator is far too large , so i doubt that this operator does not generate a semigroup in <m> L ^ 2 ( - \infty , 0 ) </m> at all , regardless of the imposed boundary conditions . is it so ? has anybody ever proved well-posedness of the above equation in some reasonable function or distribution space ?
it is well known that total space of the tautological line bundle <m> \mathcal { O } ( - 1 ) </m> over projective space <m> \mathbb { P } ^ n </m> is closed subvariety of <m> \mathbb { P } ^ n \times \mathbb { A } ^ { n + 1 } </m> . my question is how to realize total space of <m> \mathcal { O } ( 1 ) </m> over <m> \mathbb { P } ^ n </m> in such manner , i.e. i need an embedding of <m> T o t ( \mathcal { O } ( 1 ) ) </m> in simple variety and defining equations . thanks .
let <m> p </m> be a prime number , let <m> m </m> be a fixed number -LRB- for example <m> 2 ^ { 2 0 } </m> -RRB- , and <m> i = k ^ { - 1 } \cdot ( j - t ) \pmod { p } </m> where <m> j \leq m </m> and <m> m < k </m> . in the general case we have <m> t = 0 </m> , and <m> k , j </m> are variable and in special case <m> t </m> and <m> k </m> are fix and we know its values . is there a way to find the minimum value of <m> i </m> ? example : in special case , let <m> p = 7 </m> , <m> t = 3 </m> , <m> k = 3 </m> and <m> m = 2 </m> . if <m> j = 1 </m> then <m> i = 4 </m> and if <m> j = 2 </m> then <m> i = 2 </m> . so minimum value of <m> i </m> is <m> 2 </m> . in general case we can search all possible cases for <m> k , j </m> and then find the minimum value of <m> i </m> 's . if <m> m </m> be so large we cant search all possible <m> j </m> . so im looking for general method to solve this problem without searching .
let <m> X </m> be compact hausdorff topological space . consider the ring <m> C ( X ) </m> of continuous functions <m> X \rightarrow \mathbb C </m> -LRB- we do not consider the c * algebra structure , just consider <m> C ( X ) </m> as a ring -RRB- and its -LRB- purely algebraic -RRB- spectrum <m> \text { S p e c } ( C ( X ) ) </m> . there is a injective continuous map <m> X \rightarrow \text { S p e c } ( C ( X ) ) </m> sending <m> x </m> to the maximal ideal <m> \mathfrak m _ x = \{ f \in C ( X ) : f ( x ) = 0 \} </m> . under which conditions on <m> X </m> is this map surjective ? under which conditions is it a homeomorphism to its image ?
let <m> p </m> be a prime ; <m> \mathbb { F } _ { p } </m> is the field with <m> p </m> elements and <m> \mathbb { F } _ { p } [ t ] </m> the ring of polynomials in <m> t </m> over <m> \mathbb { F } _ { p } </m> .
consider an <m> m </m> - by - <m> n </m> matrix <m> A </m> with entries in a field <m> k </m> ; we can see <m> A </m> as a point in the affine space <m> \mathbb { A } ^ { m n } </m> . the rank of <m> A </m> will be <m> \leq r </m> -LRB- where <m> r < \min ( m , n ) </m> -RRB- if and only if every <m> ( r + 1 ) </m> - by - <m> ( r + 1 ) </m> minor of a is <m> 0 </m> . that tells us that the set of all such matrices <m> A </m> forms a variety <m> V </m> . moreover , by higher-dimensional bézout , we obtain a bound on the sum of the degrees of the components <m> V _ i </m> of <m> V </m> : it is at most <m> ( r + 1 ) ^ { k _ { r , m , n } } , </m> where <m> k _ { r , m , n } = \binom { n } { r + 1 } \binom { m } { r + 1 } </m> is the number of <m> ( r + 1 ) </m> - by - <m> ( r + 1 ) </m> minors . unfortunately , that 's quite a large upper bound . is there another way to characterize <m> V </m> , resulting in a better upper bound for <m> \sum _ i \deg ( V _ i ) </m> ?
we say that <m> f : \mathbb { R } \to \mathbb { R } </m> is of baire class <m> 1 </m> if it is a pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions . one can generalize the definition above by taking pointwise limit of each ` previous ' level -LRB- s -RRB- to obtain ` next ' level . more precisely ,
let <m> \{ e _ { n } ( x ) \} _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } </m> be orthnormal basis of hilbert space <m> L ^ 2 ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> . if <m> \{ e _ { n } ( x ) \} _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } \subset L ^ p ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> for some <m> p \geq 1 </m> , is the <m> \{ e _ { n } ( x ) \} _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } </m> schauder basis for <m> L ^ p ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> ? any reference ?
as the question in the title asks , does <m> \pi ( x ) \geq \mathrm { L i } ( x ) </m> imply that <m> \vartheta ( x ) \geq x </m> ? here <m> \pi ( x ) = \# \{ p \leq x \} </m> , <m> \vartheta ( x ) = \sum _ { p \leq x } \log p </m> and <m> \mathrm { L i } ( x ) = \int _ { 2 } ^ { x } \frac { d t } { \log t } </m> . alternatively , is there a number <m> x </m> such that <m> \pi ( x ) \geq \mathrm { L i } ( x ) </m> and <m> \vartheta ( x ) \leq x </m> , or a number <m> x </m> such that <m> \pi ( x ) \leq \mathrm { L i } ( x ) </m> and <m> \vartheta ( x ) \geq x </m> ?
let <m> A , B , C \in \mathbb { N } </m> be such that <m> \gcd ( A , B , C ) = 1 </m> . is it known if the equation <m> A x ^ n + B y ^ n = C z ^ n </m> has any non-trivial solutions <m> x , y , z \in \mathbb { N } </m> ? i know there are no such solutions if <m> A = B = C = 1 </m> , because this is fermat 's last theorem . i was just wondering if something similar was known when there are positive coefficients as well or not . thank you very much ! ps by non-trivial solutions i mean the solutions that do not arise from degenerate cases .
given <m> M </m> a finite von neumann algebra with trace <m> \tau </m> , <m> T \in M </m> invertible . the fuglede-kadison determinant is defined as <m> \Delta ( T ) = e ^ { \tau ( l o g | T | ) } </m> , where <m> | T | = ( T ^ * T ) ^ { \frac { 1 } { 2 } } </m> , and <m> \tau ( l o g | T | ) = \int _ { 0 } ^ { | | T | | } l o g ( t ) d \mu _ { | T | } ( t ) </m> , and the probability measure <m> \mu _ { | T | } </m> is defined on spectrum -LRB- | t | -RRB- by requiring <m> \int _ { s p e c ( | T | ) } f d \mu _ { | T | } = \tau ( f ( | T | ) ) </m> for all <m> f \in C ( s p e c ( | T | ) ) </m> . see the reference determinant theory in finite factors especially , let <m> M = L ( \mathbb { F } _ 2 ) </m> be the free group factor associated to the free group <m> \mathbb { F } _ 2 </m> on two generators <m> a , b </m> , and with the canonical trace <m> \tau </m> , my question is : 1 , are there any references for the study of the determinant in the case <m> M = L ( \mathbb { F } _ 2 ) </m> ? especially , i also want to know 2 , are there any nontrivial computable examples in this case , i.e. , what does <m> \Delta ( T ) </m> looks like for <m> T \in \mathbb { C } \Gamma </m> , invertiable ? note : this question is motivated by the paper li , 2012 .
what does it mean , from the geometrical point of view , use -LRB- in general relativity -RRB- of the constraints on the metric tensor 's coefficients such that <m> \Delta g _ { i j } = 0 </m> ? -LRB- where <m> \Delta </m> is the beltrami-laplace operator , <m> g _ { i j } </m> the metric tensor -RRB- . with <m> \Delta g _ { i j } = 0 </m> , i mean the laplace-beltrami operator , applied componentwise to the components of the metric tensor . thank you in advance !
let <m> I = \langle f _ 1 , \cdots , f _ m \rangle \subset K [ x _ 1 , \cdots , x _ n ] </m> be an ideal , where <m> f _ k \in K [ x _ 1 , \cdots , x _ n ] . </m> <m> K [ e _ 1 , \cdots , e _ n ] </m> the polynomial algebra generated by the elementary symmetric polynomials <m> e _ 1 , \cdots , e _ n \in K [ x _ 1 , \cdots , x _ n ] . </m> is there any method -LRB- algorithm -RRB- to compute the k-algebra <m> I \cap K [ e _ 1 , \cdots , e _ n ] </m> of the intersection of <m> I </m> and <m> K [ e _ 1 , \cdots , e _ n ] ? </m> since <m> K [ e _ 1 , \cdots , e _ n ] </m> is not an ideal of <m> K [ x _ 1 , \cdots , x _ n ] , </m> it fails to compute elimination ideal . anyway , <m> I \cap K [ e _ 1 , \cdots , e _ n ] </m> is an ideal of the ring <m> K [ e _ 1 , \cdots , e _ n ] . </m> what i want to do is to give the generating sets of this ideal by polynomials in <m> K [ e _ 1 , \cdots , e _ n ] . </m>
suppose <m> 0 ^ { \# } </m> exists . let <m> M ( L ) </m> be the generic multiverse over <m> L </m> as viewed in <m> V </m> , i.e. <m> M ( L ) </m> consists of all <m> L [ g ] </m> where <m> g \in V </m> is <m> \mathbb { P } </m> - generic over <m> L </m> for some forcing <m> \mathbb { P } \in L </m> . in a previous post we established that <m> M ( L ) </m> is not upward directed , i.e. there are <m> M , N \in M ( L ) </m> such that for all <m> K \in M ( L ) \colon M \cup N \not \subseteq K </m> . let us consider the following weakening : definition 1 . <m> M ( L ) </m> 's pointwise theory is reconcilable iff for all <m> M , N \in M ( L ) </m> there are <m> M ' , N ' \in M ( L ) </m> such that <m> M \subseteq M ' , N \subseteq N ' </m> and <m> \mathrm { T h } ( ( M ' ; \in ) ) = \mathrm { T h } ( ( N ' ; \in ) ) </m> . question 2 . is <m> M ( L ) </m> 's pointwise theory reconcilable ? again , there is an easy partial answer : proposition 3 . let <m> M _ { < \omega _ { 1 } } ( L ) </m> be the generic universe over <m> L </m> restricted to posets <m> \mathbb { P } </m> such that <m> V \models \mathrm { c a r d } ( \mathbb { P } ) < \omega _ 1 </m> . <m> M _ { < \omega _ { 1 } } ( L ) </m> 's pointwise theory is reconcilable . proof . let <m> \mathbb P , \mathbb Q \in L </m> be such that <m> V \models \mathrm { c a r d } ( \mathbb { P } ) , \mathrm { c a r d } ( \mathbb { Q } ) < \omega _ 1 . </m> let <m> g \in V </m> be <m> \mathbb { P } </m> - generic over <m> L </m> and let <m> h \in V </m> be <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> - generic over <m> L </m> . since <m> \omega _ 1 ^ V </m> is a limit of <m> L </m> - inaccessibles , we may fix some <m> L </m> - inaccessible <m> \kappa < \omega _ 1 ^ L </m> such that <m> \mathbb { P } , \mathbb { Q } \in \mathcal { J } _ \kappa </m> . since <m> \mathcal { J } _ { \kappa } </m> is countable in <m> V </m> , there are <m> g ' , h ' \in V </m> which are <m> \mathrm { C o l l } ( \omega , \kappa ) </m> - generic over <m> L </m> such that <m> L [ g ] \subseteq L [ g ' ] </m> and <m> L [ h ] \subseteq L [ h ' ] </m> . now recall that <m> \mathrm { C o l l } ( \omega , \kappa ) </m> is weakly homogeneous and thus <m> \mathrm { T h } ( ( L [ g ' ] ; \in ) ) = \mathrm { T h } ( ( L [ h ' ] ; \in ) ) </m> . q.e.d.
this question is out of plain curiosity . the first sentence of deligne 's les corps locaux de caractéristique <m> p </m> , limites de corps locaux de caractéristique <m> 0 </m> -LRB- 1984 -RRB- reads -LRB- in rough translation -RRB- as follows :
let <m> A </m> be a <m> * </m> - algebra , <m> E , </m> and <m> F </m> two <m> A </m> - modules , and a map <m> f : E \to F </m> such that <m> f ( a e ) = a ^ * f ( e ) , ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ a \in A . </m> this seems to me to be the natural generalisation of a conjugate linear map . however , it seems to be too restrictive . since for , <m> b </m> also in <m> A </m> , we must have <m> f ( a b e ) = a ^ * f ( b e ) = a ^ * b ^ * f ( e ) , </m> and <m> f ( a b e ) = ( a b ) ^ * f ( e ) = b ^ * a ^ * f ( e ) . </m> assuming that we have no zero multiplication , this implies that <m> a ^ * </m> and <m> b ^ * </m> commute , which means , since <m> * </m> is invertible , that every element of <m> A </m> commutes . is there something wrong with my reasoning here , or is my definition just too restrictive ?
i have a basic question about the definition of <m> D _ X </m> - algebras and schemes , which are defined in -LSB- bd2 -RSB- , chiral algebras . i have some understanding of connections on a vector bundle , but i am not sure about connections in different contexts . here <m> X </m> is a scheme , of course . question 1 : -LSB- bd2 -RSB- defines a <m> D _ X </m> algebra as a commutative unital <m> O _ X </m> algebra equipped with an integrable connection along <m> X </m> . what precisely does an `` integrable connection along x mean in this context ? question 2 : -LSB- bd2 -RSB- defines a <m> D _ X </m> scheme as a x-scheme equipped with an integrable connection along <m> X </m> . again , what does `` integrable connection along x '' mean in this context ?
let <m> S </m> be noetherian scheme and <m> ( S m / S ) _ { N i s } </m> is the nisnevich site of smooth schemes over <m> S </m> . the category of simplicial sheaves on <m> ( S m / S ) _ { N i s } </m> is denoted <m> S p c ( S ) </m> and this category has two model structures . one is the usual model structure of simplicial sheaves and another is the <m> \mathbb { A } ^ { 1 } </m> - model structure . i write <m> E x _ { \mathbb { A } ^ { 1 } } </m> for the <m> \mathbb { A } ^ { 1 } </m> - fibrant replacement functor . my question if <m> \mathscr { X } </m> and <m> \mathscr { Y } </m> are <m> \mathbb { A } ^ { 1 } </m> - fibrant objects -LRB- i.e. , <m> \mathbb { A } ^ { 1 } </m> - local objects -RRB- in <m> S p c ( S ) </m> and a morphism <m> f : \mathscr { Y } \longrightarrow \mathscr { X } </m> is a fibration of simplicial sheaves , then is <m> f </m> an <m> \mathbb { A } ^ { 1 } </m> - fibration ?
let <m> m \ge 1 </m> be an integer , let <m> k </m> be a field of characteristic <m> 0 </m> , and let <m> 1 \rightarrow \mathrm { G L } _ n \rightarrow E \rightarrow \mathbb { Z } / m \mathbb { Z } \rightarrow 1 </m> be an extension of <m> k </m> - group schemes . since <m> E </m> acts on <m> \mathrm { G L } _ n </m> by conjugation , there is an induced <m> k </m> - group scheme homomorphism <m> \mathbb { Z } / m \mathbb { Z } \rightarrow \mathrm { O u t } ( \mathrm { G L } _ n ) = \mathrm { A u t } ( \mathrm { G L } _ n ) / \mathrm { I n n } ( \mathrm { G L } _ n ) </m> . suppose that this homomorphism is trivial , i.e. , that the conjugation action of <m> E </m> on <m> \mathrm { G L } _ n </m> is by inner automorphisms . does this imply that the extension is split , i.e. , that <m> E \cong \mathrm { G L } _ n \times \mathbb { Z } / m \mathbb { Z } </m> compatibly with the extension structure ?
let <m> X </m> be a smooth projective variety with an action of <m> \mathbb { C } ^ { * } </m> . let us suppose that the set <m> X ^ { \mathbb { C } ^ { * } } </m> is finite . for <m> x \in X ^ { \mathbb { C } ^ { * } } </m> , let <m> A _ { x } </m> denote the attractor -LRB- under our <m> \mathbb { C } ^ { * } </m> - action -RRB- to <m> x </m> and let <m> R _ { x } </m> denote the repellent . take <m> x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } \in X ^ { \mathbb { C } ^ { * } } </m> . suppose that <m> x _ { 2 } \in \bar { A } _ { x _ { 1 } } </m> , where <m> \bar { A } _ { x _ { 1 } } </m> is the closure of <m> A _ { x _ { 1 } } </m> . is that true that <m> x _ { 1 } \in \bar { R } _ { x _ { 2 } } </m> ?
given any bijection <m> \varphi </m> between the irrationals and <m> \omega ^ \omega </m> , and a subset <m> A \subseteq \mathbb { R } \smallsetminus \mathbb { Q } </m> of size <m> \mathfrak { d } </m> , under which properties <m> \varphi ( A ) </m> is dominating ? what about the question in the title ? i guess we should assume <m> \mathfrak { d } < \mathfrak { c } </m> .
let <m> \mathcal { H } </m> be a grothendieck <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - topos . according to this page in nlab , for any <m> X \in \mathcal { H } </m> , the suspension object <m> \Sigma X </m> is homotopy equivalent to the smash product <m> B \mathbb { Z } \wedge X </m> , where <m> B \mathbb { Z } </m> is the `` classifying space of the discrete group of integers . '' furthermore , for any pointed object <m> X \in \mathcal { H } _ * </m> and any group object <m> G \in G r p ( \mathcal { H } ) </m> , the article says we can `` form the tensor product <m> X \otimes G \in G r p ( \mathcal { H } ) </m> . '' my problem is : none of this terminology is explained , nor does the page provide a reference . specifically , what is <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> in an arbitrary <m> \infty </m> - topos ? what is the smash product <m> \wedge </m> ? what is the tensor product <m> \otimes </m> ? my best guess is that <m> \otimes </m> refers to the unique tensor structure on <m> \mathcal { H } _ * </m> such that the map <m> \mathcal { H } \to \mathcal { H } _ * </m> is symmetric monoidal -LRB- here <m> \mathcal { H } </m> is given the cartesian monoidal structure -RRB- , but this is only a guess . is there a reference where all these notions are defined ?
given a funtion <m> f \in L ^ p ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) </m> -LRB- take <m> p = \infty </m> if you 'd like -RRB- , and also a measure preserving map <m> s : [ 0 , 1 ] \to [ 0 , 1 ] </m> -LRB- meaning <m> s </m> pushes lebesgue measure forward to itself -RRB- i would like to know if there exists some <m> f ^ { \ast } \in L ^ p ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) </m> such that <m> f ^ { \ast } \circ s = f </m> . if <m> s </m> is invertible this is of course obvious but measure preserving maps need not be invertible -LRB- although must be onto -RRB- . recall that given <m> f </m> there exists a monotone rearrangement of <m> f </m> , and a measure preserving map <m> t : [ 0 , 1 ] \to [ 0 , 1 ] </m> which yields this rearrangement . however my question is in some sense the reverse question -LRB- with no monotonicity added -RRB- . somehow it seems intuitive that such a map should exist but i 'm not able to prove it directly . it seems like something which may be well known however .
let <m> L </m> be a lattice associate to the dykin matrix of type <m> E _ { 8 } </m> . i would like to understand involutions of <m> L </m> and their invariant <m> L ^ { + } </m> and coinvariant lattice <m> L ^ - </m> -LRB- i think they are isomorphic -RRB- . i am sure that this has been studied in some literature . i would appreciate it if anyone could let me know the classification or some reference . any comments are welcome .
inscribed square problem wants that we know `` does every jordan curve admit an inscribed square ? '' from my amateur viewpoint it seems that the concept of jordan curve can be straightforwardly generalized to <m> \mathbb R ^ n </m> so as to define those curves so that they are images of continuous functions <m> f </m> from <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> to <m> \mathbb R ^ n </m> in such a way that those functions are injective on <m> [ 0 , 1 ) </m> and <m> f ( 0 ) = f ( 1 ) </m> on wikipedia , it is written : '' it is known that for any triangle t and jordan curve c , there is a triangle similar to t and inscribed in c. -LSB- 9 -RSB- -LSB- 10 -RSB- moreover , the set of the vertices of such triangles is dense in c. -LSB- 11 -RSB- in particular , there is always an inscribed equilateral triangle '' but , i do not have an access to articles -LSB- 9 -RSB- , -LSB- 10 -RSB- , -LSB- 11 -RSB- so do not know do they only discuss jordan curves in the plane . i would just like to know is it known :
i am asking for a reference request/proof sketch for the result of steel that characterizes <m> L [ T _ { 2 n + 1 } ] </m> as a direct limit of mice . given that both <m> L [ T _ { 2 n + 1 } ] </m> and <m> M _ { 2 n } </m> have a <m> \Sigma _ { 2 n + 2 } </m> well-ordering of the reals , i think the result should be that <m> L [ T _ { 2 n + 1 } ] </m> is the direct limit of iterable mice with <m> 2 n </m> woodin cardinals , but i am not sure . i 'm starting to think that this result is not written up , in which case a proof sketch would be appreciated . thank you for your help ! cody
let <m> g , n </m> be positive integers , is there a reference that <m> \mathrm { S p } ( 2 g , \mathbb { Z } ) \to \mathrm { S p } ( 2 g , \mathbb { Z } / n \mathbb { Z } ) </m> is surjection ? the only reference i could find is lemma 5.16 in deligne -- mumford , but to be honest , i do n't quite understand the argument : why is the reduction map surjective on unipotent elements ? deligne and mumford - the irreducibility of the space of curves of given genus
it is well-known that non-weakly compact operators from <m> \ell _ \infty </m> into any banach space act as isomorphisms on some subspace of <m> \ell _ \infty </m> isomorphic to <m> \ell _ \infty </m> . i have a question in this spirit . suppose that <m> T \colon \ell _ \infty \to c _ 0 </m> is a bounded linear operator . then <m> T </m> is not weakly compact . can it happen that <m> T | _ { c _ 0 } \colon c _ 0 \to c _ 0 </m> is weakly compact ?
let <m> G </m> be a compact group which act on a hilbert space <m> H </m> . we define a linear map <m> T </m> on the dual space <m> H ^ { * } </m> with <m> T ( \phi ) ( x ) = \int _ { G } \phi ( g . x ) </m> the integration is based on the haar measure . since <m> H ^ { * } </m> is isomorphic to <m> H </m> we actually have a linear operator on <m> H </m> . we denote this operastor with <m> T </m> , again . so <m> T \in B ( H ) </m> . we consider the <m> C ^ { * } </m> algebra generated by <m> T </m> . it is a subalgebra of <m> B ( H ) </m> . then we consider the direct sum -LRB- over all possible -LRB- non equivalent -RRB- irreducible representation of <m> G </m> -RRB- of all <m> C ^ { * } </m> algebras which we obtain in this processes . does this <m> C ^ { * } </m> algebra have a name -LRB- and studied already -RRB- ? does it contain some information about <m> G </m> ? is it a useful <m> C ^ { * } </m> algebra to study ?
suppose you have two <m> A _ \infty </m> - functors <m> \mathcal { F , G } : \mathcal { A } \longrightarrow \mathcal { B } </m> which descend to <m> F , G : A \longrightarrow B </m> in homology -LRB- here <m> A = H ^ 0 ( \mathcal { A } ) </m> and same for <m> \mathcal { B } </m> -RRB- and suppose there is a natural transformation <m> T : F \longrightarrow G </m> . is it always possible to lift <m> T </m> to a natural transformation <m> \mathcal { T } : \mathcal { F } \longrightarrow \mathcal { G } </m> ? another version of the same question i care about is if for every <m> X \in o b ( \mathcal { A } ) </m> i have a morphism <m> t ^ 0 _ X \in h o m _ \mathcal { B } ( \mathcal { F } ( X ) , \mathcal { G } ( X ) ) </m> such that in homology the classes represented by <m> t _ X ^ 0 </m> defines a natural transformation <m> [ t ] : F \longrightarrow G </m> , when is there a natural transformation <m> \mathcal { T } : \mathcal { F } \longrightarrow \mathcal { G } </m> such that <m> [ \mathcal { T } ] = [ t ] </m> ? what i need is an explicit construction , not just existence .

is the mapping <m> f : \mathbb { R } \rightarrow [ 0 , 1 ] , \ x \mapsto \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \frac { \lfloor x ^ n \rfloor \mod 2 } { 2 ^ n } </m> surjective ?
let <m> k </m> be an even number . for a <m> k </m> - dimensional cube -LRB- http://mathworld.wolfram.com/hypercubegraph.html -RRB- <m> Q _ k </m> , let <m> G </m> be a subgraph of <m> Q _ k </m> with <m> 2 ^ { k - 1 } + s </m> vertices , for <m> 1 \le s \le 2 ^ { k - 1 } - 1 </m> . i am wondering what is maximum number of edges <m> G </m> can have ? a theorem says average degree of <m> G </m> is at most <m> v _ G \log _ 2 v _ G </m> , so the number of edges of <m> G </m> is at most <m> \lfloor \frac { v _ G \log _ 2 v _ G } { 2 } \rfloor </m> . but is this the best bound ? for example when <m> s = 1 </m> , in my mind , to maximize the number of edges on <m> 2 ^ { k - 1 } + 1 </m> vertices , it should contains a <m> ( k - 1 ) </m> - dim subcube , say <m> \{ ( x _ 1 , \dots , x _ { n - 1 } , 0 ) : x _ i \in \{ 0 , 1 \} \} </m> . but then the remaining vertex <m> ( y _ 1 , \dots , y _ { n - 1 } , 1 ) </m> can have only one edge with the subcube . so this <m> G </m> has only <m> ( k - 1 ) 2 ^ { k - 2 } + 1 </m> edges . but for even <m> k </m> , <m> \lfloor \frac { v _ G \log _ 2 v _ G } { 2 } \rfloor = \lfloor \frac { ( 2 ^ { k - 1 } + 1 ) \log _ 2 ( 2 ^ { k - 1 } + 1 ) } { 2 } \rfloor \ge \lfloor \frac { ( 2 ^ { k - 1 } + 1 ) ( k - 1 ) } { 2 } \rfloor = \frac { ( 2 ^ { k - 1 } + 1 ) ( k - 1 ) - 1 } { 2 } = ( k - 1 ) 2 ^ { k - 2 } + \frac { k - 2 } { 2 } , </m> which is much larger than <m> ( k - 1 ) 2 ^ { k - 2 } + 1 </m> when <m> k </m> is large . therefore i am asking when <m> k </m> is even and <m> 2 ^ { k - 1 } + 1 \le v _ G \le 2 ^ { k - 1 } + 2 ^ { k - 1 } - 1 </m> , is the bound <m> \lfloor \frac { v _ G \log _ 2 v _ G } { 2 } \rfloor </m> tight , or is there any other better result ?
let us consider the basic linear elliptic pde <m> \mathrm { d i v } ( A \, \mathrm { g r a d } \, u ) + b u = f , </m> with <m> f \in L ^ p , </m> <m> A , b </m> uniformly bounded . do we have , for a weak solution <m> u \in W ^ { 1 , p } ( \Omega ' ) </m> , <m> ( A \, \mathrm { g r a d } \, u ) \in ( W ^ { 1 , p } ) ^ d ( \Omega ) , \ \mbox { i n } \Omega \subset \subset \Omega ' \subset \mathbb { R } ^ d ? </m> or at least do we have <m> \mathbf { n } \cdot ( A \, \mathrm { g r a d } \, u ) \in L ^ { p } ( \partial \Omega ) ? </m> this seems to me true at least if <m> A </m> is piecewise lipschitz uniformly because across an interface where <m> A </m> has a jump , the transmission condition <m> A \, \mathrm { g r a d } \, u </m> still has matched traces . my final goal is to know under what least conditions , we have green 's representation formula in the sense of lebesgue integrals : <m> u ( \mathbf { y } ) = \int _ { \partial \Omega } \frac { \partial G ( \cdot , \mathbf { y } ) } { \partial \mathbf { n } _ A } u - \frac { \partial u } { \partial \mathbf { n } _ A } G ( \cdot , \mathbf { y } ) ~ d S ( \mathbf { x } ) + \int _ { \Omega } f G ( \cdot , \mathbf { y } ) ~ d \mathbf { x } , </m> for <m> \mathbf { y } \in \Omega </m> and <m> \frac { \partial v } { \partial \mathbf { n } _ A } = \mathbf { n } \cdot ( A \, \mathrm { g r a d } \, v ) . </m> edit : i 'm still waiting a counter-example to the above guess when <m> A </m> is bounded only .
i believe there are only finitely many congruence subgroups <m> \Gamma \le S L _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> such that the compactification of <m> \mathcal { H } / \Gamma </m> is genus 1 . is there somewhere i can find a list of these genus 1 modular curves and look at their <m> j </m> - invariants -LRB- and ideally also reduction types over their field of definition -RRB- . here , i 'm referring to the moduli-theoretic model of the elliptic curve , which is necessarily a quotient of some <m> X ( n ) </m> -LRB- which is defined over <m> \mathbb { Q } ( \zeta _ n ) </m> -RRB- and hence the <m> j </m> - invariant will lie in <m> \mathbb { Q } ( \zeta _ n ) </m> . in particular i 'm interested in whether or not you can say anything about the integrality of the <m> j </m> - invariants of these genus 1 modular curves , especially in the case when the congruence subgroup is torsion-free . for example , are the <m> j </m> - invariants all integral ? do they all have additive/multiplicative reduction ? do they have cm ?

strongly inaccessible cardinals are usually introduced either as -LRB- a -RRB- cardinalities of models of zfc or -LRB- b -RRB- cardinals which are not the power set of a smaller cardinal nor the supremum of a set with hereditarily lesser cardinality . these seem to represent the model-theoretic and set-theoretic perspectives on strong inaccessibility . recently i learned that if <m> \kappa </m> is a strongly inaccessible cardinal , then <m> ( V _ \kappa ) ^ 2 \subseteq V _ \kappa </m> , so any function <m> f : V _ \kappa \to V _ \kappa </m> is a set of pairs whose coordinates are members of <m> V _ \kappa </m> , and so any such function can be `` applied '' to any other such function : <m> f ( g ) = \{ \ z \ | \ \langle \langle x , y \rangle , z \rangle \in f \ \& \ \langle x , y \rangle \in g \ \} </m> therefore one can say that if <m> \kappa </m> is strongly inaccessible , then <m> V _ \kappa </m> is closed under self-application -LRB- as defined above -RRB- of functions <m> f : V _ \kappa \to V _ \kappa </m> . this seems to be sort of a `` recursion-theoretic '' characterization of strong inaccessibility : it identifies a definable operation under which all strongly inaccessible cardinals are closed . question 0 : does this make sense ? question 1 : is the converse true , making this a complete characterization ? -LRB- if <m> V _ \kappa </m> closed under self-application of functions then <m> \kappa </m> is strongly inaccessible -RRB- ? question 2 : if so , i 'm sure this has come up before in the literature . in what sorts of directions does this investigation lead ? this is one of the more-vague questions i 've asked so far . i guess i 'm sort of fishing for enlightenment here ; it took me a long time to understand the point of inaccessibility , and i suspect that i might have caught on more quickly if this motivation -LRB- closure under self-application -RRB- had been introduced early on .
let <m> p </m> be an odd prime . does the equation <m> 2 ^ x - 3 p ^ y = 5 </m> only have finitely many solutions in positive integers <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> ?
it is well known that the fourier transform <m> \mathcal { F } </m> maps <m> L ^ 1 ( \mathbb { R } ^ d ) </m> into , but not onto , <m> \overline { C _ 0 ^ 0 } ( \mathbb { R } ^ d ) </m> , where the closure is taken in the <m> L ^ \infty </m> norm . this is a consequence of the open mapping theorem , for instance . my question is : what 's an explicit example of a function in <m> \overline { C _ 0 ^ 0 } ( \mathbb { R } ^ d ) </m> which is not in the image of <m> L ^ 1 ( \mathbb { R } ^ d ) </m> under the fourier transform ? i would also like to know whether there is a useful characterization of <m> \mathcal { F } ( L ^ 1 ( \mathbb { R } ^ d ) ) </m> . remark : it is easy to see that the banach space <m> \overline { C _ 0 ^ 0 } ( \mathbb { R } ^ d ) </m> consists of all continuous functions <m> f </m> on <m> \mathbb { R } ^ d </m> such that <m> f ( \xi ) \rightarrow 0 </m> as <m> | \xi | \rightarrow \infty </m> .
i would like to have an explicit upper bound -LRB- that is , one with explicit constants -RRB- for a possible real zero <m> \beta </m> for <m> L ( 1 , \chi ) </m> for real dirichlet characters <m> \chi </m> . i need such a bound for real characters <m> \chi </m> to any modulus , not just prime modulus . -LRB- ford/luca/moree , lemma 3 provides such a bound when the modulus is prime , of the form <m> \beta \le 1 - \frac { 2 5 \pi } { 4 \sqrt q \log ^ 2 q } </m> when <m> q </m> is a large prime ; i expect that the general result i 'm seeking would be of similar quality . -RRB- essentially equivalently , i would like a lower bound for <m> | L ( 1 , \chi ) | </m> for such characters <m> \chi </m> . -LRB- the proof of ford/luca/moree proceeds in this way , and bounds <m> | L ( 1 , \chi ) | </m> using dirichlet 's class number formula . -RRB- i would be happy with either an argument laid out here -LRB- the more complete , the better -RRB- or a reference to the literature .
from chang and keisler 's `` model theory '' , section 7.2 , we know that : 1 -RRB- there is a sentence <m> \sigma </m> in a suitable language <m> L </m> such that for all infinite cardinals <m> \alpha </m> , <m> \sigma </m> admits <m> ( \alpha ^ + , \alpha ) </m> iff there exists a tree <m> T </m> of height <m> \alpha ^ + </m> , with at most <m> \alpha </m> elements at each level <m> \xi < \alpha ^ + </m> , and with no branch of length <m> \alpha ^ + </m> . 2 -RRB- there is a sentence <m> \sigma </m> in a suitable language <m> L </m> such that for all infinite cardinals <m> \alpha </m> , <m> \sigma </m> admits <m> ( \alpha ^ { + + } , \alpha ) </m> iff there is a -LRB- kurepa -RRB- family <m> F </m> of subsets of <m> \alpha ^ + </m> such that <m> | F | = \alpha ^ { + + } </m> and for every <m> \xi < \alpha ^ + </m> , <m> | \{ X \cap \xi | X \in F \} | = \alpha . </m> my question : are there any `` natural '' statements that would be equivalent to a sentence <m> \sigma </m> admitting <m> ( \alpha ^ { + n } , \alpha ) </m> , <m> 3 \le n < \omega </m> ? for chang and keisler , <m> \sigma </m> has to be first-order . for our purposes , even <m> L _ { \omega _ 1 , \omega } </m> is good enough . addition : definition a sentence <m>  </m> in a language with a unary predicate <m> P </m> admits <m> ( , ) </m> , if <m>  </m> has a model <m> M </m> such that <m> | M | = </m> and <m> | P ^ M | = </m> . of course , λ ≤ κ . so , not only we need a model of a specific size , but we need the predicate p to have a specific size too .
working on a problem in differential geometry , which is quite far away from my area of expertise , i was recently led to consider the class of those smooth , <m> n </m> - dimensional embedded submanifolds <m> M \subset \mathbb { R } ^ N </m> such that the following condition is satisfied :
q1 : here , on pg <m> 1 0 3 </m> , the stack <m> \text { L o c S y s } _ G ( X ) </m> is defined -LRB- for an affine algebraic group <m> G </m> , a fixed dg scheme <m> X </m> , and a test scheme <m> S \in \textbf { D G S c h } </m> -RRB- : <m> M a p s ( S , L o c S y s _ G ( X ) ) : = \text { M a p s } ( S \times X _ { d R } , \text { p t } / G ) </m> here <m> X _ { d R } </m> is defined in pg <m> 1 2 </m> -LRB- see also the end of pg <m> 3 </m> -RRB- of this paper via : <m> \text { M a p s } ( S , X _ { d R } ) = \text { M a p s } ( ( \pi _ 0 ( S ) ^ { r e d } ) , X ) </m> , where <m> \pi _ 0 ( S ) </m> is the reduced version of the classical scheme <m> \pi _ 0 ( S ) </m> corresponding to the <m> D G </m> scheme <m> S </m> . with this definition , how can we recover the `` classical '' stack <m> \text { L o c S y s } _ { G } ( X ) </m> ? the `` classical '' stack is given by defining <m> \text { H o m } ( S , \text { L o c S y s } _ G ( X ) ) </m> to be the groupoid of <m> G </m> - bundles on <m> S \times X </m> with a flat connection along x. in the paper , it is stated on pg <m> 1 0 3 </m> that we can recover the classical stack from lemma <m> 1 0 . 1 . 3 </m> ; but i do n't understand how . q2 : i was wondering what references are best to learn about dg -LRB- differential graded -RRB- schemes ? also , are there any good references for <m> \infty </m> - groupoids ? the reason i 'm asking is that i 've been trying to learn the definition given here of a pre-stack as a contravariant functor <m> \textbf { D G S c h } \rightarrow \infty - \textbf { G r p d } </m> , and why it is a more suitable notion than the ordinary definition of a pre-stack as a contravariant functor <m> \textbf { S c h } \rightarrow \textbf { G r p d } </m> .
consider the category cat as a concrete category over set <m> \times </m> set via the functor u : cat <m> \rightarrow </m> set <m> \times </m> set , defined by u <m> ( \mathbf A \xrightarrow { F } \mathbf B ) = ( </m> ob <m> ( \mathbf A ) \xrightarrow { F _ O } </m> ob <m> ( \mathbf B ) </m> , mor <m> ( \mathbf A ) \xrightarrow { F _ M } </m> mor <m> ( \mathbf B ) ) </m> , where <m> F _ O </m> is the restriction of <m> F </m> to objects and <m> F _ M </m> is its restrictions to morphisms . cat is the category of all small categories in the sense that their objects and morphisms form sets -LRB- not classes -RRB- . it is clear that this concrete category is transportable . but is this category uniquely transportable ?
i 've been learning about p-adic hodge theory recently -LRB- i 'm a beginner -RRB- , and i 've been wondering about the following question the past couple of weeks . sorry for the long setup , it 's mainly background ; the question is down towards the bottom . background : for a field <m> k </m> , and a second field <m> K </m> of characteristic 0 , we can consider the <m> K </m> - linear category <m> M o t ( k ) _ { K } </m> of motives defined by smooth projective varieties over <m> k </m> -LRB- pure motives -RRB- up to homological or numerical equivalence -LRB- let 's assume homological equivalence equals numerical equivalence for each weil cohomology we consider -RRB- . then this is a semi-simple abelian category -LRB- due to jannsen -RRB- , and there are realization functors to various categories of vector spaces extending the functor sending a variety <m> X </m> to its cohomology groups -LRB- e.g. its etale cohomology groups <m> H ^ i ( X , \mathbb { Q } _ \ell ) </m> for <m> \ell \not = p </m> in which case <m> K = \mathbb { Q } _ \ell </m> -RRB- . in the case when <m> k = \mathbb { C } </m> and we take <m> K = \mathbb { Q } </m> , we can consider the singular cohomology realization <m> M o t ( \mathbb { C } ) _ \mathbb { Q } \rightarrow { V e c t } _ { \mathbb { Q } } </m> sending <m> X </m> to <m> H _ { s i n g } ^ * ( X , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> . one way of stating the hodge conjecture is that when we consider the extra structure of the hodge decomposition on <m> H ^ * _ { s i n g } ( X , \mathbb { Q } ) \otimes \mathbb { C } </m> and therefore consider the enriched realization <m> M o t ( \mathbb { C } ) _ { \mathbb { Q } } \rightarrow { H d g e } _ { \mathbb { Q } } </m> to pure <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> - hodge structures , this functor is fully faithful . similarly , if <m> k </m> is a finite field or a number field , we can take <m> K = \mathbb { Q } _ \ell </m> , we can consider the functor <m> M o t ( k ) _ { \mathbb { Q } _ { \ell } } \rightarrow G a l R e p ( \mathbb { Q } _ \ell ) </m> which sends <m> X </m> to its <m> \ell </m> - adic cohomology <m> H ^ i ( X _ { \overline { k } } , \mathbb { Q } _ \ell ) </m> as an <m> \ell </m> - adic galois representation . then the tate conjecture is that this functor is fully faithful . in the number field case , there are some other conjecturally fully faithful enriched realization functors discussed in ch . 7 of andre 's book `` une introduction aux motifs '' . motivation : now in <m> p </m> - adic hodge theory , we deal with varieties over a complete discrete valuation field -LRB- for example <m> k = \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> -RRB- , and study the extra structures which one obtains on the de rham cohomology of such a variety from hodge theory , crystalline cohomology , and etale cohomology . to me it seems that one is trying to endow the de rham cohomology of a variety <m> X </m> with as much `` natural '' structure as possible , at least enough to determine the galois representation <m> H ^ i ( X _ { \overline { k } } , \mathbb { Q } _ p ) </m> , but possibly one can add more . so i wonder the following :
i am currently attending a course where we are now covering the stone-cech compactification . today we proved in some detail that extensions of bounded smooth functions on <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> to <m> \beta \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> are point-separating on <m> \beta \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> . i am finding it a bit difficult to get any motivation as to why anyone would care about this result at all -LRB- i guess the corresponding statement for continuous functions would follow trivially from the urysohn lemma -RRB- . does point separation lead to other important consequences ? i could really use some insight on this . the professor mentioned in passing about something called the gelfand-naimark correspondence . is that related to this in any way ? thanks !
there is a well-known quillen 's localization sequence for -LRB- algebraic -RRB- k-theory : <m> \dots \to K _ p ^ Y ( X ) \to K _ p ( X ) \to K _ p ( X - Y ) \to \dots </m> , where <m> Y \to X </m> is a closed embedding of schemes . now suppose that <m> X </m> is regular -LRB- and excellent of finite dimension , if needed -RRB- . another well-known fact is that -LRB- in this case -RRB- the relative k-theory group <m> K _ p ^ Y ( X ) </m> is isomorphic to <m> K ' _ p ( Y ) </m> -LRB- some authors denote this by <m> G _ p ( Y ) </m> ; note that <m> Y </m> is not necessarily regular ! -RRB- . now , i tensor this long exact sequence by <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> . can i consider the <m> i </m> - th graded piece of the <m> \gamma </m> - filtration for this long exact sequence ? certainly , <m> K ^ { } ( X ) \otimes \mathbb { Q } </m> and <m> K ^ * ( X - Y ) \otimes \mathbb { Q } </m> are endowed with <m> \gamma </m> - filtration , but i am not quite sure about <m> K ' _ p ( Y ) \otimes \mathbb { Q } </m> -LRB- one of my problems here is that i am interested in quite a general situation -RRB- . also , could i say that the <m> i </m> - th level of the <m> \gamma </m> - filtration for <m> K ' _ p ( Y ) </m> is some -LRB- which one ?? -RRB- level of its niveau filtration ? which references are most appropriate for these matters ? i believe that for rational coefficients these things are easier than for integral ones .
any symmetric operad can be considered as an non - <m> \Sigma </m> operad by throwing away permutations . does anyone know what sort of structure one gets for algebras over <m> C _ n </m> the little n-cubes operad , or some equivalent variant , considered in this way ? one thing which is strange is that there is a non - <m> \Sigma </m> operad splitting of the map <m> A s s \to C o m </m> -LRB- where <m> A s s </m> and <m> C o m </m> are the symmetric associative and commutative operads , respectively -RRB- , and so any non - <m> \Sigma </m> <m> C _ n </m> algebra should be a loop space , but i do not see what , if any , extra structure is present .
where can i find a proof that <m> \mathcal { D } ( 0 , T ; V ) </m> -LRB- the space of <m> V </m> - valued compactly supported functions on <m> [ 0 , T ] </m> -RRB- is dense in the space <m> W ( 0 , T ) </m> , where <m> W ( 0 , T ) : = \{ u \in L ^ 2 ( 0 , T ; V ) : u ' \in L ^ 2 ( 0 , T ; V ^ * ) \} , </m> where <m> V </m> is hilbert \ banach ? i need the proof in the english language .
we denote by <m> \frak p \le q </m> the abbreviation that there is <m> f : \frak p \to q </m> which is injective , and by <m> \frak p \le ^ \ast q </m> we abbreviate that there is a surjection from <m> \frak q </m> onto <m> \frak p </m> . if <m> X </m> is a set in a universe of zf , denote by <m> H ( X ) = \min \lbrace \alpha \mid \alpha \nleq X \rbrace </m> known as the hartog number of <m> X </m> . it is clear that <m> H ( X ) \nleq X </m> . under the axiom of choice <m> X \leq Y \iff X \leq ^ \ast Y </m> , however without the axiom of choice the <m> \leq ^ \ast </m> order can behave quite strangely . for example , it is possible that <m> \omega _ 1 \nleq 2 ^ \omega </m> , but it is always true that <m> \omega _ 1 \leq ^ \ast 2 ^ \omega </m> . this may occur when the continuum is a countable union of countable sets , or if we are in a solovay-like model . monro showed in -LSB- 1 -RSB- that it is consistent to have for every <m> \kappa </m> an infinite set <m> p </m> such <m> H ( p ) = \omega </m> and <m> \kappa \leq ^ \ast p </m> . in those two instances we have examples where the axiom of choice fails , and <m> H ( x ) \leq ^ \ast x </m> . if we do not wish to add large cardinal into the mix both the examples above are such that the axiom of countable choice already fails in . questions :
it is known that if <m> ( X , d ) </m> is a compact metric space , then hyperspace <m> 2 ^ X = \{ A \subseteq X : A \text { i s c l o s e d s e t } \} </m> is a compact space with hausdorff metric what can say about <m> 2 ^ X = \{ A \subseteq X : A \text { i s c l o s e d s e t } \} </m> , when <m> ( X , \mathcal { U } ) </m> is a compact uniform space ?
let <m> E </m> be an elliptic curve over <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> with potential good reduction . i was told that if <m> F </m> is the smallest galois extension over <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> such that <m> E </m> has good reduction then the inertia subgroup <m> I _ { v ' } </m> of <m> G _ { F / \mathbb { Q } _ p } </m> is a subgroup of the automorphism group of <m> \widetilde { E } </m> . here <m> \widetilde { E } </m> is the elliptic curve reduced mod the unique maximal ideal of the ring of integers of <m> F </m> . i would like a reference for this result , and i could n't find it in silverman 's `` the arithmetic of elliptic curves '' -LRB- unless i missed it ... -RRB- . i would greatly appreciate any comments or a reference for this . thank you .
the usual construction for finding torsion elements on complex <m> K </m> theory is using flat vector bundles . so is it still possible to find a simply connected compact space with a nonzero torsion in its <m> K </m> theory . such an example would be given by a map <m> f : X \to B U </m> which is zero on real cohomology but is not null homotopic . by bott periodicity theorem , it follows that such a map would be zero on homotopy groups -LRB- because <m> \pi ^ s _ * ( Y ) \otimes \mathbb { R } = H _ * ( Y , \mathbb { R } ) = H ^ * ( Y , \mathbb { R } ) </m> and the homotopy groups of <m> B U </m> are free abelian -RRB- . i do n't know if such a map could exist or not . i am most interested in the case of a closed simply connected manifold but an example in the general case would be welcome .
it is well-known that , <m> a ^ 3 + b ^ 3 + c ^ 3 = N \tag 1 </m> for <m> N = 1 , \, 2 </m> is solvable in the integers in infinitely many ways . however , it is an open question -LRB- but is conjectured -RRB- that if for general <m> N </m> it has a solution , then it must have infinitely many . i 'd like to propose a variant ,
despite both zetas <m> \zeta ( s , X ) </m> and <m> \zeta ( s ) </m> have the same functional equation , the same euler prodcut and the same riemann-weil formula why one of them is ` easy ' and can be solved but the other is so hard ?? the zeta one <m> \zeta ( s ) </m>
my question is regarding the definition of <m> \mathcal { D } </m> - modules of level <m> m </m> given in this paper . as an example , let <m> X = \mathbb { A } ^ 1 </m> over <m> S = \text { S p e c } \overline { \mathbb { F } _ p } </m> ; i was told that a <m> \mathcal { D } </m> - module of level <m> m </m> is a module over <m> \mathbb { k } \langle x , \partial _ x , \frac { { \partial _ x } ^ p } { p ! } , \cdots , \frac { { \partial _ x } ^ { p ^ m } } { ( p ^ m ) ! } \rangle </m> ; i was wondering how to work this out from first principles , using definition <m> 2 . 5 </m> given in that paper . consider the immersion <m> X \rightarrow X \times _ S X </m> . definition <m> 2 . 1 </m> from that paper defines what a divided power structure of level <m> m </m> on an immersion is ; definition <m> 2 . 3 </m> -LRB- and <m> 2 . 4 </m> -RRB- states constructs the divided power envelope of level <m> m </m> , <m> P _ { X , m } ( Y ) </m> . subsequently , on pg <m> 5 </m> they define <m> \mathcal { P } _ { X , m } ^ n ( Y ) </m> ; the sheaf of differential operators of level <m> m </m> is defined to be union of the duals of this family of sheaves -LRB- as <m> n </m> varies -RRB- . most of the details/proofs are done in this other paper . i 'm having trouble properly understanding these definitions and working out what they are in the case of <m> X = \mathbb { A } ^ 1 , S = \text { S p e c } \overline { \mathbb { F } _ p } </m> . so , my question is what the above objects look like in this particular example , and how to explicitly calculate everything in this example .
it seems natural to me to generalize the notion of perfect number to rings of integers more general that <m> { \Bbb Z } </m> . i 'll want to think of number fields concretely , as subfields of <m> { \Bbb C } </m> . for a mutatis mutandis definition , a given algebraic integer must have a distinguished finite set of divisors . that makes two tricky parts : figuring out what to say if the group of units is richer than <m> \{ - 1 , 1 \} </m> making due with the order if the field is not a subfield of <m> { \Bbb R } </m> . do definitions occur in the literature ? do nontrivial examples exist ?
is there an explicit description of the pontryagin product on the homology of <m> C P ^ { \infty } </m> ? also , what is the homology of the classifying spaces <m> B U ( n ) </m> ?
denote the 1-d torus as <m> \mathbb { T } : = \mathbb { R } / \mathbb { Z } </m> . using fourier series , one can define the sobolev space <m> H ^ k ( \mathbb { T } ) </m> -LRB- see for instance this note from wikipedia -RRB- . on the other hand , the definition of <m> H ^ k ( U ) </m> with <m> U = ( 0 , 1 ) </m> is well known . could anyone come up with a reference for the definition of sobolev spaces <m> H ^ k ( \Omega ) </m> where <m> \Omega = ( 0 , 1 ) \times \mathbb { T } </m> ? -LRB- such functions would in particular be periodic in the second component . they appear in pde for channel flows . -RRB-
alternate formulation of the question -LRB- i think -RRB- : what 's a precise version of the statement : `` in a stable <m> \infty </m> - category , finite limits and finite colimits coincide '' ? recall that a stable <m> \infty </m> - category is a type of finitely complete and cocomplete <m> \infty </m> - category characterized by certain exactness conditions . namely ,
let <m> X </m> be a compact smooth surface in <m> \mathbb R ^ d </m> with smooth boundary <m> \partial X </m> . is it possible to find another smooth surface <m> Y </m> in <m> \mathbb R ^ d </m> such that <m> \partial X = \partial Y </m> and <m> Y </m> is isometric -LRB- resp . conformally equivalent -RRB- to <m> X </m> ? the metric is supposed to be induced from <m> \mathbb R ^ d </m> . the same question for holomorphic chains -LRB- in particular , for complex curves with boundary -RRB- in <m> \mathbb C ^ d </m> has the negative answer : if two compact holomorphic chains have the same boundary , they are equal . locally it is the statement of the cauchy integral formula from complex analysis and globaly it is the result of harwey-shiffman 1975 -LRB- proposition 3.5 -RRB- .
let <m> R </m> be a regular algebra over a field <m> k </m> of char 0 . let <m> D </m> be its corresponding algebra of differential operators . as in the general setting of non-commutative algebra we can tensor right <m> D </m> - modules with left <m> D </m> - modules to get <m> R </m> - modules . however in this case we have more operations available to us . let <m> M </m> and <m> N </m> be left <m> D </m> - modules . one can define using the leibniz rule a structure of a <m> D </m> - module on the tensor product <m> M \otimes _ R N </m> . the same can be done if we replace one of the factors with a right <m> D </m> - modules and flip some signs and similar statements exist for internal homs over <m> R </m> -LRB- i 'm not so sure about right tensor right - although i assume that at least in the derived setting one can always use duality to define this structure -RRB- . now , my question is rather vague . i 'm trying to understand conceptually what properties of <m> D </m> makes it possible to give a <m> D </m> - module structure on <m> M \otimes _ R N </m> and maybe understand in what way is this construction canonical -LRB- since so far all i 've seen is a formula in this context -RRB- . so to summarize :
i want to consider the crossed module : <m> H \xrightarrow { t } A u t ( H ) </m> for the case where <m> H = G L _ n ( \mathbb { Z } ) = A u t ( T ^ n ) </m> is the automorphism group of the <m> n </m> - torus . any suggestions on how to understand this automorphism group , <m> A u t ( G L _ n ( \mathbb { Z } ) ) </m> , explicitly ?
in the paper `` graphs , groupoids and cuntz-krieger algebras '' by kumijan , pask , raeburn , renault it was shown -LRB- if i understand it correctly -RRB- that whenever <m> G </m> is a row-finite directed graph with no sinks then the corresponding graph <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra is isomorphic to the groupoid <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra w.r. to a suitable groupoid having the space of infinite paths as its unit space . my question is whether it is possible to remove the limitation of having no sinks ; i know that a typical way of `` desingularizing '' this sort of graphs is to add an infinite tail to any sink . does it remain true , then , that the graph <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra is isomorphic to the groupoid <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra associated to the path groupoid ? on a more general note : what is known about functoriality of these three procedures ? <m> \begin {aligned} \textrm { g r a p h } & \longrightarrow C ^ * \textrm { - a l g e b r a } \\ \textrm { g r o u p o i d } & \longrightarrow C ^ * \textrm { - a l g e b r a } \\ \textrm { g r a p h } & \longrightarrow \textrm { g r o u p o i d } \end {aligned} </m>
let <m> R = \bigoplus _ { i \geq 0 } R _ i </m> be a cohen-macaulay graded ring -LRB- <m> R _ 0 </m> is a field and <m> R </m> is generated by <m> R _ 1 </m> -RRB- of dimension <m> d </m> with canonical module <m> \omega _ R </m> , and <m> M </m> a graded cohen-macaulay <m> R </m> - module of dimension <m> t </m> . assume that we know the hilbert series , hilbert polynomial and all betti numbers of <m> M </m> . what can be said about the multiplicity of <m> \textrm { E x t } ^ { d - t } ( M , \omega _ R ) </m> ? can we compute it from the given data ?
let <m> \Sigma _ g </m> be a riemann surface of genus <m> g \geq 2 </m> and <m> G = \pi _ 1 ( \Sigma _ g ) </m> . let <m> \pi \colon \mathbb { H } \to \Sigma _ g </m> be the universal covering map . what kind of surface is <m> \mathbb { H } / [ G , G ] </m> ? moreover , what is <m> [ G , G ] </m> ; e.g. if <m> g = 2 </m> ?
i have tried evaluating this series <m> \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \frac { H _ { n } ^ 3 } { ( n + 1 ) 2 ^ n } </m> using some methods but it 's seems to me that it is very hard . however , i noticed that the series converges faster than the riemann series . my question here is : is there some mathematical technique for evaluating the above series ? note1 : here , <m> H _ n </m> denotes the harmonic numbers . edit : i have a wrong type i meant in the denomenator <m> 2 ^ n </m> thank you for any help .
is there a result which gives a lower bound on the number of inverse pairs <m> ( a , a ^ { - 1 } ) </m> modulo prime <m> p </m> lying in the interval <m> [ 1 , t ] </m> , where <m> t < p </m> ?
i asked this question on mathstack -LRB- long time ago -RRB- , however i received no answers , so i 'm trying it here . i do n't know whether it 's suitable for this site , anyway . i was reading this article http://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/cech.pdf and i could not understand the construction of the left adjoint of the inclusion <m> \mathbf { P S h } ( C , J ) \rightarrowtail \mathbf { S h } ( C , J ) </m> in page 14 . usually the condition for <m> F </m> being a sheaf is that there exists a unique lifting of <m> R \rightarrow F </m> to <m> h _ U </m> for every <m> U </m> and <m> R \in J ( U ) </m> , however the author uses a coequalizer -LRB- in the category <m> \mathbf { P S h } ( C , J ) </m> -RRB- instead a of sieve , and i can not see the equivalence between these two definitions -LRB- i know that <m> N a t ( R , F ) </m> corresponds to a compatible family of elements -RRB- . furthermore , i can not understand the functor <m> \mathscr { B } </m> created as a pushout ? what would be <m> \mathscr { B } </m> in a topological space instead of a site ? moreover , the construction iterating the applications of <m> \mathscr { B } </m> and <m> \mathscr { A } </m> seens totally unintuitive and i have no idea how to prove that this colimit is in fact left adjoint to the inclusion . the unique construction that i have ever saw of the sheaffication in sites is applying <m> { + } </m> two times , where <m> F ^ { + } ( c ) = c o l i m _ { R \in J ( c ) } R </m> . thanks in advance .
given a map of <m> n </m> - fold loop spaces <m> X \to Y </m> , we can take the homotopy cofiber , denote it <m> Y / X </m> -LRB- all spaces here will also have a base point , and all maps pointed -RRB- . i have some basic questions about this construction :
it is well known that the convolution of a <m> L ^ 1 </m> function and a schwartz function is also in <m> L ^ 1 </m> , by young 's inequality for convolution . let <m> f \in L ^ 1 ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) </m> and <m> \phi \in S ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) </m> , where <m> \phi </m> is nonnegative , radial , and radially decreasing . set <m> \phi _ \epsilon ( x ) = \epsilon ^ { - n } \phi ( x / \epsilon ) </m> . my question is , whether the supremum of this convolution <m> { \rm s u p } _ { \epsilon > 0 } | f \ast \phi _ \epsilon | \in L ^ 1 ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) \ ? </m> remark : we denote the hardy-littlewood maximal function of <m> f </m> by <m> M f </m> . recall that <m> { \rm s u p } _ { \epsilon > 0 } | f \ast \phi _ \epsilon | ( x ) \le M f ( x ) \int _ { \mathbb { R } ^ n } \phi d x . </m> the hardy-littlewood maximal theorem tells us that if <m> f \in L ^ p ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) </m> , <m> 1 < p \le \infty </m> , then <m> M f \in L ^ p ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) , </m> while if <m> f \in L ^ 1 ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) </m> , then <m> M f \notin L ^ 1 ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) </m> , whenever <m> f \ne 0 </m> on some positive measure set . therefore , we get <m> f \in L ^ p ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) , \ 1 < p \le \infty \Rightarrow { \rm s u p } _ { \epsilon > 0 } | f \ast \phi _ \epsilon | \in L ^ p ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) . </m> however , we do n't know whether it still holds for <m> p = 1 </m> .
the question is a special case of a previous question . let <m> M </m> be a compact smooth manifold , then it is clear that <m> C ^ { \infty } ( M ) </m> is a frechet algebra with pointwise multiplication and a collection of semi-norm defined by <m> p _ { \alpha } ( f ) : = \sup _ { \beta \leq \alpha } | | \partial ^ { \beta } ( f ) | | </m> . now let <m> E \to M </m> be a <m> C ^ { \infty } </m> - fiber bundle with compact base and compact fiber . then it is clear that <m> C ^ { \infty } ( E ) </m> , the space of smooth functions on the total space of the fiber bundle , is a frechet <m> C ^ { \infty } ( M ) </m> - module .
in the classification of finite simple groups , some classification is done by considering structure of sylow - <m> 2 </m> subgroups -LRB- for example , here ; it is more than 250 page paper ! -RRB- now in the world of finite groups , <m> 2 </m> - groups appear very large in number and their classification is difficult -LRB- incomplete ! -RRB- . then , looking for classifying simple groups with knowing structure of its sylow - <m> 2 </m> subgroup could even be difficult , which i feel after thinking this way . i do n't have idea what could be motivation for classification in this way . since there is no pattern -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- in the classification of finite <m> 2 </m> - groups , is there any pattern of sylow - <m> 2 </m> subgroups in the family of finite simple groups ? in other words , let 's say we have all simple groups in a box ; can we partition these groups according to sylow - <m> 2 </m> subgroups in nice way ? -LRB- beside above question , i would be happy for posting known results on following : what families of simple groups have been characterized from their sylow - <m> 2 </m> subgroups ? -RRB-
i have a matrix <m> A </m> which is strictly lower triangular . now , i am trying to find some general statements/relationships of following matrices <m> U , D , V , K </m> defined as : <m> A A ^ T = V K V ^ H </m> , <m> [ ( I - A ) ( I - A ) ^ T ] ^ { - 1 } = U D ^ { - 1 } U ^ H </m> is it possible to put <m> D </m> and <m> K </m> into some relations and also <m> U </m> and <m> V </m> ? from simple examples it is possible to see much structure between <m> A A ^ T </m> and <m> [ ( I - A ) ( I - A ) ^ T ) ] ^ { - 1 } </m> , however , in `` matrix analysis '' by horn & johnson i was not able to find something useful for this case . maybe someone has some great idea ! many thanks in advance !
hello , is there any classification of proper maximal subroups of <m> G L _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } / p ^ k \mathbb { Z } ) </m> for <m> k > 1 </m> -LRB- analogous to the one which exist for <m> G L _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } / p \mathbb { Z } ) </m> -RRB- ? could you give me some references ? thank you very much .
the tensor product of some -LRB- finite dimensional real -RRB- vector spaces is acted on by the direct product of their general linear groups . i would like to know if there are explicit invariants in the case of 3 vector spaces . for one vector space there are two orbits : 0 vector , and non-zero vector . for two vector spaces , <m> T \in U \otimes V \cong H o m ( U ^ * , V ) </m> there are finitely many orbits characterized by <m> r a n k ( T ) </m> . for 3 vector spaces the dimension of <m> U \otimes V \otimes W </m> is <m> u v w </m> and the dimension of <m> G L ( U ) \times G L ( V ) \times G L ( W ) </m> is <m> u ^ 2 + v ^ 2 + w ^ 2 </m> so that usually the space of orbits has positive dimension . any references would be most welcome . i am particularly interested in the case u , v have dimension 4 and w has dimension 8 .
the griffiths twin cone is an example of a wedge sum of two contractible spaces being non-contractible . namely , it is the wedge sum <m> \mathbb G = C \mathbb H \vee _ p C \mathbb H </m> of two coni over the hawaiian earring by the bad point <m> p \in \mathbb H </m> . however , as stated at the bottom of this post , <m> H o m ( \pi _ 1 ( \mathbb G ) , \mathbb Z ) = 0 </m> . is there any example of two contractible spaces whose wedge sum 's fundamental group would allow a surjection onto <m> \mathbb Z </m> ?
i am interested to know the list of non-rational smooth fano 3-folds with picard number greater than 1 -LRB- more precisely families where at least one smooth member is known to be non-rational -RRB- . it seems that there are not so many . in the list of fano 3-folds that i have at hand , it states whether each fano 3-fold is rational or not in almost all cases . but unfortunately , there is a ? written next to one of the varieties and the authors leave a gap next to 5 other cases . i am not sure whether these omissions are due to the rationality of these varieties being an open problem , or whether it is due to some complicated situation with some rational and non-rational varieties in the family . any enlightenment about the state of the art would be greatly appreciated . the examples i did manage to obtain from this list are -LRB- in no particular order -RRB- : 1 . double cover of <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 \times \mathbb { P } ^ 2 </m> , branched along a divisor of bi-degree <m> ( 2 , 4 ) </m> .

'' remark : observing the initial numbers is not sufficient because the nearer to <m> 1 </m> the value <m> \frac X Z + \frac Y Z </m> is , the harder it is to find the answer -LRB- see example 2 -RRB- . this question has been asked previously on math.se without receiving any answers . examples :
hello , this is a request for literature/a reference . i 'm looking to do some calculations with the symmetric group -LRB- <m> S _ 6 </m> and higher -RRB- and would be interested in explicit expressions for 3-cocycles , i.e. elements of <m> H ^ 3 ( S _ 6 , U ( 1 ) ) </m> . does anyone know whether these have already been calculated somewhere ?
-LRB- i 've posted this question earlier to mse but did not receive answers , so i 'll try it here . i also condensed the wording , hopefully not too much -RRB- let <m> \displaystyle \small \qquad f _ w = ( 2 - 1 ) ( 3 - 1 ) ( 5 - 1 ) \ldots ( p _ w - 1 ) \qquad = \prod _ { k = 1 } ^ w ( p r i m e ( k ) - 1 ) </m> or in general with a natural number for the exponent n <m> \displaystyle \small ( 1 ) \qquad f _ w ( n ) = ( 2 ^ n - 1 ) ( 3 ^ n - 1 ) ( 5 ^ n - 1 ) \ldots ( p _ w ^ n - 1 ) \qquad = \prod _ { k = 1 } ^ w ( p r i m e ( k ) ^ n - 1 ) </m> with w going to infinity . then let 's denote the canonical primefactorization of that product <m> \displaystyle \small ( 2 ) \qquad f _ w ( n ) = 2 ^ { a _ { n , 1 } } \cdot 3 ^ { a _ { n , 2 } } \cdot 5 ^ { a _ { n , 3 } } \cdot \ldots \cdot q _ k ^ { a _ { n , k } } \cdot \ldots </m> using q for the primefactors here to avoid confusion between the two representations . i am interested , whether there is an analytical expression for the relative frequencies <m> \small ( 3 ) \qquad r _ w ( n , k ) = a _ { n , k } / w </m> in the limit in the latter expression . empirically -LRB- using the first 600000 primes in formula -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- i found approximations to rational values for the relative frequencies of the first few primefactors q in formula -LRB- 2 -RRB- giving a somehow meaningful table , where , after scaling near to integers , for small primes q the error was in the near of 1/1000 . however , i can not determine , whether the deviations from my estimated analytical formula are random and are vanishing in the limit or whether they keep a bias . especially the primefactor q = 2 in the formula -LRB- 2 -RRB- seems to have a nonrandom bias which might survive in the limit . here is the table . the entries <m> \small e _ { n , q } </m> give the rounded empirical frequencies <m> \small e _ { n , q } \approx a _ { n , k } / w \cdot ( q - 1 ) ^ 2 </m> <m> \small \qquad \begin {array} { r | r r r r r r r r r r r r } n & 2 & 3 & 5 & 7 & 1 1 & 1 3 & 1 7 & 1 9 & 2 3 & ( \ldots \text { p r i m e f a c t o r } q ) \\ \hline \\ 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 7 & 1 1 & 1 3 & 1 7 & 1 9 & 2 3 \\ 2 & 4 & 6 & 1 0 & 1 4 & 2 2 & 2 6 & 3 4 & 3 8 & 4 6 \\ 3 & 2 & 5 & 5 & 2 1 & 1 1 & 3 9 & 1 7 & 5 7 & 2 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 & 2 0 & 1 4 & 2 2 & 5 2 & 6 8 & 3 8 & 4 6 \\ 5 & 2 & 3 & 9 & 7 & 5 5 & 1 3 & 1 7 & 1 9 & 2 3 \\ 6 & 4 & 1 0 & 1 0 & 4 2 & 2 2 & 7 8 & 3 4 & 1 1 4 & 4 6 \\ 7 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 1 3 & 1 1 & 1 3 & 1 7 & 1 9 & 2 3 \\ 8 & 6 & 6 & 2 0 & 1 4 & 2 2 & 5 2 & 1 3 6 & 3 8 & 4 6 \\ 9 & 2 & 7 & 5 & 2 1 & 1 1 & 3 9 & 1 7 & 1 7 1 & 2 3 \\ 1 0 & 4 & 6 & 1 8 & 1 4 & 1 1 0 & 2 6 & 3 4 & 3 8 & 4 6 \\ 1 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 7 & 2 1 & 1 3 & 1 7 & 1 9 & 2 5 3 \\ 1 2 & 5 & 1 0 & 2 0 & 4 2 & 2 2 & 1 5 6 & 6 8 & 1 1 4 & 4 6 \\ 1 3 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 7 & 1 1 & 2 5 & 1 7 & 1 9 & 2 3 \\ 1 4 & 4 & 6 & 1 0 & 2 6 & 2 2 & 2 6 & 3 4 & 3 8 & 4 6 \\ 1 5 & 2 & 5 & 9 & 2 1 & 5 5 & 3 9 & 1 7 & 5 7 & 2 3 \\ 1 6 & 7 & 6 & 2 0 & 1 4 & 2 2 & 5 2 & 2 7 2 & 3 8 & 4 6 \\ 1 7 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 7 & 1 1 & 1 3 & 3 3 & 1 9 & 2 3 \\ 1 8 & 4 & 1 4 & 1 0 & 4 2 & 2 2 & 7 8 & 3 4 & 3 4 2 & 4 6 \end {array} </m> the heuristical formula that i extrapolated -LRB- letting w increase towards infinity -RRB- has two forms : if q = 2 and n is even -LRB- gcd -LRB- n , q -RRB- = 2 -RRB- : <m> \small \qquad e _ { n , 2 } = ( 3 + \operatorname { v a l } ( n , 2 ) ) </m> where the function val -LRB- n , q -RRB- means : the exponent , to which primefactor q occurs in n for all other cases <m> \small \qquad e _ { n , q } = \gcd ( n , q - 1 ) \cdot ( q + ( q - 1 ) \cdot \operatorname { v a l } ( n , q ) ) </m> then <m> \small \qquad \displaystyle a _ { n , q } = { e _ { n , q } \cdot w \over ( q - 1 ) ^ 2 } </m> can the guessed formula be confirmed by an analytical argument ?
shalom -LSB- edit : originally m. burger -RSB- showed that the pair <m> ( \mathrm { S L } _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } ) \ltimes \mathbb { Z } ^ 2 , \mathbb { Z } ^ 2 ) </m> has relative property -LRB- t -RRB- with respect to standard generating sets . -LRB- the action of <m> \mathrm { S L } _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> on <m> \mathbb { Z } ^ 2 </m> is the usual one , i.e. the semidirect product can be thought of as a group of affine transformations <m> x \mapsto A x + b </m> where <m> A \in \mathrm { S L } _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> and <m> b \in \mathbb { Z } ^ 2 </m> . if we reduce <m> \mathrm { m o d } \ p </m> , we can think of this as giving an `` efficient '' way of generating the translations <m> x \mapsto x + b </m> for <m> b \in F _ p ^ 2 </m> . -RRB- a one-dimensional variant in the finite case is whether there exist bounded size subsets <m> S _ p \subset F _ p ^ { \times } \ltimes F _ p </m> and <m> \delta > 0 </m> such that the relative kazhdan constant : <m> \kappa \ ( F _ p ^ { \times } \ltimes F _ p , F _ p , S _ p ) \ge \delta </m> i.e. whether the pairs <m> ( F _ p ^ { \times } \ltimes F _ p , F _ p ) </m> can form a relative expander family . an equivalent formulation : do there exist bounded size sets <m> S _ p </m> of affine transformations on <m> F _ p </m> , such that no non-empty subset <m> U \subset F _ p </m> , <m> | U | \leq p / 2 </m> is almost invariant with respect to all of them , i.e. <m> \neg \exists U : \forall s \in S : | s ( U ) \cap U | > \frac { 9 9 } { 1 0 0 } | U | </m> i believe the answer is no if one uses standard `` generating '' sets -LRB- they need n't actually generate -RRB- such as <m> x \mapsto x + 1 , \ x \mapsto a x </m> , even if <m> a </m> is allowed to vary with <m> p </m> . this is very slightly surprising , as these do generate all translations `` efficiently '' in the weaker sense of logarithmic diameter . is there a good argument as to why this should fail in general ? or might there be cunning sets <m> S _ p </m> such that relative expansion occurs ?
suppose <m> X </m> is a complex manifold . if <m> X </m> is kähler , the cohomology groups decompose into subgroups represented by <m> ( p , q ) </m> - forms . if <m> X </m> is not kähler , i think the decomposition may not hold ? is there an example where we have a nonzero class be represented by both a <m> ( p , q ) </m> - form and a <m> ( p ' , q ' ) </m> - form with <m> ( p , q ) \neq ( p ' , q ' ) </m> ?

let <m> n </m> be a positive integer . consider the family of extensions <m> 0 \to O ( - n ) \to E \to O ( n ) \to 0 , </m> parameterized by <m> H ^ 1 ( O ( - 2 n ) ) </m> . for each element <m> e \in H ^ 1 ( O ( - 2 n ) ) </m> we get a rank two bundle <m> E </m> that is of the form <m> O ( - k ) \oplus O ( k ) </m> with <m> 0 \le k \le n </m> . generic <m> E </m> is isomorphic to <m> O \oplus O </m> . question . how to describe the stratification on <m> H ^ 1 ( O ( - 2 n ) ) </m> according to various <m> k </m> ? is there some nice reference working out this example ?

suppose <m> X </m> is a surface , are there examples for curves on x which not 1-connected , but <m> h ^ 0 ( C , O _ C ) = 1 </m> ? -LRB- here a curve is an effective divisor , not necessarily reduced or irreducible -RRB- -LRB- 1-connectedness means when it splits into two effective divisors , the two parts have intesection number greater than or equal to 1 -RRB- another question is i am not sure if the dimension of cohomology and 1-connectedness is preserved by linear equivalence ?
let <m> k </m> be a field of characteristic zero and <m> A </m> be a <m> k </m> - algebra . a derivation on <m> A </m> is a <m> k </m> - linear map <m> D : A \to A </m> such that <m> D ( a b ) = a D ( b ) + b D ( a ) , \forall a , b \in A </m> . a derivation is called locally nilpotent if for every <m> a \in A </m> , <m> \exists n _ a \in \mathbb N </m> such that <m> D ^ { n _ a } ( a ) = 0 </m> , where <m> D ^ n </m> means <m> D </m> composed with itself <m> n </m> - times . my question is : given a finitely generated <m> k </m> - algebra <m> A </m> which is also an integral domain , does there exist a locally nilpotent derivation on <m> A [ X , Y ] </m> whose kernel is <m> A </m> ?
fix an integer <m> n \ge 2 </m> and suppose that <m> { \cal L } </m> is a set of lines in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> . is there a set <m> M \subseteq \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> with the following properties ?
if <m> A </m> is a finite dimensional commutative , associative , unital algebra over a field <m> \mathbb { K } </m> then does there exist a non-zero vector <m> v \in A \otimes _ { \mathbb { K } } A </m> such that <m> ( a \otimes _ { \mathbb { K } } 1 ) v = ( 1 \otimes _ { \mathbb { K } } a ) v </m> for all <m> a \in A </m> ? if <m> A </m> happens to be a frobenius algebra then we can take <m> v </m> to be the dual of the associated non-degenerate bilinear form . moreover , i think i have shown that for a <m> \mathbb { K } </m> - basis of <m> A </m> given by <m> e _ { i } </m> if there exists <m> v = \sum _ { i j } \beta ^ { i j } e _ { i } \otimes _ { \mathbb { K } } e _ { j } </m> and <m> \beta ^ { i j } </m> is non-degenerate then <m> \beta ^ { i j } </m> gives a frobenius form . my main interest is the case where <m> \mathbb { K } = \mathbb { R } </m> however i ca n't see this making much of a difference in general .

given two elements <m> A , B \in \text { S L } ( 2 , \mathbb { F } _ { 2 ^ n } ) </m> , is there a -LRB- computationally inexpensive -RRB- test one could perform to check whether together they generate the entire group ?
let <m> X </m> be a connected proper smooth curve over a finite field -LRB- so the generic point of <m> X </m> is the spectrum of a global field <m> K </m> -RRB- , and let <m> G \rightarrow X </m> be an affine <m> X </m> - group scheme of finite type . is <m> G ( X ) </m> finite ? i will accept any answer that assumes additional hypotheses on <m> G </m> , as long as the class of <m> G </m> under consideration includes all reductive group schemes -LRB- i.e. , smooth affine <m> G \rightarrow X </m> whose geometric fibers are -LRB- connected -RRB- reductive groups -RRB- . note that separatedness of <m> G \rightarrow X </m> ensures that after replacing <m> G </m> by the schematic image of its generic fiber one may without loss of generality assume that <m> G </m> is flat .
given a field <m> k </m> . we denote <m> A _ { m n } = k [ \{ X _ { i j } \} _ { 1 \le i \le m , 1 \le j \le n } ] </m> a polynomial ring of <m> m n </m> variables . given <m> m , n , r > 0 </m> , we have a natural homomorphism <m> \phi \colon A _ { m n } \to A _ { m r } \otimes _ k A _ { r n } </m> induced by matrix multiplication : <m> Z _ { i j } \mapsto \sum _ { l = 1 } ^ r X _ { i l } Y _ { l j } </m> . let <m> I \subseteq A = A _ { m n } </m> be the ideal generated by all <m> ( r + 1 ) </m> - minors of the matrix <m> ( X _ { i j } ) _ { 1 \le i \le m , 1 \le j \le n } </m> .
let <m> V </m> be a vector space of dimension <m> n </m> . let <m> S ^ k V </m> be a representation of <m> G L ( n ) </m> . i would like to know if there exists some characterization of finite dimensional <m> G L ( n ) </m> modules <m> V _ 1 , V _ 2 </m> such that exists <m> G L ( n ) </m> mapping <m> T : S ^ k V \rightarrow V _ 1 \otimes V _ 2 </m> such that for some <m> x </m> matrix <m> T ( x ) </m> is invertible . added : just to clarify : the mapping <m> T </m> itself may not be invertible i am asking that <m> T ( x ) </m> will be invertible in <m> V _ 1 \otimes V _ 2 </m> . for example the mapping <m> S ^ 2 V \rightarrow V \otimes V </m> is not invariable , but <m> T ( x ) </m> is invartable for most <m> x </m> 's . i am interested for a base field <m> \mathbb { C } </m> . and of course this may happen only in case when <m> S ^ k V </m> is a sub-representation of <m> V _ 1 \otimes V _ 2 </m> . in fact i do not know for which irreps <m> V _ 1 , V _ 2 </m> representation <m> V _ 1 \otimes V _ 2 </m> have <m> S ^ k V </m> as a component . i will be happy if you can give me a reference for this question .

i am badly stuck in some integration here and will appreciate any help out of it . <m> \int ^ \infty _ 0 f ( r ) d r = \int ^ \infty _ 0 \frac { A r } { 1 + C r ^ \alpha } e ^ { - B r ^ 2 } d r </m> if i let <m> u = B r ^ 2 </m> , then i get <m> = \frac { A } { 2 B } \int ^ \infty _ 0 \frac { \exp ( - u ) } { 1 + ( u / B ) ^ { \alpha / 2 } } d u </m> but i am stuck while proceeding further . any idea ?
let <m> K </m> be a link in <m> S ^ { 3 } </m> and <m> f : S ^ { 3 } \rightarrow S ^ { 3 } </m> a freely periodic map of order <m> n </m> with <m> f ( K ) = K </m> . let <m> \psi _ { f } : \pi _ { 1 } ( S ^ { 3 } \backslash K ) \rightarrow \pi _ { 1 } ( S ^ { 3 } \backslash K ) </m> be the induced fundamental group isomorphism when restricting to the complement of <m> K </m> . can it be the case that <m> \psi _ { f } ( \alpha ) = \alpha </m> for some loop <m> \alpha </m> in the fundamental group <m> \pi _ { 1 } ( S ^ { 3 } \backslash K ) </m> , or will the fixed loop under <m> \psi _ { f } </m> imply a non-empty fixed point set of <m> f </m> disjoint of <m> K </m> ?
informally , an <m> A _ \infty </m> - space is a monoid whose laws are only satisfied up to homotopy . let 's define now what i will call a `` homotopic monoid '' to be a space <m> M </m> together with a point <m> e \in { } M </m> and a multiplication <m> m : M \times { } M \to { } M </m> with the monoid laws satisfied `` up to a path '' . more precisely , if <m> F </m> is the fibration over <m> M ^ 3 </m> such that the fiber over <m> ( x , y , z ) </m> is the space of paths -LRB- in <m> M </m> -RRB- going from <m> m ( m ( x , y ) , z ) </m> to <m> m ( x , m ( y , z ) ) </m> , then i want a section of this fibration -LRB- the section is part of the structure of homotopic monoid -RRB- . and of course i want the same thing for the laws with <m> e </m> . at least from the point of view of homotopy type theory , this is a very natural homotopy-theoretic generalization of the notion of monoid -LRB- we just replaced equality by existence of a path -RRB- . my questions are :
jacquet , piateski-shapiro , and shalika defined new vectors for generic representations of <m> G L ( n , F ) </m> , where <m> F </m> is a non-archimedean local field . i know that this notion has been extended to <m> G S p ( 4 , F ) </m> . is there an extension to other <m> p </m> - adic groups ?
suppose <m> f \colon I \to \mathbb { R } </m> is a function in , say , <m> L ^ \infty </m> , and <m> I \subset \mathbb { R } </m> is a bounded interval . we may assume further regularity on <m> f </m> , such as lipschitz continuity or strict positivity , in case it matters . consider all polynomials of <m> f </m> , such as <m> 3 f ^ 4 - f ^ 2 + 2 </m> . these are in <m> L ^ 2 ( I ) </m> , since <m> f </m> is -LRB- essentially -RRB- bounded and <m> I </m> is bounded . let <m> P _ f </m> be the space of all such polynomials . what can one say about the closure of <m> P _ f </m> in <m> L ^ 2 ( I ) </m> , that is <m> \overline { P _ f } ^ { L ^ 2 ( I ) } </m> ? examples

suppose <m> K _ 3 </m> is the kronecker quiver with 3 arrows , and <m> M ^ { s s } _ { ( 2 , 2 ) } ( K _ 3 , ( - 1 , 1 ) ) </m> is the moduli space of semi stable representation of dimension <m> ( 2 , 2 ) </m> wrt the weight <m> ( - 1 , 1 ) </m> . it is claim in the introduction of https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0010251.pdf that this moduli space is isomorphic to <m> M _ { \mathbb { P } ^ 2 } ( 0 , 2 ) </m> , the moduli space of semi stable bundles of rank 2 with <m> c _ 1 = 0 </m> and <m> c _ 2 = 2 </m> . my question : why is this true and how is the isomorphism constructed ? ps : the authors of the above paper mentioned reflection functors , it would be great if someone can provide more reference . thanks in advance !
if <m> X </m> is a genus <m> g \geq 2 </m> curve over a number field <m> K </m> , then <m> X ( K ) </m> is finite by falting 's theorem . my question is how does <m> X _ L ( L ) </m> behave for finite field extensions <m> L / K </m> ? in particular , is there a bound on <m> X _ L ( L ) </m> for <m> L / K </m> that depends only on <m> X </m> and <m> [ L : K ] </m> ?
a knot <m> K </m> is said to have property p if every nontrivial dehn surgery on <m> K </m> yields a 3-manifold that is not simply connected . it is known that every knot except the unknot has property p. i am wondering what can be said about a link that admits a nontrivial dehn surgery that yields <m> S ^ 3 </m> . an <m> n </m> - component link <m> L </m> is said to have property r if some dehn surgery on <m> L </m> yields <m> \sharp ^ n S ^ 1 \times S ^ 2 </m> . the generalized property r conjecture says that any such link , together with the framing used to obtain <m> \sharp ^ n S ^ 1 \times S ^ 2 </m> must be handleslide equivalent to an unlink with each component having framing 0 . this conjecture is true for <m> n = 1 </m> but unknown even for <m> n = 2 </m> - see here . note that by kirby 's theorem , any two framed links that describe <m> \sharp ^ n S ^ 1 \times S ^ 2 </m> must differ by handleslides together with blowups and blowdowns - generalized property r is asserting that the latter moves are not necessary in the case of <m> \sharp ^ n S ^ 1 \times S ^ 2 </m> for any pair of <m> n </m> - component descriptions . is there any sort of generalized property p conjecture ? there are certainly lots of links that that have a surgery that yields <m> S ^ 3 </m> - for example any handlebody diagram for a 4-manifold without 1 - or 3-handles . in fact , there is a conjecture that any simply connected smooth closed 4-manifold admits such a handlebody description -LRB- note : this implies s4pc -RRB- - if this is true then any such 4-manifold would yield such a framed link . by considering the hopf link with either <m> ( 0 , 0 ) </m> - framing or <m> ( 0 , 1 ) </m> - framing , we obtain two descriptions of <m> S ^ 3 </m> that certainly are not handleslide equivalent - so property p does not generalize naively like property r. maybe there is a bound <m> f ( n ) </m> , such that any two <m> n </m> - component framed link descriptions of <m> S ^ 3 </m> require at most <m> f ( n ) </m> blowups and blowdowns , together with handleslides in order to get between them ?
let <m> V = \mathbb C ^ n </m> . consider the plethysm <m> \bigwedge ^ k S y m ^ d V </m> as a representation of <m> G L ( V ) </m> . in what special cases -LRB- e.g. , for what <m> k </m> , <m> d </m> , and <m> n </m> -RRB- is this representation 's decomposition into irreps known ? the only known nontrivial special case that i am aware of is when <m> k = 2 </m> : in this case the decomposition is <m> S _ { 2 d - 1 , 1 } \oplus S _ { 2 d - 3 , 3 } \oplus S _ { 2 d - 5 , 5 } \oplus \cdots </m> . when <m> n = 2 </m> , i also know that it is equivalent to find decompositions of plethysms of the form <m> S y m ^ k S y m ^ i V </m> . using the macaulay2 package schurrings , i computed all examples with <m> d \leq 8 </m> with no obvious patterns jumping out at me . i would be interested in any other special cases people know about -LRB- including ones which only apply to <m> n = 2 </m> -RRB- , conjectures along these lines , tables of computed data , or ideas about references that might be fruitful .
it is usually assumed , that some version of the central extended <m> G L ( \infty ) </m> group acts transitively on the space of tau-function of the kp integrable hierarchy . it means that any tau-function can be obtained by the action of some group element on any other tau-function -LRB- say , a trivial one <m> \tau = 1 </m> -RRB- . 1 -RRB- how should i define the corresponding <m> G L ( \infty ) </m> ? for example v. kac in his book `` infinite dimensional lie algebras '' defines corresponding algebra as <m>  </m> a _ -LCB- ij -RCB- <m> w i t h </m> i \ geq j <m> a r e </m> 0 <m>  </m> however , it is clear that this definition is too restrictive - in the applications we need the more general algebra elements with an infinite number of the non-zero matrix elements . in the book of m. jimbo , t. miwa and e. date , `` solitons : differential equations , symmetries and infinite dimensional algebras '' they consider the finite-band matrices , which is also too restrictive . the question is : how should we define the <m> g l _ \infty </m> algebra to describe all possible tau-functions ? 2 -RRB- assume we have a proper definition of <m> g l _ \infty </m> . how can we prove that corresponding group acts on the space of the tau-functions transitively ? in particular , if i have a tau-function of the kp hierarchy , can i restore a corresponding group element -LRB- which is not unique , of course -RRB- ?
let <m> f : ~ [ 0 , 1 ] ^ 3 \rightarrow \mathbb { R } </m> be <m> f ( x _ 0 , x _ 1 , x _ 2 ) = \log \left [ \left ( 1 + \frac { x _ 0 } { 1 + x _ 0 + \frac { x _ 1 } { 2 } + \frac { x _ 2 } { 4 } } \right ) \left ( 1 + \frac { x _ 1 } { 1 + x _ 1 + \frac { x _ 2 } { 2 } + \frac { x _ 0 } { 4 } } \right ) \left ( 1 + \frac { x _ 2 } { 1 + x _ 2 + \frac { x _ 0 } { 2 } + \frac { x _ 1 } { 4 } } \right ) \right ] . </m> my guess is that <m> f </m> is a concave function . the standard approach to prove multivariate concavity is to find the hessian matrix and prove that it is non-positive definite . however , it seems to be an overwhelming approach for this function . can we somehow use the structure of <m> f </m> to prove or disprove the concavity ? edit1 : the general form is <m> f : ~ [ 0 , 1 ] ^ n \rightarrow \mathbb { R } </m> <m> f ( x _ 0 , x _ 1 , \ldots , x _ { n - 1 } ) = \log \left [ \prod _ { k = 0 } ^ { n - 1 } \left ( 1 + \frac { x _ k } { 1 + \sum _ { j = 0 } ^ { n - 1 } q ^ j x _ { ( k + j ) ~ \text { m o d } ~ n } } \right ) \right ] , 0 < q < 1 . </m> edit2 : i changed the notation and started the indices from zero to make the general case accurate .
let <m> V ^ k \subset \mathbb C ^ n </m> be a sub variety , such that all its irreducible components have dimension <m> \ge k </m> . is it true that <m> \mathbb C ^ n \setminus V ^ k </m> has homotopy type of a cw complex of dimension <m> \le 2 n - k - 1 </m> ? comments . 1 -RRB- this is true for <m> k = n - 1 </m> , since in this case <m> \mathbb C ^ n \setminus V ^ { n - 1 } </m> is affine . case <m> k = 0 </m> is trivial . 2 -RRB- this question would help to answer : an analogue of lefschetz hyperplane theorem for complements to subvarieties in <m> \mathbb C ^ n </m> ?
this question comes from an unanswered question on math stack exchange . a two-component link in <m> \mathbb { R P } ^ 3 </m> is any embedding <m> S ^ 1 \uplus S ^ 1 \to \mathbb { R P } ^ 3 </m> . two such links are homotopic if there exists a homotopy between the maps such that the images of the circles remain disjoint at each intermediate stage . -LRB- note that each circle may pass through itself during the homotopy . -RRB- what is the set of homotopy classes of such links ? if either of the circles is nontrivial in <m> \pi _ 1 ( \mathbb { R P } ^ 3 ) </m> , then it seems to me that the possibilities are completely determined by the linking numbers of the various components of the preimages in <m> S ^ 3 </m> . however , if both of the circles are nullhomotopic then the situation in the cover is much more complicated .
let <m> u \in C ^ 0 ( [ 0 , \infty ) ; L ^ 1 ( M ) ) \cap W ^ { 1 , 1 } _ { \text { l o c } } ( ( 0 , \infty ) ; L ^ 1 ( M ) ) </m> with <m> u ( t ) \in H ^ 1 ( M ) </m> for a.e. <m> t </m> be the solution of the porous medium equation <m> \dot u = \Delta ( u ^ m ) </m> on a compact -LRB- closed -RRB- smooth riemannian manifold <m> M </m> , i.e. , it satisfies <m> \int _ M u _ 0 \varphi ( 0 ) = - \int _ 0 ^ T \int _ M u ( t ) \varphi ' ( t ) + \int _ 0 ^ T \int _ M \nabla u ^ m ( t ) \cdot \nabla \varphi ( t ) </m> for all test functions <m> \varphi \in C ^ 1 ( [ 0 , T ] \times M ) </m> that vanish at <m> t = T </m> . suppose <m> u _ 0 \in L ^ \infty ( M ) </m> . it is the claimed in this work on top of page 10 that the <m> L ^ p </m> norm decreases in time : <m> \lVert u ( t ) \rVert _ { L ^ p ( M ) } \leq \lVert u _ 0 \rVert _ { L ^ p ( M ) } </m> for all <m> t </m> and all <m> p </m> . formally this can be seen by : <m> \frac { d } { d t } \int _ M | u ( t ) | ^ p = p \int _ M | u ( t ) | ^ { p - 2 } u ( t ) u _ t ( t ) = p \int _ M \nabla ( | u ( t ) | ^ { p - 2 } u ( t ) ) \cdot \nabla ( u ^ m ( t ) ) \, = . . . = - p m ( p - 1 ) \int _ M | u ( t ) | ^ { p + m - 3 } | \nabla u ( t ) | ^ 2 \leq 0 . </m> note that the weak formulation is used in the second equality . obviously this calculation is formal because <m> u </m> is not that smooth . how do i make it rigorous ? edit : let us assume <m> u ( t ) \in L ^ \infty ( M ) </m> if necessary .

let <m> \mathrm { K } </m> be a field . denote <m> \mathrm { V e c t } _ { \mathrm { K } } </m> the category of k-vector spaces , <m> \mathrm { C o a l g } ^ { \mathrm { c o n i l } } </m> the category of conilpotent , coaugmented , coassociative coalgebras over k and <m> \mathrm { C o c o a l g } ^ { \mathrm { c o n i l } } </m> the category of conilpotent , coaugmented , coassociative and cocommutative coalgebras over k. then the forgetful functors <m> \mathrm { C o a l g } ^ { \mathrm { c o n i l } } \to \mathrm { V e c t } _ { \mathrm { K } } </m> and <m> \mathrm { C o c o a l g } ^ { \mathrm { c o n i l } } \to \mathrm { V e c t } _ { \mathrm { K } } </m> that take the cokernel of the coaugmentation admit right adjoints <m> \mathrm { T } : \mathrm { V e c t } _ { \mathrm { K } } \to \mathrm { C o a l g } ^ { \mathrm { c o n i l } } </m> respectively <m> \mathrm { R } : \mathrm { V e c t } _ { \mathrm { K } } \to \mathrm { C o c o a l g } ^ { \mathrm { c o n i l } } </m> and we have natural isomorphisms <m> \mathrm { T } ( \mathrm { V } ) \cong \oplus _ { i \geq 0 } \mathrm { V } ^ { \otimes i } </m> and <m> \mathrm { R } ( \mathrm { V } ) \cong \oplus _ { i \geq 0 } ( \mathrm { V } ^ { \otimes i } ) ^ { \Sigma _ i } </m> of k-vector spaces . denote <m> \mathrm { C a l g } </m> the category of augmented , associative and commutative algebras over k and <m> \mathrm { S } : \mathrm { V e c t } _ { \mathrm { K } } \to \mathrm { C a l g } , \ \mathrm { V } \mapsto \oplus _ { i \geq 0 } ( \mathrm { V } ^ { \otimes i } ) _ { \Sigma _ i } </m> the free commutative algebra functor with its canonical augmentation . if the field k has char . 0 , we have a canonical isomorphism <m> ( \mathrm { V } ^ { \otimes i } ) _ { \Sigma _ i } \cong ( \mathrm { V } ^ { \otimes i } ) ^ { \Sigma _ i } </m> of k-vector spaces and so a canonical isomorphism <m> \mathrm { S } ( \mathrm { V } ) \cong \mathrm { R } ( \mathrm { V } ) </m> of k-vector spaces that makes <m> \mathrm { S } ( \mathrm { V } ) </m> to a commutative and cocommutative bialgebra . my question is : does this generalize to <m> \infty </m> - categories in the following sense ? let <m> \mathcal { C } </m> be a stable presentable symmetric monoidal <m> \infty </m> - category . then one has <m> \infty </m> - categories <m> \mathrm { C a l g } ( \mathcal { C } ) ^ \mathrm { } </m> and <m> \mathrm { C o c o a l g } ( \mathcal { C } ) ^ \mathrm { } : = ( \mathrm { C a l g } ( \mathcal { C ^ \mathrm { o p } } ) ^ \mathrm { } ) ^ \mathrm { o p } </m> of augmented , associative and commutative algebras respectively of coaugmented , coassociative and cocommutative coalgebras and one can define conilpotent coalgebras in the following way : the forgetful functor <m> \psi : \mathrm { C o c o a l g } ( \mathcal { C } ) ^ \mathrm { } \to \mathcal { C } </m> that takes the cokernel of the coaugmentation admits a unique section <m> \mathrm { E } : \mathcal { C } \to \mathrm { C o c o a l g } ( \mathcal { C } ) ^ \mathrm { } </m> that sends an object <m> \mathrm { X } </m> of <m> \mathcal { C } </m> to its co-square-zero extension , whose coaugmentation has cocernel <m> \mathrm { X } </m> with 0-comultiplication <m> 0 : \mathrm { X } \to \mathrm { X } \otimes \mathrm { X } . </m> denote <m> \mathrm { C o c o a l g } ( \mathcal { C } ) ^ \mathrm { c o n i l } </m> the smallest full subcategory of <m> \mathrm { C o c o a l g } ( \mathcal { C } ) ^ \mathrm { } </m> that contains the essential image of <m> \mathrm { E } </m> and closed under small colimits . <m> \mathrm { C o c o a l g } ( \mathcal { C } ) ^ \mathrm { c o n i l } \subset \mathrm { C o c o a l g } ( \mathcal { C } ) ^ \mathrm { } </m> is a colocalization . by the adjoint functor theorem <m> \psi : \mathrm { C o c o a l g } ( \mathcal { C } ) ^ \mathrm { } \to \mathcal { C } </m> admits a right adjoint and so the restriction <m> \mathrm { C o c o a l g } ( \mathcal { C } ) ^ \mathrm { c o n i l } \to \mathcal { C } </m> of <m> \psi </m> admits a right adjoint <m> \mathrm { R } . </m> similarly one defines <m> \mathrm { C o a l g } ( \mathcal { C } ) ^ \mathrm { c o n i l } </m> and shows that the forgetful functor <m> \mathrm { C o a l g } ( \mathcal { C } ) ^ \mathrm { c o n i l } \to \mathcal { C } </m> admits a right adjoint <m> \mathrm { T } . </m>
given a cardinal number <m> \aleph _ \alpha </m> , is it known whether or not <m> \aleph _ \alpha = \beth _ \alpha </m> is independent of zfc ? one could define <m> \mathrm { C H } ( \aleph _ \alpha ) </m> as <m> \aleph _ \alpha = \beth _ \alpha </m> . for which cardinals is it true that <m> \mathrm { Z F C } \models \mathrm { C H ( \kappa ) } </m> ? clearly , <m> \mathrm { Z F C } \models \mathrm { C H } ( \aleph _ 0 ) </m> , and <m> \mathrm { C H } ( \aleph _ 1 ) </m> is equivalent to <m> \mathrm { C H } </m> -LRB- and is thus independent of zfc -RRB- . because <m> \mathrm { G C H } </m> is indepenedent of zfc , <m> \neg \mathrm { C H } ( \kappa ) </m> can not be proven for any cardinal <m> \kappa </m> . if <m> \mathrm { Z F C } \models \mathrm { C H } ( \aleph _ { \alpha + 1 } ) </m> , then <m> \aleph _ { \alpha + 1 } = \beth _ { \alpha + 1 } </m> . thus , if we assume <m> \aleph _ \alpha < \beth _ \alpha </m> , we get a contradiction , because <m> \aleph _ \alpha < \beth _ \alpha </m> and then <m> \aleph _ { \alpha + 1 } < \beth _ { \alpha + 1 } </m> . so , if <m> \mathrm { C H } ( \kappa ^ + ) </m> is provable , then <m> \mathrm { C H } ( \kappa ) </m> is also provable . thus , for cardinals <m> \kappa < \aleph _ \omega </m> , <m> \mathrm { C H } ( \kappa ) </m> is independent of zfc . it is known that <m> \alpha \leq \aleph _ \alpha </m> , and thus if <m> \beth _ \kappa = \kappa </m> then <m> \aleph _ \kappa = \kappa </m> -LRB- i.e. all <m> \beth </m> - fixed points are also <m> \aleph </m> - fixed points -RRB- . therefore , <m> \beth _ \kappa = \aleph _ \kappa = \kappa </m> , and <m> \beth _ \kappa = \aleph _ \kappa </m> . so , for all <m> \beth </m> - fixed points <m> \kappa </m> , <m> \mathrm { C H } ( \kappa ) </m> is provable from zfc . are there any other known <m> \kappa </m> with <m> \mathrm { C H } ( \kappa ) </m> independent of zfc ? is <m> \exists \kappa \neq \aleph _ 0 ( \mathrm { C H } ( \kappa ) ) </m> independent of zfc ? -LRB- if so , <m> \beth </m> fixed points are independent of zfc as well . -RRB- edit : of course <m> \beth </m> - fixed points are not independent of zfc , they do exist by <m> \alpha \mapsto \beth _ \alpha </m> being a normal function . so , zfc actually proves the existence of cardinals larger than <m> \aleph _ 0 </m> which fulfill gch .
disclaimer : i have asked this question on physics se a week ago , but got no answers . i know that some mo users are interested in the <m> n </m> - body problem , so i decided to cross post here as well . consider the <m> n </m> - body problem where we are interested in describing the time evolution of <m> n </m> masses interacting through a potential <m> U </m> . let <m> D </m> be the matrix containing all pairwise distances between our masses ; i.e. <m> D _ { i j } = \sqrt { ( x _ i - x _ j ) ^ 2 + ( y _ i - y _ j ) ^ 2 + ( z _ i - z _ j ) ^ 2 } </m> where <m> x _ i , y _ i , z _ i </m> are the cartesian coordinates of the <m> i </m> ` th mass . assume that <m> U </m> only depends on <m> D </m> , and not individual positions . -LSB- 1 -RSB- i am interested in finding a differential equation that describes the time evolution of <m> D </m> , without individual positions appearing in it . is it possible to formulate such an equation in classical mechanics ? -LSB- 1 -RSB- this is indeed true for newton 's law of gravitation , but it need not hold for a generic potential .
can you have <m> \infty </m> - forms on infinite-dimensional manifolds or elsewhere and what are they used for ?
i just heard a this american life episode which recounted the famous anecdote about frank nelson cole factoring <m> N : = 2 ^ { 6 7 } - 1 </m> as <m> 1 9 3 { , } 7 0 7 { , } 7 2 1 \times 7 6 1 { , } 8 3 8 { , } 2 5 7 { , } 2 8 7 </m> . there does n't seem to be a historical record of how cole achieved this ; all we have i could find his statement that it took `` three years of sundays '' . ira glass 's guest , paul hoffman , suggests that this was done by trial division . but this is nuts , unless i am missing something . three years of sundays is <m> 1 5 6 </m> days . if he works <m> 1 0 </m> hours a day , that 's <m> 9 3 { , } 6 0 0 </m> minutes . there are <m> 1 0 { , } 7 4 9 { , } 6 9 2 </m> primes up to <m> 1 9 3 { , } 7 0 7 { , } 7 2 1 </m> . so that is more than <m> 1 0 0 </m> trial divisions a minute . worse than that , existing prime tables did n't go high enough : according to chapter xiii of dickson 's history of the theory of numbers , existing tables of primes only ran to something like <m> 1 0 { , } 0 0 0 { , } 0 0 0 </m> -LRB- <m> 6 6 4 { , } 5 7 9 </m> primes -RRB- , so for the vast majority of the trial divisions , he 'd have to find the primes first . -LRB- lehmer , in 1914 , went up to <m> 1 0 { , } 0 0 6 { , } 7 2 1 </m> . -RRB- but i 'm puzzled thinking what else cole could have done . i skimmed chapter xiv in dickson . the methods which seem to have existed at the time are :
in 1977 , joan plastiras gave a striking example of two non <m> * </m> - isomorphic c <m> ^ * </m> - algebras <m> \mathcal A </m> and <m> \mathcal B </m> such that <m> \mathcal A \otimes M _ 2 ( \mathbb C ) \simeq \mathcal B \otimes M _ 2 ( \mathbb C ) </m> -LRB- http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1977-066-02/s0002-9939-1977-0461158-9/s0002-9939-1977-0461158-9.pdf -RRB- . my question is this : can you find two non <m> * </m> - isomorphic c <m> ^ * </m> - algebras <m> \mathcal A , \mathcal B </m> such that <m> \mathcal A \otimes M _ n ( \mathbb C ) \simeq \mathcal B \otimes M _ n ( \mathbb C ) , \ n = 2 , 3 ? </m> note that plastiras ' example does not satisfy this condition . furthermore , can you find non <m> * </m> - isomorphic <m> \mathcal A , \mathcal B </m> such that <m> \mathcal A \otimes M _ n ( \mathbb C ) \simeq \mathcal B \otimes M _ n ( \mathbb C ) , \ \forall n \geq 2 </m> or does this condition imply that <m> \mathcal A \simeq \mathcal B </m> ?
mathworld just says that the lower central series terminates : <m> \mathfrak { g } _ 1 = [ \mathfrak { g } , \mathfrak { g } ] </m> , <m> \mathfrak { g } _ 2 = [ \mathfrak { g } , \mathfrak { g } _ 1 ] </m> and <m> \mathfrak { g } _ n = [ \mathfrak { g } , \mathfrak { g } _ { n - 1 } ] </m> the best example i could think of is something like : <m> \left ( \begin {array} { c c c c } 1 & \mathbb { R } & \mathbb { R } & \mathbb { R } \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \mathbb { R } \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end {array} \right ) </m> another question on here says all simply connected nilpotent lie groups are matrix groups . it was phrased in a difficult way , so i am asking it again . for example , another arrangement of <m> \mathbb { R } </m> 's that i can think of -LRB- at least in a <m> 4 \times 4 </m> matrix -RRB- could be : <m> \left ( \begin {array} { c c c c } 1 & 0 & \mathbb { R } & \mathbb { R } \\ 0 & 1 & \mathbb { R } & \mathbb { R } \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end {array} \right ) </m> and i think there is only one more in the <m> 5 \times 5 </m> case : <m> \left ( \begin {array} { c c c c c } 1 & \mathbb { R } & \mathbb { R } & \mathbb { R } & \mathbb { R } \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end {array} \right ) </m> so in other words , i am claiming -LRB- almost surely false -RRB- an identification with nilpotent lie algebras and ferrers boards -LRB- integer partitions rrrr
in exercise 153 of my list , it is proved that the connected components <m> S O _ 2 ( { \mathbb R } ) </m> and <m> O _ 2 ^ - ( { \mathbb R } ) </m> of the orthogonal group are linked as curves in the three-dimensional sphere defined by <m> \| M \| = 1 </m> in the operator norm . question . consider the case of <m> n \times n </m> matrices . the real orthogonal group has two connected components <m> S O _ n ( { \mathbb R } ) </m> and <m> O _ n ^ - ( { \mathbb R } ) </m> , each one a submanifold of dimension <m> n ( n - 1 ) / 2 </m> . let <m> s _ 1 ( M ) \ge \cdots \ge s _ n ( M ) ( \ge 0 ) </m> be the singular values of a matrix <m> M </m> . we have <m> s _ 1 ( M ) = \| M \| </m> . define the set <m> V _ n </m> by the identities <m> s _ 1 ( M ) = \cdots = s _ { n - 1 } ( M ) = 1 </m> . is it a submanifold of dimension <m> n ^ 2 - n + 1 </m> ? in <m> V _ n </m> , are <m> S O _ n ( { \mathbb R } ) </m> and <m> O _ n ^ - ( { \mathbb R } ) </m> linked ? nota . the exercise in <m> M _ 2 ( { \mathbb R } ) </m> is included in the forthcoming second edition of my book `` matrices '' as exercise 21 in chapter 10 .
suppose the continuum is larger than <m> \aleph _ 2 </m> . does there exist a countably closed notion of forcing that collapses <m> \aleph _ 2 </m> to <m> \aleph _ 1 </m> , but does not collapse the continuum to <m> \aleph _ 1 </m> ? moreover , does there exist such a forcing notion that is separative and has size continuum ? it is known -LRB- see below -RRB- that the canonical collapse coll <m> ( \aleph _ 1 , \aleph _ 2 ) </m> collapses the continuum . trying something like the canonical collapse relativized to some inner model will fail to answer the question , because this forcing will not be countably closed in v.
i want to know if there is a <m> \sigma </m> - algebra such that for every countable ordinal <m> \alpha </m> the <m> \sigma </m> - algebra can be generated in more than <m> \alpha </m> steps but less than <m> \omega _ { 1 } </m> steps . given an algebra of sets <m> ( X , \mathcal { A } ) </m> , let <m> \mathcal { A } _ { 0 } = \mathcal { A } </m> , and for all ordinals <m> 0 < \alpha \leq \omega _ { 1 } </m> , let <m> \mathcal { A } _ { \alpha } </m> be the algebra of sets generated by countable unions from the collection <m> \bigcup _ { \beta < \alpha } \mathcal { A } _ { \beta } </m> . clearly <m> \mathcal { A } _ { \omega _ { 1 } } </m> is the <m> \sigma </m> - algebra generated by <m> \mathcal { A } </m> .
can we have positive reals <m> x , y , z </m> with <m> x ^ { \left ( y ^ z \right ) } = y ^ { \left ( z ^ x \right ) } = z ^ { \left ( x ^ y \right ) } </m> in cyclic permutation , other than the line <m> x = y = z </m> ? i put this at https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/493739/this-is-stupid-but-i-have-a-bad-cold-with-cough and one poor guy has been hacking away at it . i still have no idea . i would love to see some representation of the supposed surface <m> x ^ { \left ( y ^ z \right ) } = y ^ { \left ( z ^ x \right ) } , </m> which i feel really ought to be some ugly variant of the helicoid around the line <m> x = y = z </m> . edit , thursday : is it true that the gradient of <m> \color { magenta } { h ( x , y , z ) = x ^ { \left ( y ^ z \right ) } - y ^ { \left ( z ^ x \right ) } } , </m> is defined and a nonzero vector along the line , say , at the point <m> x = y = z = t </m> for positive real <m> t ? </m> if so , the surface is orthogonal to that at the line ... further , if you switch to one of the other pairs as a difference , i expect the gradient vector to be rotated by <m> 1 2 0 ^ \circ ; </m> this gives a pretty good reason for there being no other points on all three such surfaces near the known line .
assume that we have a matrix product of form <m> B = A _ { n \times m } D _ { m \times m } A ^ T _ { m \times n } + \alpha I _ { n \times n } </m> . <m> D </m> is a positive diagonal matrix , <m> I </m> is identity matrix , <m> \alpha > 0 </m> and <m> m < n </m> . is there any relation between <m> | B | </m> , <m> | A A ^ T | </m> , <m> | D | </m> and <m> | I | </m> or their logarithms , in the form of an equality or an inequality ?
i 've been trying to understand radin forcing and some of its applications , one of which is the use of it to prove the consistency of `` club filter of <m> \omega _ 1 </m> is an ultrafilter + zf + dc '' . however , mitchell 's proof in the paper `` how weak is a closed unbounded ultrafilter '' in logic 80 ' is a bit difficult to read . so this question is really asking for a potential outline from those who are familiar with this so i could try to recover the proof myself . thinking about this , the following is the big picture i had in mind -LRB- there are a few uncertainties and maybe mistakes i 'm not aware of -RRB- : start with a coherent measure sequence on <m> \kappa </m> , i.e. <m> \bar { U } </m> -LRB- so <m> o r d ( \bar { U } ) = \kappa </m> -RRB- such that <m> U ( 0 ) = \kappa </m> <m> U ( 1 ) </m> is a normal ultrafilter on <m> \kappa </m> , and for <m> 2 < \alpha < l e n g t h ( \bar { U } ) U ( \alpha ) </m> is an ultrafilter on <m> V _ \kappa </m> satisfying the coherence property : <m> [ i d ] _ { U ( \alpha ) } = \bar { U } \restriction \alpha </m> in <m> U l t ( V , U ( \alpha ) ) </m> . radin poset with respect to <m> \bar { U } </m> is <m> \mathbb { R } _ { \bar { U } } </m> consisting of finite sequences <m> p = ( ( \bar { V _ 0 } , A _ 0 ) , \cdots , ( \bar { V _ n } , A _ n ) ) </m> such that <m> A _ i \in \bigcap \bar { V } _ i </m> and <m> \bar { V } _ n = \bar { U } </m> and <m> o r d ( \bar { V } _ 0 ) < \cdots < o r d ( \bar { V } _ n ) </m> . now we say <m> p < q </m> if 1 -RRB- each <m> ( \bar { V } , B ) </m> appearing in <m> q </m> , there is some <m> A \subset B </m> such that <m> ( \bar { V } , A ) </m> appears in <m> p </m> ; 2 -RRB- for each <m> ( \bar { V } , B ) </m> appearing in <m> p </m> but not in <m> q </m> let <m> ( \bar { U } , A ) </m> be the pair appearing in <m> q </m> such that <m> o r d ( \bar { U } ) </m> is the smallest greater than <m> o r d ( \bar { V } ) </m> , then <m> \bar { V } \in A </m> and <m> B \subset A </m> . say <m> \gamma </m> is a repeat point if <m> \forall A \forall \beta A \in U ( \beta ) \Rightarrow \exists \gamma ' < \gamma A \in U ( \gamma ' ) </m> . it is well known that when forcing with a measure sequence that has a repeat point , the measurability of <m> \kappa </m> is preserved . now to get the desired model for `` club filter of <m> \omega _ 1 </m> is an ultrafilter + zf + dc '' , assume that there are at least <m> \kappa ^ + </m> many repeat points for <m> \bar { U } </m> , say <m> \eta _ \nu : \nu < \kappa ^ + </m> . i want to iterate radin forcing <m> \kappa ^ + </m> many times and then followed by a lévy collapse . the rough goal is that in the final model each subset of <m> \kappa </m> appears at some intermediate stage , then the radin forcing adds a club that is either almost contained in it or its complement , so then the radin clubs do form an ultrafilter . is there an explanation of the mitchell 's original argument that is more in the fashion of iterated forcing ? or more specifically , do i use <m> \mathbb { R } _ { \bar { U } \restriction \eta _ \nu } </m> to add a club at stage <m> \nu </m> ? but this must damage some repeats points in the original measure sequence -LRB- since we need <m> \kappa ^ + </m> many -RRB- . for example in forcing extension with respect to <m> \mathbb { R } _ { \bar { U } \restriction \eta _ \nu } </m> , is <m> \eta _ \nu </m> still a repeat point and also <m> \eta _ \mu , \mu > \nu </m> ? -LSB- feel free to close it if the question is ambiguous , but i really had a hard time understanding mitchell 's argument -RSB- .
i can show that the sum of <m> \omega ( j ) </m> over all <m> j \leq n </m> is <m> n l o g l o g n + b n + O ( \frac { n } { l o g n } </m> -RRB- . however , what i need is that <m> \sum ( \omega ( j ) - l o g l o g n ) ^ 2 </m> with sum over all <m> j \leq n = </m> o <m> ( n l o g l o g n ) </m> . can anyone provide a route to the solution ? it 'll be highly appreciated .

i am currently thinking about a physics model related to framed bordism <m> \Omega _ 3 ^ { f r } = \mathbb { Z } / 2 4 = \pi ^ s _ 3 </m> , and the first stable example is <m> \pi _ 8 ( S ^ 5 ) </m> , so i was curious about the generator , and happened to see <m> \pi _ 8 ( S O ( 6 ) ) = \mathbb { Z } / 2 4 </m> as well . so my question is : is there a homomorphism sending <m> \pi _ 8 ( S O ( 6 ) ) </m> to <m> \pi _ 8 ( S ^ 5 ) </m> ? more generally , what 's the relation between homotopy groups <m> \pi _ n ( S ^ m ) </m> and <m> \pi _ n ( S O ( m + 1 ) ) </m> in general ?

one of the main players in the categorical geometric langlands correspondence is the moduli stack of rank n integrable connections on a complex curve . the reason for considering such objects is that they are the de rham analogue of lisse <m> \ell </m> - adic sheaves , which have an obvious galois interpretation . i have read in many places that there is no moduli stack of lisse <m> \ell </m> - adic sheaves on a curve over a finite field , making the naive <m> \ell </m> - adic formulation of the categorical geometric langlands correspondence problematic . i have two questions
when students are first learning about groups , a classic example of a group that is not defined as a set of functions is the group whose underlying set is <m> \mathbb { R } \setminus - 1 </m> , and whose operation is <m> x * y = x + y + x y </m> . this naturally leads one to wonder about what other polynomials in two variables give rise to a group law on <m> \mathbb { R } </m> . is there any nice criteria for such polynomials , or , in the case that there is not , are there any nice classes of polynomials that are group laws ?
i 'm working on a proof-checker that can verify termination proofs . the fundamental method it provides for constructing such proofs is to translate the program into primitive recursion . basically , i provide a combinator <m> \rho </m> typed as : <m> \rho : \forall A , B : ( A \rightarrow N a t \rightarrow A ) \rightarrow ( A \rightarrow B ) \rightarrow A \rightarrow N a t \rightarrow B </m> which , in the notation defined here , constructs <m> h </m> given <m> f </m> and <m> g </m> . although the term language contains a fixed-point combinator and is therefore turing-complete , terms that use it have a `` tentative '' flag in their type that indicate this . the <m> \rho </m> combinator and the fixed-point combinator are the only two language primitives that allow for recursion or looping of any sort -LRB- i.e. , without either of these two combinators , all you 've got is a finite-state machine -RRB- . therefore , all terms that are well-typed and non-tentatively typed are primitive recursive . what i 'm wondering is if there are any interesting complexity classes that you can build by starting with primitive-recursive constructions , and adding a finite number of other functions <m> N a t \rightarrow N a t </m> , each of which is in r but not in pr , and allowing composition with these functions . it 's easy to come up with non-interesting examples of such classes , e.g. `` primitive recursion plus the ackermann function '' , but i 'm looking for any that have sufficiently interesting properties that it would be worth adding the functions which characterize them as admitted axioms in the proof system .
my question is regarding elkies ' paper on `` the existence of infinitely many supersingular primes for every elliptic curve over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> '' . in the section `` nuts and bolts '' , elkies has the following proposition :

let <m> M </m> be an object in an <m> k </m> - linear abelian category with enough projectives . then one can construct an <m> A _ \infty </m> - structure on the ext algebra <m> E x t ^ \bullet ( M , M ) </m> as follows : one chooses projective resolution <m> P \rightarrow M </m> and forms the hom complex <m> H o m ^ \bullet ( P , P ) </m> now the cohomology of this complex is the ext algebra and in the case where <m> k </m> is a field , one can choose a `` homotopy retraction '' <m> E x t ^ \bullet ( M , M ) \rightarrow H o m ^ \bullet ( P , P ) </m> and transfer the dg-algebra structure on <m> H o m ^ \bullet ( P , P ) </m> along it . my questions are :
consider <m> S L _ 2 </m> embedded into <m> S L _ 3 </m> as upper left block matrices . the quotient <m> S L _ 3 / S L _ 2 </m> is an affine variety , as is any quotient of reductive groups . how does one describe <m> S L _ 3 / S L _ 2 </m> ? what are the equations for it in some affine space ? -LRB- one can also pose the same question more generally for <m> S L _ { n } / S L _ { n - 1 } </m> . -RRB-

not sure if this belongs to mo or not . are there any lower bound on radical of <m> 2 ^ n \pm 1 </m> ? we recall that radical of an integer <m> r a d ( k ) </m> is a product of primes which divide <m> k </m> . as an example , if the abc-conjecture is true in the form <m> m a x ( | a | , | b | , | c | ) \leq r a d ( a b c ) ^ 2 </m> then <m> r a d ( 2 ^ n \pm 1 ) \geq 2 ^ { n / 2 - 1 } . </m> i wonder if this estimate is proven -LRB- or perhaps conjectured -RRB- by anyone ? are there any nontrivial results here ?

i accidentally posted this question to math.stackexchange but think that it is more appropriate here -LRB- if not , please say so ! -RRB- : this question is from neukirch 's book `` algebraic number theory , '' page 305 , exercise 3 . the needed notation is quite heavy so i 'm therefore including a separate section on notation . notation for the problem let <m> G </m> be a profinite <m> p </m> - group -LRB- so all quotients by open subgroups are <m> p </m> - groups -RRB- . we will denote the closed subgroups of <m> G </m> by <m> G _ K </m> and call the indices <m> K </m> for fields . we say that <m> K </m> is the fixed field of <m> G _ K . </m> we write <m> K \subset L </m> if <m> G _ L \subset G _ K </m> and we call <m> K \subset L </m> a field extension . we say that it is a finite extension if <m> G _ L </m> is of finite index in <m> G _ K </m> and we say that it is galois if <m> G _ L </m> is normal in <m> G _ K </m> and then we write <m> G ( L | K ) = G _ K / G _ L . </m> we call this the galois group of <m> K \subset L . </m> further , let us say that we have a continuous multiplicative <m> G </m> - module <m> A . </m> we mean with this a multiplicative abelian group <m> A </m> on which <m> \sigma \in G </m> act as automorphisms on the right and they act continuously . we let <m> A _ K = \{ a \in A | a ^ \sigma = a , \forall \sigma \in G _ K \} . </m> clearly we then have that <m> A _ K \subset A _ L </m> for any field extension <m> K \subset L . </m> if <m> K \subset L </m> is finite , then we have a norm map <m> N _ { L | K } : A _ L \rightarrow A _ K , </m> <m> N _ { L | K } ( a ) = \Pi _ \sigma a ^ \sigma </m> where <m> \sigma </m> varies over a system of representatives of <m> G _ K / G _ L . </m> now , suppose further that we have a surjective map <m> d : G \rightarrow \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> where <m> p </m> is a prime number . we also suppose we have a map <m> v : A _ k \rightarrow \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> which we call a henselian <m> p </m> - valuation with respect to <m> d </m> and assume that <m> v </m> satisfies the following properties :

the right-hand side of the well known equation : <m> \displaystyle \pi ^ \frac { - s } { 2 } \, \Gamma \left ( \frac { s } { 2 } \right ) \, \zeta ( s ) = \int _ 1 ^ { \infty } \left ( { x } ^ { \frac { s } { 2 } } + { x } ^ { \frac { 1 - s } { 2 } } \right ) \, \frac { \psi ( x ) } { x } \text { d } x - \frac { 1 } { s \, ( 1 - s ) } </m> with <m> \displaystyle \psi ( x ) = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } e ^ { - \pi \, n ^ 2 \, x } </m> , can be decomposed as <m> A ( s ) + A ( 1 - s ) </m> when : <m> A ( s ) : = \int _ 1 ^ { \infty } \frac { { x } ^ { \frac { s } { 2 } } \, \psi ( x ) } { x } \text { d } x - \frac { 1 } { s } </m> note that <m> A ( s ) = \overline { A ( \overline { s } ) } </m> and the reflection formula is <m> A ( s ) = \pi ^ \frac { - s } { 2 } \, \Gamma \left ( \frac { s } { 2 } \right ) \, \zeta ( s ) - A ( 1 - s ) </m> . this implies that when <m> s = \rho </m> , it follows that <m> A ( \rho ) = - A ( 1 - \rho ) </m> . <m> A ( s ) </m> also has complex roots , that seem to increase quite regularly -LRB- truncated at 3 decimals -RRB- : <m> 1 5 . 8 0 9 \pm 1 1 . 8 4 8 \, i , 1 9 . 5 7 4 \pm 1 9 . 2 4 0 \, i , 2 2 . 6 6 0 \pm 2 5 . 5 3 6 \, i , 2 5 . 3 6 4 \pm 3 1 . 2 6 3 \, i , 2 7 . 8 1 5 \pm 3 6 . 6 2 1 \, i , 3 0 . 0 8 3 \pm 4 1 . 7 1 3 \, i , 3 2 . 2 1 0 \pm 4 6 . 6 0 0 \, i , 3 4 . 2 2 4 \pm 5 1 . 3 2 2 \, i , 3 6 . 1 4 5 \pm 5 5 . 9 0 7 \, i , 3 7 . 9 8 8 \pm 6 0 . 3 7 7 \, i , 3 9 . 7 6 3 \pm 6 4 . 7 4 2 \, i , 4 1 . 4 8 0 \pm 6 9 . 0 2 7 \, i , 4 3 . 1 4 5 \pm 7 3 . 2 3 0 \, i , 4 4 . 7 6 6 + 7 7 . 5 5 2 \, i , 4 6 . 3 7 5 \pm 8 1 . 2 8 6 \, i , 4 7 . 5 1 1 \pm 8 4 . 4 1 5 \, i , \dots </m> note that since these zeros seem to grow increasingly further away from the critical strip , it follows from the reflection formula above -LRB- <m> \rho </m> 's exist only in the strip -RRB- that <m> A ( s ) \ne A ( 1 - s ) </m> at these zeros . question : is anything known about these zeros ? have these been studied before ?
let <m> S </m> be a noetherian excellent regular scheme and <m> U \subset S </m> an everywhere dense open of codimension <m> \geq 2 </m> . for some fibered categories of geometric objects , it makes sense to ask whether the restriction functor from <m> S </m> to <m> U </m> is an equivalence of categories . if this is the case , we say that the fibered category is pure -LRB- terminology coming initially from zariski-nagata 's theorem on the purity of the ramification locus -RRB- . the case of abelian schemes is particularly interesting . suppose first that all points of <m> S </m> are of residual characteristic <m> 0 </m> . then grothendieck proved in `` un théorème sur les homomorphismes des schémas abéliens '' -LRB- inventiones mathematicae 1966/67 , volume 2 , issue 1 , pp 59-78 -RRB- that the category of abelian schemes satisfies purity -LRB- corollaire 4.5 -RRB- . he then went on to ask -LRB- in paragraph 4.8 -RRB- whether it is possible that this result remains true up to <m> p </m> - isogeny in characteristic <m> p </m> -LRB- the <m> p </m> - isogeny is necessary , as i will explain shortly -RRB- . my question is the following : has there been progress on this question since ? more generally , in the general situation above , if <m> A </m> is an abelian scheme over <m> U </m> , does there exists an abelian scheme <m> B </m> over <m> S </m> and an isogeny <m> B _ U \rightarrow A </m> over <m> U </m> -LRB- ideally of degree divisible only by residual characteristics of <m> S </m> -RRB- ? . state of the literature : the problem of extending <m> A </m> to <m> S </m> `` on the nose '' has been intensely studied . in the same paper -LRB- section 4.6 -RRB- , grothedieck provides a simple example of an abelian scheme over <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 2 _ k \setminus \{ 0 \} </m> for <m> k </m> algebraically closed of positive characteristic not extending to <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 2 _ k </m> . later , gabber-raynaud-oort provided similar but more sophisticated examples over some regular local rings of mixed characteristic of dimension <m> 2 </m> -LRB- described in de jong-oort , `` on extending families of curves '' , journal of algebraic geometry , 6 -LRB- 1997 -RRB- , pp. 545 -- 562 , paragraph 6 -RRB- . edit : the counter-examples can chosen to be principally polarized . in mixed characteristic local rings with low ramification , there is nevertheless a positive result due to vasiu-zink -LRB- theorem 3 , corollary 5 in `` purity results for p-divisible groups and abelian schemes over regular bases of mixed characteristic '' , preprint -RRB- . the same paper constructs many new counter-examples -LRB- lemma 27 , theorem 28 -RRB- . as far as i can see , the counter-examples above are isogeneous to abelian schemes that do extend , so they do not answer my question . let me mention for completeness that the similar problem for curves has a much more satisfactory answer : purity is true for smooth projective <m> n </m> - pointed curves of genus <m> g </m> when <m> 2 - 2 g - n < 0 </m> -LRB- moret-bailly , c. r. acad . sci . paris , 300 n ° 14 -LRB- 1985 -RRB- , 489 -- 492 . -RRB- , for stable curves of constant topological type -LRB- the de jong-oort paper above -RRB- . even better , families of smooth projective curves with <m> 2 - 2 g - n < 0 </m> are controlled by the étale fundamental group on normal base schemes -LRB- stix , `` a monodromy criterion for extending curves '' , int math res notices -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 2005 -LRB- 29 -RRB- : 1787-1802 . -RRB- .

this question has practical meanings in algebraic attack of stream ciphers in cryptography . it can be stated as follows : suppose <m> V </m> is a <m> n </m> dimensional vector space over the field <m> F _ 2 </m> , where <m> F _ 2 </m> is the simplest finite field contains only <m> \{ 0 , 1 \} </m> . you can take <m> V </m> to be <m> F _ 2 ^ n </m> . <m> S </m> be a subset of <m> V </m> . the question is , what is the minimum of the size of <m> S </m> such that <m> S </m> must contain some <m> k </m> dimensional linear sub-manifold <m> M </m> of <m> V </m> , where <m> k </m> is a given positive integer below <m> n </m> ? here by a linear sub-manifold <m> M </m> of dimension <m> k </m> , we mean that <m> M </m> can be expressed as <m> M = \{ x + W \} </m> , where <m> x </m> is a fixed vector in <m> V </m> and <m> W </m> is a <m> k </m> dimensional subspace of <m> V </m> . it 's obvious that <m> | S | > 2 ^ k </m> ， since any sub-manifold of dimension <m> k </m> contains exactly <m> 2 ^ k </m> points but there are subsets of size <m> 2 ^ k </m> that are not submanifolds . i think this problem must has been considered by combinatorists , but i did n't find it in any standard textbooks on combinatorics .
question : given the long and skinny matrix <m> A \in \mathbb { R } ^ { m \times n } </m> with <m> m \ge n </m> , define the matrix valued operator <m> \mathcal { A } : X \mapsto A X ^ { T } + X A ^ { T } . </m> what is the tightest nontrivial lower-bound on the singular value <m> \sigma _ { \min } ( \mathcal { A } ) \triangleq \min _ { X } \{ \| \mathcal { A } ( X ) \| _ { F } : \| X \| _ { F } = 1 \} , </m> where <m> \| X \| _ { F } ^ { 2 } = \mathrm { t r a c e } ( X ^ { T } X ) </m> is the usual matrix euclidean norm -LRB- i.e. frobenius norm -RRB- ? remark 1 . in the case that <m> A = a </m> is a vector -LRB- i.e. with <m> n = 1 </m> -RRB- , it is easy to show that <m> \sigma _ { \min } ( \mathcal { A } ) = \sqrt { 2 } \| a \| </m> , since <m> \| a x ^ { T } + x a ^ { T } \| ^ { 2 } = 2 \| a \| ^ { 2 } \| x \| ^ { 2 } + 2 ( a ^ { T } x ) ^ { 2 } </m> , and the term <m> ( a ^ { T } x ) ^ { 2 } </m> is obviously nonnegative . however in the general matrix case , we have <m> \| A X ^ { T } + X A ^ { T } \| ^ { 2 } = 2 \| A X ^ { T } \| _ { F } ^ { 2 } + 2 \mathrm { t r a c e } [ ( A ^ { T } X ) ^ { 2 } ] </m> , and it appears possible for <m> \mathrm { t r a c e } [ ( A ^ { T } X ) ^ { 2 } ] </m> to be negative . remark 2 . in the case that <m> A </m> is square and that <m> X </m> is forced to be symmetric , this problem is closely related to the smallest singular value of the lyapunov operator <m> A \otimes I + I \otimes A </m> , which is known to be related -LRB- in a fairly complicated way -RRB- to the singular values of <m> P </m> , where <m> P </m> solves <m> A P + P A ^ { T } = I </m> . edit 1 . federico poloni remarked that the rectangular case should not be easier than the square one . agreed . in this case , consider where <m> n </m> is very small , say 1 or 2 , or at least <m> n \ll m / 2 , </m> so that <m> \mathcal { A } ( X ) </m> can be considered low-rank . as mentioned above , the <m> n = 1 </m> case has an exact solution . can tight bounds be derived for <m> n </m> small ?
let <m> P </m> be a <m> p </m> - group . it is known that if <m> E </m> is a maximal elementary abelian subgroup of rank 2 in <m> P </m> , then <m> C _ P ( E ) / E </m> is cyclic where <m> C _ P ( E ) </m> denotes the centralizer of <m> E </m> in <m> P </m> . this is proved , for example , in the paper by jon carlson and jacques thevenaz on the endotrivial modules . i wonder if there is such a general result for any elementary abelian subgroup ?
let <m> u \in H ^ 1 ( ( 0 , T ) \times S ) </m> be the unique solution of <m> u _ { t t } + \Delta u = 0 </m> <m> u | _ { t = 0 } = u _ 0 </m> <m> u | _ { t = T } = 0 </m> where <m> u _ 0 \in H ^ { \frac 1 2 } ( S ) </m> and <m> S </m> is some euclidean hypersurface without boundary -LRB- eg . unit sphere -RRB- . the weak formulation satisfied is <m> \int _ 0 ^ T \int _ S u _ t v _ t + \nabla u \nabla v = 0 </m> for each <m> v \in H ^ 1 ( ( 0 , T ) \times S ) </m> such that <m> v | _ { t = 0 } = v | _ { t = T } = 0 </m> .
consider <m> \mathcal { M } _ { 0 , n } </m> , the moduli space of genus zero curves with <m> n </m> - punctures . using a combination of the kodaira-spencer map , riemann-roch , and serre duality , i have calculated the dimension of <m> \mathcal { M } _ { 0 , n } </m> to be <m> n - 3 </m> . using such heavy theorems , i have lost intuition as to why adding a puncture increases the dimension of the moduli space . very roughly , using the interpretation of <m> \mathcal { M } _ { 0 , n } </m> as the configuration space of projectively equivalent <m> n </m> - tupels points in <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> , i imagine that the configuration class becomes `` finer '' as we increase the number of punctures . however , my reasoning is n't all that satisfying . why is the dimension of the moduli space increasing by exactly one for each puncture ?
is it possible to define a structure of differentiable -LRB- smooth -RRB- manifold on the hilbert cube <m> [ 0 , 1 ] ^ \mathbb { N } </m> ? has it been done in the literature ? in textbooks , only the banach case is treated , but the hilbert cube has countable dimension , and a vector space with countable dimension is not complete -LRB- although the hilbert cube is complete , because of compacity -RRB- , this is a problem for the tangent space . however , can something be done ? maybe with some restrictions ?
most well known sets in <m> \Sigma _ 1 \setminus \Delta _ 0 </m> , such as the halting problem , are complete in <m> \Sigma _ 1 </m> , relatively to the many-to-one reduction . in fact i do n't know any example of a -LRB- non recursive -RRB- set in <m> \Sigma _ 1 </m> that is not complete . is every set in <m> \Sigma _ 1 \setminus \Delta </m> complete in <m> \Sigma _ 1 </m> ?

given a homomorphism <m> \rho : S ^ 1 \rightarrow G </m> with <m> G </m> a compact lie group there is an induced map of classifying spaces <m> B \rho : B S ^ 1 \rightarrow B G </m> . what is known about the homotopy type of the mapping space <m> M a p _ { B \rho } ( B S ^ 1 , B G ) </m> ? integrally the space will be a mess of phantom maps . on the other hand , after rationalisation , <m> B G _ \mathbb { Q } </m> will be a product of even dimensional eilenberg-mac lane spaces and the mapping space too will become a similar product after one uses thom 's theorem . is there an understandable middle ground ? i have read notbohm 's work and understand that if <m> C ( \rho ) \subseteq G </m> denotes the centraliser of <m> \rho </m> in <m> G </m> , then there is a homomorphism <m> C ( \rho ) \times S ^ 1 \rightarrow G </m> and the adjoint of the map that classifies this homomorphism , <m> e _ { \rho } : B C ( \rho ) \rightarrow M a p _ { B \rho } ( B S ^ 1 , B G ) </m> , induces an isomorphism on mod p homology for any prime . is this map then not a homotopy equivalence after completion at any prime ? as an example of my lack of a thorough understanding of these concepts take <m> \rho : S ^ 1 = U ( 1 ) \rightarrow U ( 2 ) </m> to be the canonical inclusion . then <m> B C ( \rho ) = B T = B S ^ 1 \times B S ^ 1 </m> classifies a maximal torus . but on the other hand <m> M a p _ { B \rho } ( B S ^ 1 , B U ( 2 ) ) _ \mathbb { Q } \simeq M a p _ { B \rho } ( B S ^ 1 , B U ( 2 ) _ \mathbb { Q } ) \simeq K ( \mathbb { Q } , 2 ) \times K ( \mathbb { Q } , 2 ) \times K ( \mathbb { Q } , 4 ) </m> so from this i do n't understand how the map <m> e _ \rho </m> can be an equivalence of any sort . edit : the result from notbohm i quote is to be found in his paper `` maps between classifying spaces '' mathematische zeitschrift , 1991 , volume 207 , number 1 , page 153 .
consider the ring <m> W ( \mathbb { F } _ p ) </m> of big witt vectors of <m> \mathbb { F } _ p </m> . this has a natural structure of a <m> \lambda </m> - ring -LRB- in the strong sense -RRB- since rings of big witt vectors always do . <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> also has the structure of a <m> \lambda </m> - ring , given by the maps <m> \lambda ^ n ( x ) = \binom { x } { n } </m> . there is a canonical quotient map -LRB- of rings -RRB- <m> W ( \mathbb { F } _ p ) \to \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> from the big witt vectors to the classical <m> p </m> - adic witt vectors . is this a <m> \lambda </m> - ring homomorphism ? more generally , when -LRB- if ever -RRB- do we get a <m> \lambda </m> - ring structure on the smaller <m> p </m> - adic witt vectors ? i know this quotient map admits an additive section . we could potentially use this to define <m> \lambda </m> operators on the ring of <m> p </m> - adic witt vectors , but it is not clear to me that this would actually give the structure of a <m> \lambda </m> - ring . and in my particular case , it is unclear if this would agree with the <m> \lambda </m> - ring structure i already have .
let <m> ( M , g ) </m> be a smooth , closed riemannian manifold with dimension <m> n > 4 </m> . define the <m> Q </m> - curvature through the formula <m> Q = \Delta R + \frac { n ^ 3 - 4 n ^ 2 + 1 6 n - 1 6 } { ( n - 1 ) ( n - 2 ) ^ 2 } R ^ 2 - \frac { 8 ( n - 1 ) } { ( n - 2 ) ^ 2 } | R i c | ^ 2 , </m> where <m> \Delta = - d i v \nabla </m> , <m> R </m> is the scalar curvature , and <m> | R i c | </m> is the norm of the ricci tensor . this quantity arises in many problems in conformal differential geometry . the question is whether or not a uniform sup-norm bound on a sequence of <m> Q </m> curvatures implies there exists a uniform sup-norm bound on the corresponding scalar curvatures , provided that all of the scalar curvatures change sign ?
hello , let <m> Q </m> be a finite quiver , let <m> M </m> denote the arrow ideal and let <m> k Q </m> denote the path algebra . endow <m> k Q </m> with the <m> M </m> - adic topology . now let <m> \mathcal { A } </m> be the set of all formal series <m>  </m> where <m> \gamma </m> is a path . then <m> k Q </m> is naturally a <m> k </m> - algebra -LRB- same operations we use for a group ring -RRB- . define <m> t </m> as follows : <m> t ( \sum a _ { \gamma } \gamma ) = n </m> if <m> a _ { p } </m> is non-zero for at least one path p of length <m> n </m> and <m> a _ { q } = 0 </m> for all paths of length smaller that <m> n </m> . this induces a metric <m> ( a , b ) \mapsto 2 ^ { - t ( a - b ) } </m> , then <m> \mathcal { A } </m> becomes a topological algebra with this metric . question : why is <m> \mathcal { A } </m> isomorphic -LRB- as a topological algebra -RRB- to the completion of <m> k Q </m> endowed with the <m> M </m> - adic topology ?

i work at a four-year teaching school , where we pride ourselves on teaching pure math , proof , and a rather obsessive carefulness of work . recently i have been criticized for saying that `` let <m> x \in A </m> '' is often a good way to begin a proof of a statement about all elements of <m> A </m> . the criticism is based on the objection that <m> A </m> could be empty , in which case there is no <m> x </m> to be in <m> A </m> . the issue affects quite a lot of mathematical content , because more than half of our proofs are proofs of universal statements , and most of them begin this way . i have objected that if <m> A </m> is empty , then any universal statement <m> \forall x \in A . . . </m> is vacuously true , but people are telling me that this needs to be dealt with as a special case , or else the proof is technically incorrect , etc. . i have appealed to normal mathematical conventions , without success . our department prides itself on being more careful than normal working mathematicians . convention can do what it will , but we intend to be right ! i have appealed to serious logic , by talking about the underlying meaning of `` let <m> x \in A </m> . '' in my reading it plays a dual role of symbol introduction -LRB- `` use <m> x </m> to represent a single thing '' -RRB- and assumption -LRB- `` assume <m> x \in A </m> '' -RRB- . but these arguments have no traction -- `` our students ca n't be expected to understand clever subtleties of metalogic . '' i fear the only option remaining is to appeal to authority -- some specific authority who says this act of `` let <m> x \in A </m> '' has some sort of seal of approval . maybe such an authority is here ? from this question you might thing i work with fools , but they 're really very wonderful and intelligent people , and the sense of family here is unusually strong . like family , they drive me out of my head sometimes . probably it 's mutual . so i suppose i have two questions : 1 . am i right ? 2 . is there any hope for me to persuade my colleagues that i 'm right ? -LRB- 3 . but social advice would be welcome too . -RRB- thank you , anonymous coward
let <m> \bar M _ g </m> be the deligne-mumford compactifiction of the moduli space of complex genus <m> g </m> curves <m> M _ g </m> . is this correct that through every point of the boundary <m> \bar M _ g \setminus M _ g </m> passes a rational curve that lies in the boundary <m> \bar M _ g \setminus M _ g </m> ?
let <m> K </m> be a local field that is complete with respect to a discrete valuation . when an elliptic curve , <m> E / K </m> , has reduction type represented by the kodaira symbol <m> I _ { 2 n } ^ { * } </m> , its component group can be <m> { \mathbb Z } / 2 { \mathbb Z } \times { \mathbb Z } / 2 { \mathbb Z } </m> . in this case , is there a criterion to determine which component a point is on ? in particular , to tell if it is on the component <m> ( 1 , 0 ) </m> -LRB- or <m> ( 0 , 1 ) </m> -RRB- or on the component <m> ( 1 , 1 ) </m> ? in lemma 5.1 of silverman 's `` computing heights on elliptic curves '' , math comp . v. 51 -LRB- 1988 -RRB- , 339 -- 358 , he shows how to determine the component when we have split multiplicative reduction . ideally something like this is the sort of thing i am looking for .
my question is about a claim on the bottom of p. 121 of the book `` neron models '' by bosch , lutkebohmert , and raynaud , so i will freely use the general terminology recalled in this book , but will introduce the relevant notation here . all the references are to the book mentioned above . let <m> S </m> be a noetherian , normal , strictly henselian local domain -LRB- most of these assumptions are likely to be irrelevant for the actual question , but i 'll keep them -RRB- , let <m> X </m> be a smooth , separated , finite type <m> S </m> - scheme with <m> X \rightarrow S </m> surjective , and let <m> m \colon X \times _ S X \ -- > X </m> be an <m> S </m> - birational group law , which is assumed to be strict in the sense that there is an open subscheme <m> U \subset X \times _ S X </m> that is <m> X </m> - dense with respect to both projections and such that <m> m </m> is defined on <m> U </m> , as are the universal right and left translations <m> X \times _ S X \ -- > X \times _ S X , \quad ( x , y ) \mapsto ( x y , y ) \, X \times _ S X \ -- > X \times _ S X , \quad ( x , y ) \mapsto ( x , x y ) , </m> which are moreover required to be open immersions on <m> U </m> . all products being over <m> S </m> , let <m> \Gamma </m> be the schematic image in <m> X ^ 3 </m> of the graph of <m> m \colon U \rightarrow X </m> . as is proved in 5.3 / 3 each projection <m> q _ { i j } \colon X ^ 3 \rightarrow X ^ 2 </m> is an open immersion on <m> \Gamma </m> with the image that is <m> X </m> - dense with respect to both projections . in particular , it follows that for every <m> S </m> - scheme <m> T </m> and all <m> a , c \in X ( T ) </m> there is at most one <m> x \in X ( T ) </m> with <m> a x = c </m> . suggestively denoting such <m> x </m> by <m> a ^ { - 1 } c </m> -LRB- if it exists -RRB- , it also follows that <m> f = q _ { 2 3 } \circ q _ { 1 3 } ^ { - 1 } \colon X \times _ S X \ -- > X \times _ S X , \quad ( a , c ) \mapsto ( a ^ { - 1 } c , c ) </m> is an <m> S </m> - birational map whose domain of definition and image are <m> X </m> - dense with respect to both projections . my question is : is <m> f </m> an open immersion on its domain of definition , as is claimed on p. 121 ? the apparent difficulty that is causing my trouble in seeing this is that even though i understand <m> f </m> on <m> q _ { 1 3 } ( \Gamma ) </m> , it could conceivably happen that the domain of definition of <m> f </m> is larger , to the effect that <m> f </m> looses direct touch with <m> m </m> . to get the conclusion from zariski 's main theorem , it would suffice to argue that <m> f </m> is injective -LRB- on <m> T </m> - points for every <m> T </m> -RRB- , but the injectivity is not clear to me either -LRB- same difficulty -RRB- . what i am asking about is used in the proof of lemma 6 on p. 126 although the full strength of the claim is seemingly not needed there . in particular , the said proof -LRB- which seems absolutely crucial for the overall goal of the book -RRB- may be salvaged even if my question turns out to have a negative answer .
let <m> G </m> be a finite group with a subgroup <m> K </m> . given <m> [ \beta ] \in H ^ 2 ( K , \mathbb { C } ^ * ) </m> is the an obstruction which checks whether or not <m> [ \beta ] </m> is the restriction of some <m> [ \alpha ] \in H ^ 2 ( G , \mathbb { C } ^ * ) </m> -LRB- all with trivial action -RRB- ? or more generally if it is a restriction of a 2-cocycle from some subgroup in <m> G </m> which contains <m> K </m> ? when <m> G </m> is abelian , this question can be reduced to the case where <m> G </m> is a <m> p </m> - group because if <m> G = G _ 1 \times G _ 2 </m> is a product of groups of coprime orders , then <m> H ^ 2 ( G , \mathbb { C } ^ * ) = H ^ 2 ( G _ 1 , \mathbb { C } ^ * ) \times H ^ 2 ( G _ 2 , \mathbb { C } ^ * ) </m> and <m> K </m> must be of the form <m> K _ 1 \times K _ 2 </m> with <m> K _ i \leq G _ i </m> . given <m> G </m> , a subgroup <m> K </m> and a 2-cocycle on <m> K </m> , i can check if it can be extended to some sub group of <m> G </m> using some long algorithm which plays around with the generators of <m> G </m> and <m> K </m> and the values of the cocycle . it mainly asks what roots of unity appear in the cocycle in relation to the order of the elements in the group . my question is if there is a more direct way of checking that -LRB- for an arbitrary group , or at least for a large family of groups -RRB- . in case such an obstruction is n't known -LRB- or it is too complicated on its own -RRB- , i would be happy if someone can point me to a database of 2-cocycles on small groups -LRB- if there is one -RRB- .
there are several scattered statements about fixed points and obstructions which i 'd very much like to see unified in some framework . to state them let <m> G </m> be a group acting on a connected -LRB- 1-truncated -RRB- groupoid <m> X </m> . firstly let 's choose a point in <m> X </m> and take <m> X = B A u t ( \pi _ 1 ( X ) ) = : B A </m> . for the purpose of this question i 'd like to find a unified homotopy theoretic approach for the following statements :
let <m> p \in [ 1 , \infty ) \setminus \{ 2 \} </m> . suppose <m> ( e _ n ) </m> is a basic sequence in <m> \ell _ p </m> -LRB- or <m> L _ p </m> -RRB- equivalent to the basis of <m> \ell _ p </m> -LRB- <m> L _ p </m> -RRB- . is there a subsequence <m> ( e _ { n _ k } ) </m> such that <m> [ e _ { n _ k } ] </m> is complemented ?
is there any integer <m> n \ge 2 </m> such that <m> 2 ^ n \equiv 3 \bmod n </m> ? i understand that <m> n </m> must be an odd non-prime . i checked up to a million with no success -LRB- but <m> 2 ^ n \equiv 5 \bmod n </m> and <m> 2 ^ n \equiv 7 \bmod n </m> have solutions -RRB- .
the following paradox has got me stumped . i 'm hoping someone can point out the error . take a locally compact metric space <m> X </m> and define the <m> C _ b ( X ) </m> and <m> C _ 0 ( X ) </m> as the spaces of continuous real-valued functions on <m> X </m> , bounded for <m> C _ b </m> and converging to zero at infinity for <m> C _ 0 </m> , and equip the spaces with the supremum norm . by dunford & schwartz th . iv .6.2 , the topological dual <m> C _ b ' </m> is isometrically isomorphic to the space <m> r b a ( X ) </m> of regular bounded finitely additive borel measures on <m> X </m> ; by rudin -LRB- real and complex analysis , th . 6.19 -RRB- <m> C _ 0 ' </m> is isometrically isomorphic to the space <m> r c a ( X ) </m> of regular countably additive borel measures . in both cases the identification has the form <m> \langle \xi , f \rangle = \int _ X f \, d \mu _ \xi </m> . since <m> C _ 0 \subset C _ b </m> , and since <m> C _ 0 </m> and <m> C _ b </m> share the same norm , a simple calculation gives that <m> C _ b ' \subset C _ 0 ' </m> ; since the two identification structures above are the same , this implies that <m> r b a \subset r c a </m> . however , the definitions of <m> r b a </m> and <m> r c a </m> immediately imply that <m> r c a \subset r b a </m> . what is going wrong here ?
here is a slightly anecdotical notational question . let <m> S </m> be a scheme and let <m> X </m> be a scheme over <m> S </m> , with structural morphism <m> s \colon X \to S </m> . is there a good suggestive notation for the group <m> \lbrace ( f , g ) \in \mathrm { A u t } ( X ) \times \mathrm { A u t } ( S ) ~ \vert ~ s f = g s \rbrace </m> ? after chatting with a categorical friend , this can be described succinctly as the automorphism group of <m> X \to S </m> -LRB- considered as an object in the arrow category of schemes -RRB- . in fact , i 'm interested in finding a good notation when <m> S </m> is -LRB- the spectrum of -RRB- a field <m> k </m> and <m> X </m> is an affine algebraic group <m> G </m> over <m> k </m> . i thought about using <m> \mathrm { A u t } ( G \to k ) </m> or <m> \mathrm { A u t } ( G \to \mathrm { S p e c } ( k ) ) </m> , but there might be something more adapted or already existing in the literature .
we fix <m> G = \mathrm { S L } _ 3 ( \mathbf { R } ) </m> .
is still relevant or interesting be capable to bring a criteria in order to classifly quadratic extensions of <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> based on the existence or not existence of non-trivial solutions of fermat 's cubic equation in the ring of integers belonging to those extensions ? considering d as the only number necessary to determine if <m> \mathbb { Q } [ \sqrt { d } ] </m> has or not non-trivial solutions .
let <m> \mathcal { A } </m> and <m> \mathcal { B } </m> be two <m> 2 </m> - categories and <m> F : \mathcal { A } \to \mathcal { B } </m> be a lax <m> 2 </m> - functor . given <m> 1 </m> - cells <m> ( f _ { i } ) _ { 0 \leq i \leq n } </m> of <m> \mathcal { A } </m> such that the composition <m> f _ { n } \circ f _ { n - 1 } \circ \cdots \circ f _ { 0 } </m> makes sense , this data together with the structural <m> 2 </m> - cells of <m> F </m> give many paths of <m> 2 </m> - cells going from <m> F ( f _ { n } ) \circ F ( f _ { n - 1 } ) \circ \cdots \circ F ( f _ { 0 } ) </m> to <m> F ( f _ { n } \circ f _ { n - 1 } \circ \cdots \circ f _ { 0 } ) </m> , for instance <m> F ( f _ { n } ) \circ F ( f _ { n - 1 } ) \circ \cdots \circ F ( f _ { 0 } ) \Rightarrow F ( f _ { n } \circ f _ { n - 1 } ) \circ F ( f _ { n - 2 } ) \circ \cdots \circ F ( f _ { 0 } ) \Rightarrow \cdots </m> <m> \Rightarrow F ( f _ { n } \circ f _ { n - 1 } \circ \cdots \circ f _ { 0 } ) </m> and <m> F ( f _ { n } ) \circ F ( f _ { n - 1 } ) \circ \cdots \circ F ( f _ { 0 } ) \Rightarrow F ( f _ { n } ) \circ F ( f _ { n - 1 } ) \circ \cdots \circ F ( f _ { 1 } \circ f _ { 0 } ) \Rightarrow \cdots </m> <m> \Rightarrow F ( f _ { n } \circ f _ { n - 1 } \circ \cdots \circ f _ { 0 } ) </m> which correspond to what one gets by `` parenthesizing on the left '' and `` parenthesizing on the right '' respectively . it seems to seem obvious that it follows from the definition of lax functor that the <m> C _ { n } </m> ways to parenthesize the left hand side all give the same <m> 2 </m> - cell <m> F ( f _ { n } ) \circ F ( f _ { n - 1 } ) \circ \cdots \circ F ( f _ { 0 } ) \Rightarrow F ( f _ { n } \circ f _ { n - 1 } \circ \cdots \circ f _ { 0 } ) </m> since i need this property for a text i am writing , i would like to provide a reference . my question is the following :
let <m> G Q ( 2 , 4 ) </m> denote the abstract configuration -LRB- = incidence structure -RRB- consisting of <m> 2 7 </m> points and <m> 4 5 </m> lines , with <m> 3 </m> points on leach line and <m> 5 </m> lines through each point , which can be described in any one of the following ways :
let 's start with a definition : definition : a scalar k-th order differential equation on a smooth manifold <m> M </m> , is <m> F ( x , v , \frac { \partial { ^ \left | \sigma \right | } v } { \partial x ^ \sigma } ) = 0 </m> for <m> \left | \sigma \right | \leqslant k </m> . this equation can be viewed as hypersurface <m> E = F ( x , u , p _ \sigma ) = 0 \subset J ^ k M </m> in the space of k-jets . an n-dimensional integral manifold <m> L </m> of the cartan distribution is called a multivalued solution of equation e , if <m> L \subset E </m> . -LRB- see a.g. kushner 's paper about the classification of monge-ampère equations -RRB-
let <m> N </m> be a nonzero rational number . for every prime number <m> p </m> with <m> v _ p ( N ) = 0 </m> , let <m> a _ p </m> denote the index in <m> \mathbb Z / p \mathbb Z </m> of the subgroup generated by <m> N </m> modulo <m> p </m> . so we have <m> a _ p = 1 </m> if and only if <m> N </m> is a primitive root mod <m> p </m> .
let <m> p </m> be a prime . let <m> f \in \mathbb { F } _ p [ x _ 1 , \ldots , x _ n ] </m> be a homogenous polynomial of degree <m> p </m> . can <m> f </m> have more than <m> ( 1 - p ^ { - 1 } + p ^ { - 2 } ) p ^ n </m> zeroes in <m> \mathbb { F } _ p ^ n </m> ? basic observations : the lower bound -LRB- for <m> n \geq 2 </m> -RRB- is achieved by <m> \prod _ { c \in \mathbb { F } _ p } ( x _ 1 - c x _ 2 ) </m> . if nonhomogenous polynomials are allowed , we can get all <m> p ^ n </m> points to be zeroes , using <m> \prod ( x _ 1 - c ) </m> . it 's easy to show a product of hyperplanes ca n't beat <m> ( 1 - p ^ { - 1 } + p ^ { - 2 } ) p ^ n </m> .
given a discrete group <m> \Gamma </m> generated by <m> S </m> let <m> K [ S ] </m> denote the subring of the group-ring <m> K [ \Gamma ] </m> generated by <m> S </m> -LRB- over a commutative ring <m> K </m> -RRB- . the ring <m> K [ S ] </m> is thus a quotient of the free algebra generated by non-commutative variables indexed by <m> S </m> . are there examples where the free monoid <m> S ^ * </m> injects into <m> \Gamma </m> but <m> K [ S ] </m> is not free ? -LRB- i guess the answer should be yes -RRB- . on the other hand , there should also be examples where <m> K [ S ] </m> is the free algebra of non-commutative polynomials over <m> S </m> , although <m> \Gamma </m> is not free -LRB- this implies of course that <m> S ^ * </m> injects into <m> \Gamma </m> -RRB- . remark : the subring <m> K [ S ] </m> is of course isomorphic to <m> K [ \Gamma ] </m> if <m> \Gamma </m> is a torsion-group -LRB- or more generally , if all elements of <m> S </m> represent torsion elements of <m> \Gamma </m> -RRB- .
let <m> \alpha > 0 </m> and <m> X </m> be an <m> \alpha </m> - normal -LRB- meaning , for <m> x , y \in X </m> , <m> 0 \leq x \leq y </m> implies <m> \| x \| \leq \alpha \| y \| </m> -RRB- ordered banach space with closed generating cone <m> X _ { + } </m> . if <m> X </m> is reflexive , then every pair of elements from <m> X </m> has a minimal upper bound , i.e. , for <m> x , y \in X </m> , there exists some <m> z \in X </m> with <m> \{ x , y \} \leq z </m> , such that <m> \{ x , y \} \leq w \leq z </m> implies <m> w = z </m> . one can show this using zorn 's lemma and the fact that order intervals are weakly compact -LRB- since they are convex , closed and norm bounded , and the space is reflexive -RRB- .
let <m> E _ 1 </m> and <m> E _ 2 </m> be objects in an abelian category <m> \mathcal { C } </m> . how can i see the natural action of <m> \mathrm { H o m } ( E _ 2 , E _ 1 ) </m> on <m> \mathrm { E x t } ^ 1 ( E _ 2 , E _ 1 ) </m> ?
recently , prompted by considerations in conformal field theory , i was lead to guess that for every compact connected lie group <m> G </m> , the fourth cohomology group of it classifying space is torsion free . by using the structure theory of connected lie groups and a couple of serre spectral sequences , i was quickly able to prove that result . however , this feels unsatisfactory : as i hinted on the first paragraph , the fact that <m> H ^ 4 ( B G , \mathbb Z ) </m> is torsion free seems to have a meaning . but what that meaning exactly is is not quite clear to me ... in order to get a better feeling of what that meaning might be , i therefore ask the following :
we know well this short exact sequence <m> 1 \to \mathbb { Z } _ 2 \to S p i n ( N ) \to S O ( N ) \to 1 . </m> the <m> j </m> - th stiefel-whitney class of the associated vector bundle of <m> S O ( N ) </m> , as <m> w _ j ( V _ { S O ( N ) } ) </m> , can be nontrivial in general , <m> w _ j ( V _ { S O ( N ) } ) \in H ^ j ( B G , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) \overset { ? } { = } H ^ j ( B S O ( N ) , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) . </m> here i suppose the <m> G = S O ( N ) </m> . we can either use the topological cohomology <m> H ^ j ( B G , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) </m> of classifying space <m> B G </m> , or consider the group cohomology h <m> ^ j ( G , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) </m> of the group <m> G </m> . if the corresponding vector bundle of is the tangent bundle of the base manifold <m> M </m> , we have <m> w _ j ( M ) \in H ^ j ( M , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) . </m>
an integral representation for the bessel function <m> K _ \alpha </m> for real <m> x > 0 </m> is given by <m> K _ \alpha ( x ) = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \int _ { - \infty } ^ { \infty } e ^ { \alpha h ( t ) } d t </m> where <m> h ( \alpha ) = t - ( \frac { x } { \alpha } ) \cosh t </m>
while the poincaré-birkhoff-witt theorem is usually proven -LRB- and sometimes even formulated -RRB- for free modules only , it is known -LRB- see also here -RRB- that it holds for arbitrary modules if the ground ring is a <m> \mathbb Q </m> - algebra . i am wondering if a similar generalization holds for the following fact , which i learnt today from pavel etingof : let <m> \mathfrak c </m> be a lie algebra . let <m> \mathfrak a </m> and <m> \mathfrak b </m> be two lie subalgebras of <m> \mathfrak c </m> such that <m> \mathfrak a + \mathfrak b = \mathfrak c </m> . clearly , <m> \mathfrak a \cap \mathfrak b </m> is also a lie subalgebra of <m> \mathfrak c </m> . now , the map <m> U \left ( \mathfrak a \right ) \otimes _ { U \left ( \mathfrak a \cap \mathfrak b \right ) } U \left ( \mathfrak b \right ) \to U \left ( \mathfrak c \right ) , </m> <m> \alpha \otimes _ { U \left ( \mathfrak a \cap \mathfrak b \right ) } \beta \mapsto \alpha \beta </m> is an isomorphism -LRB- not of algebras , but of <m> \left ( U \left ( \mathfrak a \right ) , U \left ( \mathfrak b \right ) \right ) </m> - bimodules -RRB- . this is proven for free modules using pbw and appropriate bases . i had no time to do any research on this .
let <m> \pi </m> be a maass cusp form for sl -LRB- <m> 2 , \mathbb Z </m> -RRB- . let <m> \omega </m> be a primitive dirichlet character . let us consider the <m> L - </m> function <m> L ( s , S y m ^ 5 \pi \times \omega ) </m> or <m> L ( s , S y m ^ 6 \pi \times \omega ) </m> or <m> L ( s , S y m ^ 7 \pi \times \omega ) </m> or <m> L ( s , S y m ^ 8 \pi \times \omega ) </m> . are they known to be holomorphic on the whole complex plane ?
if you 're unfamiliar with the definition , for an oriented smooth manifold <m> M ^ n </m> we define the inertia group <m> I ( M ) </m> to be the set of -LRB- h-cobordism classes of -RRB- homotopy spheres <m> \Sigma ^ n </m> such that <m> M \# \Sigma </m> is orientation-preserving diffeomorphic to <m> M </m> . i 'm trying to compile results into an expository master 's thesis on the subject , and it seems silly to not know the origin . digging through old papers about the inertia group , i 'm having a hard time finding the start of the trail . many early papers refer to tamura 's `` sur les sommes connexes de certaines variétés différentiables '' so i expect it to be close to the beginning , but i have been unable to find a copy of this paper . i am aware of a few members here who are familiar with this theory , and maybe were even around when it started . does anyone happen to know in which paper/book the inertia group originated ?
is the following true/known ? let <m> E </m> be a -LRB- real -RRB- vector bundle over a compact cw-complex <m> X </m> . suppose that <m> w _ i ( E ) = 0 </m> for <m> 0 < i < 2 ^ r </m> . then there exist a space <m> Y </m> and a map <m> f \colon Y \to X </m> such that -LRB- 1 -RRB- <m> f ^ * \colon H ^ * ( X ; \mathbb F _ 2 ) \to H ^ * ( Y ; \mathbb F _ 2 ) </m> is injective ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- for some <m> k \geqslant 0 </m> , the vector bundle <m> f ^ * ( E ) \oplus ( k ) </m> over <m> Y </m> is isomorphic to a sum of vector bundles of the form <m> ( L _ 1 \oplus ( 1 ) ) \otimes \dots \otimes ( L _ { r + 1 } \oplus ( 1 ) ) , </m> where <m> L _ s </m> are line bundles -LRB- and <m> ( n ) </m> denotes the <m> n </m> - dimensional trivial bundle -RRB- .
what is <m> \mathrm { H o m } ( \mathbb { Q } , \mathbb { Z } ( p ^ { \infty } ) ) </m> ? i have a reference that says the group in question is <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p , </m> the additive group of the quotient field of the <m> p </m> - adic integers . can anyone provide a reasonable derivation of this result ?
i have a very naive question . recall that over the field of complex numbers , there exist non-algebraic k3 surfaces . namely , smooth non-projective simply connected compact complex surfaces with trivial canonical bundle . such surfaces often come in useful when studying the moduli and deformations of k3 surfaces over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> .
i 'm trying to learn more tools from microlocal analysis by reading grigis and sjostrand 's microlocal analysis for differential operators . in the first chapter , they define the standard <m> C ^ \infty </m> symbol class <m> S ^ m _ { \rho , \delta } ( X \times \mathbb { R } ^ N ) </m> for <m> X \subseteq \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> open , <m> m \in \mathbb { R } </m> , and <m> 0 \le \rho , \delta \le 1 </m> : <m>  </m> k \ subseteq x <m> , </m> \ alpha \ in \ mathbb -LCB- n -RCB- ^ n <m> , a n d </m> \ beta \ in \ mathbb -LCB- n -RCB- ^ n <m> , </m> \ exists c _ -LCB- k , \ alpha , \ beta -RCB- > 0 <m>  </m> the class <m> S ^ { - \infty } ( X \times \mathbb { R } ^ N ) </m> is defined by : <m>  </m> k \ subseteq x <m> , </m> \ alpha \ in \ mathbb -LCB- n -RCB- ^ n <m> , </m> \ beta \ in \ mathbb -LCB- n -RCB- ^ n <m> , a n d </m> m \ in \ mathbb -LCB- r -RCB- <m> , </m> \ exists c _ -LCB- k , \ alpha , \ beta , m -RCB- > 0 <m>  </m> after these definitions they make the following comment -LRB- what follows is a direct quote from the text -RRB- .
consider the graph <m> G _ n </m> , with <m> V ( G _ n ) = S _ n </m> -LRB- the set of permutations of a set of size <m> n </m> -RRB- and having an edge <m> \sigma \sigma ' </m> iif <m> \sigma ' </m> can be obtained from <m> \sigma </m> by applying a transposition . this <m> G _ n </m> , defined that way , has a `` name '' ? it seems pretty easy , -LRB- and this is the main question -RRB- but i 'm not sure how <m> G _ n </m> `` looks like '' . for instante :
i 've been prodded to ask a question expanding this one on ramanujan 's constant <m> R = \exp ( \pi \sqrt { 1 6 3 } ) </m> . recall that <m> R </m> is very close to an integer ; specifically <m> R = 2 6 2 5 3 7 4 1 2 6 4 0 7 6 8 7 4 4 - \epsilon </m> where <m> \epsilon </m> is about <m> 0 . 7 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 2 } </m> . call the integer here <m> N </m> , so <m> R = N - \epsilon </m> . so <m> R ^ 2 = N ^ 2 - 2 N \epsilon + \epsilon ^ 2 </m> . it turns out that <m> N \epsilon </m> is itself nearly an integer , namely <m> 1 9 6 8 8 4 </m> , and so <m> R ^ 2 </m> is again an almost-integer . more precisely , <m> j ( \tau ) = 1 / q + 7 4 4 + 1 9 6 8 8 4 q + 2 1 4 9 3 7 6 0 q ^ 2 + O ( q ^ 3 ) </m> where <m> q = \exp ( 2 \pi i \tau ) </m> . for <m> \tau = ( 1 + \sqrt { - 1 6 3 } ) / 2 </m> , and hence <m> q = \exp ( - \pi \sqrt { 1 6 3 } ) </m> , it 's known that the left-hand side is an integer . squaring both sides , <m> j ( \tau ) ^ 2 = 1 / q ^ 2 + 1 4 8 8 / q + 9 7 4 3 0 4 + 3 3 5 9 5 0 9 1 2 q + O ( q ^ 2 ) . </m> to show that <m> 1 / q ^ 2 </m> is nearly an integer , we can rearrange a bit to get <m> j ( \tau ) ^ 2 - 1 / q ^ 2 - 9 7 4 3 0 4 = 1 4 8 8 / q + 3 3 5 9 5 0 9 1 2 q + O ( q ^ 2 ) </m> and we want the left-hand side to be nearly zero . <m> 1 4 8 8 / q </m> is nearly an integer since <m> 1 / q </m> is nearly an integer ; since q is small the higher-order terms on the right-hand side are small . as noted by mark thomas in this question , <m> R ^ 5 </m> is also very close to an integer -- but as i pointed out , that integer is not <m> N ^ 5 </m> . this is n't special to fifth powers . <m> R </m> , <m> R ^ 2 </m> , <m> R ^ 3 </m> , <m> R ^ 4 </m> , <m> R ^ 5 </m> , <m> R ^ 6 </m> , respectively differ from the nearest integer by less than <m> 1 0 ^ { - 1 2 } </m> , <m> 1 0 ^ { - 9 } </m> , <m> 1 0 ^ { - 8 } </m> , <m> 1 0 ^ { - 6 } </m> , <m> 1 0 ^ { - 5 } </m> , <m> 1 0 ^ { - 4 } </m> , and <m> 1 0 ^ { - 2 } </m> . but the method of proof outlined above does n't work for higher powers , since the coefficients of the <m> q </m> - expansion of <m> j ( \tau ) ^ 5 </m> -LRB- for example -RRB- grow too quickly . is there some explanation for the fact that these higher powers are almost integers ?
recall that a graph is called <m> k </m> - chordal if any cycle <m> C </m> of length <m> > k </m> contains a chord , i.e. an edge joining to non-consecutive vertices in <m> C </m> . let <m> f ( n , k ) </m> be the minimal number of edges s.t. any graph on <m> n </m> vertices can be made <m> k </m> - chordal by deleting at most <m> f ( n , k ) </m> edges . there is a paper of erd \ h -LCB- o -RCB- s and laskar `` on maxinal chordal subgraph '' where they show that <m> f ( n , 3 ) = \frac { n ^ 2 } { 2 } - ( 1 + o ( 1 ) ) \sqrt { 2 } n ^ { 3 / 2 } . </m> i am wondering if other bounds for <m> f ( n , k ) </m> are known for bigger <m> k </m> . a bound in terms of the number of edges is also of interest . in particular , is is true that there is some bounded <m> k </m> s.t. <m> f ( n , k ) = o ( | E | ) , </m> where <m> E </m> is the number of edges ? upd the answer for the last question is no , as seen from the following example . take <m> k + 1 </m> copies of <m> K _ { n / ( k + 1 ) } </m> , call it <m> G _ 0 , . . . , G _ k </m> . join all vertices in <m> G _ i </m> and <m> G _ { i + 1 } </m> -LRB- addition mod <m> ( k + 1 ) </m> -RRB- . one can show that for this graph <m> f ( n , k ) \geq n ^ 2 / 4 ( k + 1 ) ^ 2 </m> . it is interesting to see what is the right constant , though .
a curious puzzle for which i would appreciate an explanation . for <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> both uniformly and independently distributed in <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> , the value of <m> \lfloor 1 / ( x y ) \rfloor </m> has a bias toward odd numbers . here are <m> 1 0 </m> random trials : <m> 5 1 , 3 4 , 1 , 2 3 9 , 9 , 4 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 1 </m> with <m> 7 </m> odd numbers . here are <m> 1 0 ^ 6 </m> trials , placed into even and odd bins :
let <m> E _ 4 ( z ) = - \frac { B _ 4 } { 8 } + \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \sigma _ 3 ( n ) q ^ n </m> and <m> E _ 6 ( z ) = - \frac { B _ 6 } { 1 2 } + \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty \sigma _ 5 ( n ) q ^ n </m> how does one show they are algebraically independant over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> ?
if i understand correctly , the standard <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 4 </m> is diffeomorphic to <m> \mathbb { R } \times W </m> where <m> W </m> is the whitehead manifold -LRB- i.e. , is an open three-manifold that is contractible and not diffeomorphic to <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 3 </m> -RRB- . if we consider the standard euclidean metric on <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 4 </m> what , if anything , can be said about the -LRB- submanifold -RRB- geometry of the image of <m> \lbrace 0 \rbrace \times W </m> under this identification ? for instance , this hypersurface ca n't be totally geodesic -LRB- otherwise it would be diffeomorphic to <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 3 </m> -RRB- , but can it be asymptotically flat ? asymptotically conical ? is the -LRB- asymptotic -RRB- geometry always more complicated ? are there any natural geometric restrictions ?
micha perles used gale diagrams to compute the number of simplicial <m> d </m> - polytopes with <m> d + 3 </m> vertices and of general <m> d </m> - polytopes with <m> d + 3 </m> vertices . the computation can be found in chapter 6.3 of grunbaum 's book , `` convex polytopes '' . my question is for formulas for the number of simplicial <m> d </m> - polytopes with <m> d + 3 </m> labelled vertices and general <m> d </m> - polytopes with <m> d + 3 </m> labelled vertices . the gale-diagram technique should apply -LRB- and probably be easier -RRB- but i am not aware of this being done . one motivation would be in trying to compute the number of simplicial d-polytopes , triangulations of <m> ( d - 1 ) </m> - spheres -LRB- and related non simplicial objects -RRB- with <m> d + 4 </m> labelled vertices .
let <m> k </m> be a number field , and let <m> G </m> be a split simply connected algebraic group over <m> k </m> . let <m> \Omega _ k </m> denote the set of places of <m> k </m> . let <m> T </m> be a maximal torus of <m> G </m> -LRB- defined over <m> k </m> -RRB- . consider the second tate-shafarevich group <m> ^ 2 ( k , T ) = \ker \left [ H ^ 2 ( k , T ) \to \prod _ { v \in \Omega _ k } H ^ 2 ( k _ v , T ) \right ] . </m>
i have a random variable <m> x \in ( 0 , \infty ) </m> with distribution <m> P ( x ) </m> falling off slowly <m> P ( x ) \sim 1 / x ^ 3 </m> for large <m> x </m> . so the expectation value <m> \bar { x } </m> is finite but the second moment <m> \bar { x ^ 2 } </m> is divergent . if i remember correctly this class of distributions also falls into the gaussian universality class , i.e. the distribution of the mean <m> \bar { x } = \frac { 1 } { N } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } x _ i </m> will be gaussian for large <m> N </m> where of course all <m> x _ i </m> are distributed according to <m> P ( x ) </m> . if the tail of <m> P ( x ) </m> is <m> 1 / x ^ { \alpha + 1 } </m> then -LRB- again if i remember correctly -RRB- for <m> 1 < \alpha < 2 </m> we have the <m> \alpha </m> - stable levy distributions for the central limit distribution , but for <m> \alpha = 2 </m> it is already gaussian . obviously for <m> \alpha > 2 </m> it will definitely be gaussian since both first and second moments exist in this case . now what i 'm not sure about is whether if i have the <m> x _ i </m> `` measurements '' and estimate <m> \bar { x } </m> by <m> \bar { x } = \frac { 1 } { N } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ N x _ i </m> then can i use the usual <m> \sigma _ N / \sqrt { N } </m> formula for the `` error '' where <m> \sigma _ N ^ 2 = \frac { 1 } { N - 1 } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ N \left ( x _ i - \bar { x } \right ) ^ 2 </m> i.e. will it be true that if <m> N </m> is large enough then the estimated <m> \bar { x } </m> will be within <m> \sigma _ N / \sqrt { N } </m> of the true mean with probability 68 % ? on the one hand since for large <m> N </m> the central limit theorem will give me a gaussian where <m> 1 - \sigma </m> deviation is certainly 68 % so i 'd think the above is correct but on the other hand <m> \sigma _ N </m> is divergent for all finite <m> N </m> . but i guess <m> \sigma _ N </m> is only divergent as <m> \sim \log ( N ) </m> so <m> \sigma _ N / \sqrt { N } </m> still goes to zero as it should . but i 'm still kinda confused . if the above does n't make any sense , how would you determine the interval around the estimated mean <m> \bar { x } </m> such that the true mean is within that with probability 68 % ? update : is it known what the first correction is to the <m> \sigma _ N / \sqrt { N } \sim \sqrt { \log ( N ) / N } </m> form ? is it only logarithmically small like <m> \sqrt { \log ( N ) / N } \left ( 1 + c o n s t / \log ( N ) + \ldots \right ) </m> or faster ?
i apologize in advance if this is too amateur , this is not really my area , but i 'm very curious . we have a permutation <m> \pi \in S _ n </m> and we want to represent it as a product of <m> \sigma = ( 1 \; 2 ) </m> and <m> \rho = ( 1 \; 2 \; \ldots \; n ) </m> . what is the minimum number of transpositions needed to do it ? for example the cost of representation of <m> ( 2 \; 3 ) \in S _ 3 </m> as <m> ( 1 \; 2 \; 3 ) ^ { - 1 } ( 1 \; 2 ) ( 1 \; 2 \; 3 ) </m> is <m> 1 </m> . is this problem well-known ? i 've experimented with it and i have the following algorithm that works correctly for all permutations with <m> n \le 1 0 </m> and for a decent amount of random bigger permutations -LRB- with <m> n \le 3 0 </m> -RRB- but i have no clue why it does . this problem could be reduced to the following : represent <m> \pi </m> as the product of the least amount of transpositions <m> ( 1 \; 2 ) , ( 2 \; 3 ) , \ldots , ( n - 1 \; n ) , ( n \; 1 ) </m> as possible . the answer to the initial problem is minimum of the lengths of shortest representations of <m> \langle \rho \rangle \pi \cup \pi \langle \rho \rangle </m> . without the transposition <m> ( n \; 1 ) </m> , it 'd be trivial bubble sort problem . each element of the set <m> \{ 1 , \ldots , n \} </m> has a trajectory with respect to a representation as a product of these transpositions i.e. if <m> \pi = \alpha _ 1 \cdot \ldots \cdot \alpha _ k </m> then the trajectory of <m> i </m> is <m> \alpha _ k ( i ) , \alpha _ { k - 1 } \alpha _ k ( i ) , \ldots , \pi ( i ) </m> for the bubble sort , the trajectory in the optimal representation is unique up to the repetitions , if <m> \pi ( i ) < i </m> then it looks like <m> i , \ldots , i , i - 1 , \ldots , i - 1 , i - 2 , \ldots , i - 2 , \ldots , \pi ( i ) \ldots , \pi ( i ) </m> . with the transposition <m> ( n \; 1 ) </m> the situation changes and there are two possibilities for the trajectory of each element : for <m> i > \pi ( i ) </m> the new option for trajectory is <m> i , i + 1 , \ldots , n , 1 , \ldots , \pi ( i ) </m> -LRB- repetitions omitted -RRB- . we say that <m> i _ 0 </m> and <m> j _ 0 </m> form an inversion with respect to the trajectories <m> a _ 1 , \ldots , a _ k </m> -LRB- the trajectory of <m> i _ 0 </m> -RRB- and <m> b _ 1 , \ldots , b _ m </m> -LRB- the trajectory of <m> j _ 0 </m> -RRB- iff for every sequence <m> ( x _ 1 , y _ 1 ) , \ldots , ( x _ { m + k - 2 } , y _ { m + k - 2 } ) \in [ k ] \times [ m ] </m> such that <m> ( x _ { i + 1 } , y _ { i + 1 } ) \in \{ ( x _ i + 1 , y _ i ) , ( x _ i , y _ i + 1 ) \} </m> for each <m> i \in \{ 1 , \ldots , m + k - 3 \} </m> , <m> x _ 1 = y _ 1 = 1 </m> , <m> x _ { m + k - 2 } = k ; \; y _ { m + k - 2 } = m </m> there exists <m> i \in [ m + k - 3 ] </m> such that <m> a _ { x _ i } = b _ { y _ i } </m> or <m> a _ { x _ { i + 1 } } = b _ { y _ { i + 1 } } </m> or <m> a _ { x _ i } = b _ { y _ { i + 1 } } \land a _ { x _ { i + 1 } } = b _ { y _ i } </m> i.e. it 's not possible to move <m> i _ 0 </m> and <m> j _ 0 </m> along their trajectories such that they never swap . therefore if we fix one of the options for each element in <m> \{ 1 , \ldots , n \} </m> then the number of transpositions needed to represent <m> \pi </m> with fixed trajectories equals to the number of inversions with respect to the trajectories . the algorithm . fix <m> s \in \{ 0 , \ldots , n - 1 \} </m> and consider a permutation <m> \sigma = ( 1 \; 2 \; \ldots \; n ) ^ s \pi </m> . for each <m> i \in [ n ] </m> select the trajectory involving <m> ( 1 \; n ) </m> if <m> | i - \sigma ( i ) | > { n \over 2 } </m> and select the standard trajectory otherwise . for each <m> s </m> calculate the number of inversions with respect to selected trajectories and print the minimum of these values .
hello ! i am interested in the asymptotic behavior of the function <m> p _ o ( n ) </m> defined as the number of partitions of <m> n </m> into odd prime parts a099773 - http://oeis.org/a099773 . i could n't find any paper or book studying the mentioned quantity but the amount of literature available to me is quite limited and i am wondering if someone could tell me what the asymptotic behavior of <m> p _ o ( n ) </m> is and perhaps point out a relevant reference for me to read . thanks !
i am looking for a reference for a complete list of 3-cocycle representatives for <m> H ^ 3 ( D _ { 2 n } , \mathbb { C } ^ \times ) </m> , where <m> D _ { 2 n } = \langle a , b \mid a ^ 2 = b ^ 2 = ( a b ) ^ n = e \rangle </m> is the dihedral group of order <m> 2 n </m> . here 's what i believe so far , but i do not know much group cohomology . first , i believe there are isomorphisms <m> H ^ 3 ( D _ { 2 n } , \mathbb { C } ^ \times ) \cong H ^ 4 ( D _ { 2 n } , \mathbb { Z } ) \cong H _ 3 ( D _ { 2 n } , \mathbb { Z } ) . </m> i calculated these groups in gap for <m> 2 \leq n \leq 1 0 </m> , and i got the following formula : <m>  </m> n <m>  </m> n <m>  </m> are these formulas correct ? is there a reference for this , or does it follow by some spectral sequence calculation ? why is there an extra factor of <m> \mathbb { Z } / 2 </m> when <m> n </m> is even ? second , i believe i have a formula for 3-cocycles representing the <m> \mathbb { Z } / n </m> factor , which is the factor i most care about . to give this formula , i use the following notation . first , represent the elements of <m> D _ { 2 n } </m> by the alternating words in <m> a , b </m> with length at most <m> 2 n - 1 </m> which always start with <m> a </m> . for such a word <m> w </m> , let <m> | w | </m> be its length . if <m> \zeta _ n = \exp ( 2 \pi i / n ) </m> , then for <m> k = 0 , \dots , n - 1 </m> , i believe the maps <m>  </m> | y | <m> i s e v e n a n d </m> | y | + | z | \ geq 2n <m>  </m> | y | <m> i s o d d a n d </m> | z | > | y | <m>  </m> give a complete list of normalized 3-cocycle representatives for the <m> \mathbb { Z } / n </m> factor of <m> H ^ 3 ( D _ { 2 n } , \mathbb { C } ^ \times ) </m> . certainly the <m> \lambda _ k </m> act like <m> \mathbb { Z } / n </m> under multiplication , but is there an easy way to see they are not cohomologous ? is there an easier way to express these formulas , perhaps by choosing a different presentation of <m> D _ { 2 n } </m> ? finally , the formulas above yield the trivial 3-cocycle when restricted to the two copies of <m> \mathbb { Z } / 2 </m> generated by <m> a </m> and <m> b </m> . to see this , just note <m> \lambda _ k </m> is normalized , <m> \lambda _ k ( a , a , a ) = 1 </m> , and if <m> w = ( a b ) ^ { n - 1 } a </m> , which is equal to <m> b </m> , then <m> \lambda _ k ( w , w , w ) = 1 </m> . -LRB- in both cases , <m> | y | </m> is odd and <m> | y | = | z | </m> . -RRB- i believe any 3-cocycle representatives for the other cohomology classes should not restrict trivially to at least one of these copies of <m> \mathbb { Z } / 2 </m> . partial answers would be greatly appreciated as well !
the existence of a countable approximate unit in a <m> C ^ { * } </m> - algebra <m> B </m> is equivalent to the existence of a strictly positive element <m> h \in B </m> . there are several ways to construct an approximate unit from <m> h </m> . my question is , does <m> h ( h + \frac { 1 } { n } ) ^ { - 1 } </m> constitute an approximate unit for <m> B </m> ?
this question has been bogging me down lately . i 'm not sure how to come up with an approach to tackle the proof exactly . i 'm without a proof , buti think the result i 'm searching for is true . similarly , i do believe i 'm not the only person to consider this question and i expect it is already answered somewhere in the vestibule of the internet . the <m> n </m> ` th super root is defined as the inverse to the function <m> ^ n x = F _ n ( x ) = x ^ { x ^ { . . . n \, t i m e s . . . ^ x } } </m> so that if <m> \Psi _ n ( x ) </m> is the function in question then <m> ^ n \Psi _ n ( x ) = F _ n ( \Psi _ n ( x ) ) = x </m> now <m> F _ n ( x ) </m> depends on the branch of the logarithm chosen to define it , and therefore it is multivalued . we will stick to the principal branch of the logarithm as it simplifies the question -LRB- and i assume solving for other branches only requires a modification of the proof -RRB- . it is obvious <m> F _ n ( x ) : \mathbb { C } / ( 0 , - \infty ) \to \mathbb { C } ^ { \times } </m> . it also follows that for <m> \Re ( y ) > 1 </m> there exists <m> x \in \mathbb { C } </m> such that <m> y = F _ n ( x ) </m> . now we can define an inverse through the analytic implicit function theorem granted that <m> \frac { d } { d x } F _ n ( x ) \neq 0 </m> when <m> \Re ( F _ n ( x ) ) > 1 </m> -- but showing this is rather daunting . it invovles showing when <m> \Re ( F _ n ( x ) ) > 1 </m> we have <m> \frac { F _ { n - 1 } ( x ) } { x } + \log ( x ) F ' _ { n - 1 } ( x ) \neq 0 </m> which is rather daunting to say the least . this brings me to my question which is more of a reference request than anything . unless i 'm completely missing something and the answer is right on my nose .
let <m> G </m> be a compact lie group and <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> be its lie algebra and <m> \mathfrak { g } ^ * </m> be its dual , then i am looking for explicit formula for hermitian form on coadjoint orbit of <m> G </m> on <m> \mathfrak { g } ^ * </m> . -LRB- note that <m> h = g - i \omega </m> and for <m> \omega </m> we have kirilov symplectic 2-form -RRB- -LRB- maybe it be possible by hodge star , but i could n't find -RRB-
suppose i have an expanding family of schreier graphs <m> Z _ n = \text { S c h } ( G _ n , S _ n , X _ n ) </m> of groups <m>  </m> n <m>  </m> acting on sets <m> S _ n = S ^ n </m> by generating sets <m> X _ n </m> , such that the generating sets are consistent , in the sense that the restriction of <m> X _ n </m> to <m> G _ m </m> for <m> m < n </m> is exactly <m> X _ m </m> . for a more concrete picture , think of the wreath product <m> G _ n </m> as acting on a <m> | S | </m> - regular tree by permuting the children of each vertex according to permutations in <m> G </m> . -LRB- if you 're familiar with this language , notice that this means that we have a covering map <m> Z _ n \to Z _ m </m> whenever <m> m < n </m> -RRB- . it seems that there should be some nice infinite object which is the limit of these graphs , and has some property related to the relative version of property <m> ( \tau ) </m> . more specifically , if we take <m> G _ \infty </m> to be the group of symmetries of the infinite <m> | S | </m> - regular tree where each automorphism is allowed to permute the children of a vertex using only permutations in <m> G </m> , if <m> \varphi _ n : G _ \infty \to G _ n </m> are the restriction maps to finite levels of the tree , and <m> X _ \infty </m> are the elements of <m> G _ \infty </m> that project to <m> X _ n </m> under <m> \varphi _ n </m> , the graphs <m> Z _ n </m> are precisely schreier graphs of <m> \left < X _ \infty \right > / \ker \varphi _ n </m> . if they were cayley graphs , this would mean that <m> \left < X _ \infty \right > </m> has property <m> ( \tau ) </m> with respect to the normal subgroups <m> \{ \ker \varphi _ n \} </m> . -LRB- also , see section 8 of this paper for context -RRB- . i would n't be surprised if someone has already worked out what this object should be - any ideas for references to look at ?
i have a circle of radius <m> r </m> , and i wish to place this circle of a <m> Z ^ 2 </m> integer lattice or an <m> A _ 2 </m> hexagonal lattice s.t. i maximize the number of lattice points within or along the contour of the circle . trivially , for <m> r < \frac { R } { 2 } </m> , where <m> R </m> is the smallest spacing between lattice points , it will be optimal to center the circle on a lattice point . however , is there an optimal position within the fundamental unit of either lattice if <m> r \geq T </m> , where <m> T </m> is some threshold value ? taking a guess for the <m> Z ^ 2 </m> integer lattice , i 'd say that centering the circle on a lattice point will be optimal for <m> r \geq \sqrt ( 2 ) </m> and <m> r < \frac { 1 } { 2 } </m> . for <m> \frac { \sqrt ( 2 ) } { 2 } \leq r < \sqrt ( 2 ) </m> , the optimal position for the circle will be in the center of the square unit cell of the lattice -LRB- allowing coverage of four lattice points -RRB- , and for <m> \frac { 1 } { 2 } \leq r < \frac { \sqrt ( 2 ) } { 2 } </m> , the optimal position will between two lattice points separated by the smallest possible inter-point distance -LRB- i.e. the unit distance -RRB- s.t. the circle covers these two points . however , i do n't know how to prove this . for an <m> A _ 2 </m> hexagonal lattice , we know for <m> r < \frac { 1 } { 2 } </m> that centering the circle on a lattice point will be optimal -LRB- allowing coverage of a single lattice point -RRB- , and can guess that the next optimal position will be between two lattice points separated by the smallest possible inter-point distance -LRB- i.e. the unit distance -RRB- for <m> \frac { 1 } { 2 } \leq r < \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 3 } } </m> -LRB- covering two lattice points -RRB- , then at the barycenter of an equilateral triangle cell in the lattice for <m> \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 3 } } \leq r < \frac { \sqrt { 3 } } { 2 } </m> -LRB- covering three lattice points -RRB- , then , it seems , back between two lattice points separated by the unit distance for <m> \frac { \sqrt { 3 } } { 2 } \leq r < 1 </m> -LRB- covering four lattice points -RRB- , then back to the center of the lattice for <m> r = 1 </m> -LRB- covering seven lattice points -RRB- ? is it optimal to remain centered on a lattice point for <m> r > 1 </m> ?
this problem was motivated by the mo problems : `` running most of the time in a connected set '' , `` is every metric continuum almost path connected ?

let <m> q = p ^ t </m> where <m> p </m> is prime . i am interested in estimating the complete exponential sum , which looks like <m> \sum _ { 0 \leq h < q } \chi ( ( h - a _ 1 ) ( h - a _ 2 ) ( h - a _ 3 ) ) \ \bar { \chi } ( ( h - b _ 1 ) ( h - b _ 2 ) ( h - b _ 3 ) ) \ e ^ { 2 \pi i C h / q } </m> in terms of integers <m> a _ i </m> 's and <m> b _ j </m> 's and <m> C </m> . here <m> \chi </m> is a dirichlet character modulo <m> q </m> . i was able to find a reference for something similar but i could n't quite deduce the bound for this sum . i would greatly appreciate if anyone knows bound for this . thank you very much .
for non-negative integer <m> d \le n </m> and <m> k \le 2 ^ n </m> , how many affine subspaces of co-dimension <m> d </m> are needed to cover all , but exactly <m> k </m> elements of the vector space <m> { \mathbb F } _ 2 ^ n </m> , and what are the possible values of <m> k </m> ? i know the answer in two particular cases . the case <m> d = 1 </m> is about hyperplane coverings . it is not difficult to see that in this case <m> k </m> must be a power of <m> 2 </m> , and for all but <m> k = 2 ^ s </m> elements to be covered , one needs at least <m> n - s </m> hyperplanes . another situation where the answer is known to me is <m> k = 1 </m> : by a year 1977 result of r. jamison , to cover all but exactly one element of <m> { \mathbb F } _ 2 ^ n </m> , one needs at least <m> n + 2 ^ d - d - 1 </m> affine co - <m> d </m> - subspaces . what is the answer in the general case ? has it ever been studied ?
pick a riemannian metric on <m> \mathbb { C } P ^ n </m> -LRB- say the one coming from kähler structure -RRB- . that gives us a riemannian metric on <m> T ^ * \mathbb { C } P ^ n , </m> so we define the co-sphere bundle <m> S ^ * \mathbb { C } P ^ n </m> as the sphere bundle of unit vectors in it . prove -LRB- or disprove -RRB- that <m> H ^ 1 ( S ^ * \mathbb { C } P ^ n , \mathbb { Z } ) = 0 . </m> this is true in dimension n = 1 where the co-sphere bundle is homeomorphic to <m> \mathbb { R } P ^ 3 . </m>
i hope this question is good to be here . let <m> J </m> be the jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve <m> H </m> of genus <m> 2 </m> given by <m> y ^ 2 = x ^ 5 + h </m> . i was calculating an explicit formula in mumford coordinates of <m> [ \sqrt { 5 } ] \in \text { E n d } ( J ) </m> . when i say mumford coordinates i mean divisors <m> D : = ( x _ 1 + x _ 2 , x _ 1 x _ 2 , \tfrac { y _ 1 - y _ 2 } { x _ 1 - x _ 2 } , \tfrac { x _ 2 y _ 1 - x _ 1 y _ 2 } { x _ 1 - x _ 2 } ) = : ( A , B , C , D ) \in J </m> where <m> \text { S u p p } ( D ) = \{ ( x _ 1 , y _ 1 ) , ( x _ 2 , y _ 2 ) \} </m> and <m> ( x _ i , y _ i ) \in H </m> . i used these coordinates in order to work with magma . the thing is , i got the formulae , the problem is that i do not know how to handle an special situation . what i did is to calculate <m> [ \zeta _ 5 + \zeta _ 5 ^ 4 ] \in \text { A u t } ( J ) </m> where the action of <m> \zeta _ 5 ^ i </m> on the curve <m> H </m> is given by <m> \zeta _ 5 ^ i ( x , y ) = ( \zeta _ 5 ^ i x , y ) </m> and then extend to the whole jacobian . after this , i calculated the formula for <m> 2 [ \zeta _ 5 + \zeta _ 5 ^ 4 ] + 1 = [ \sqrt { 5 } ] </m> using mumford coordinates and then if <m> D = ( A , B , C , D ) </m> then i got <m> \sigma _ i \in k ( J ) </m> where <m> [ \sqrt { 5 } ] ( D ) = ( \sigma _ 1 ( A , B , C ) , \sigma _ 2 ( A , B , C ) , \sigma _ 3 ( A , B , C ) , \sigma _ 4 ( A , B , C ) ) \in J </m> also i have formulae when the input divisor is of the form <m> [ ( x , y ) - \infty ] \in \Theta \subset J </m> my problem is when the input is not in <m> \Theta </m> -LRB- an ordinary , generic divisor -RRB- but the output is in <m> \Theta </m> . my question is , if <m> D : = ( A , B , C , D ) </m> how can i compute if <m> [ \sqrt { 5 } ] ( D ) \in \Theta </m> , and more ... how can i compute the resulting divisor ? detecting it i think is easy , i just need to calculate a determinant of a <m> 4 \times 4 </m> matrix in terms of <m> A , B , C </m> . but i do not know how to compute the divisor using my coefficients <m> ( A , B , C , D ) </m> . is there a way to get explicit formulae for this `` exceptional case '' when is already known that the image will be in <m> \Theta </m> ? thanks
this question was originally posted to math.stackexchange , but having got no response there , i 'm reposting it here . i apologise if it is too elementary for this site . -LRB- original https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/170310/calculating-hng-mathbbzg-as-co-homology-with-compact-support-of-a-prope -RRB- i came across the following exercise in brown 's book `` co-homology of groups '' , and have been completely unable to solve it . if anyone could give me a hint that would point me in the right direction i would really appreciate it . i could n't even think of a filtration of <m> X </m> which might produce a useful spectral sequence . brown `` co-homology of groups '' , section viii .7 , p. 209 , ex 4 :

we know that blowing up a point on a surface produces a <m> ( - 1 ) </m> curve . is there any such standard techniques to produce <m> ( - 2 ) </m> curves in a smooth surface ?
let <m> \lfloor x \rfloor </m> be the floor function . question : does the determinant <m> D _ p = \det \left [ \left \lfloor \frac { i ^ 2 + j ^ 2 } p \right \rfloor \right ] _ { 1 \le i , j \le ( p - 1 ) / 2 } </m> vanish for each prime <m> p > 7 </m> with <m> p \equiv 3 \pmod 4 </m> ? my comptation suggests that the answer should be positive . any ideas ?
i am reading this paper by s.h karin titled norm attaining operators and pseudospectrum . in page 2 he gives the definition of <m> l _ p </m> direct sum of a family of banach spaces as follows : if <m> 1 \leq p < \infty </m> and <m> \{ X _ \alpha \} _ { \alpha \in \Lambda } </m> is a faily of banach spaces , then their <m> l _ p </m> direct sum is the space <m> X = \bigg \{ x \in \prod \limits _ { \alpha \in \Lambda } X _ \alpha : \sum \limits _ { \alpha \in \Lambda } \| x _ \alpha \| ^ p < \infty \bigg \} </m> endowed with the norm <m> \| x \| = \left ( \sum \limits _ { \alpha \in \Lambda } \| x _ \alpha \| ^ p \right ) ^ { \frac { 1 } { p } } . </m> i want to ask if <m> X _ \alpha </m> can be non zero for all <m> \alpha \in \Lambda </m> ? can <m> \Lambda </m> be an uncountable set ?
suppose that <m> f : { \bf C } \mapsto { \bf C } </m> is a <m> C ^ \infty </m> function such that <m> f ( z ) \in \overline { { \bf Q } ( z ) } </m> for all <m> z \in { \bf C } </m> , ie <m> f ( z ) </m> is algebraic over the field <m> { \bf Q } ( z ) </m> generated by <m> z </m> over <m> { \bf Q } </m> , for all <m> z \in { \bf C } </m> . is it true that <m> f ( z ) \in \bar { \bf Q } [ z ] </m> , in other words , that <m> f ( z ) </m> is a polynomial function in <m> z </m> , with coefficients in <m> \bar { \bf Q } </m> ? one of my colleagues sketched an argument showing that this is true , which uses baire 's category theorem . i would like to know if anybody knows a reference for this result in the mathematical literature -LRB- or possibly a counterexample - i have n't checked his argument in detail -RRB- . this question is related to the question maps preserving algebraic numbers but the properties requested from <m> f </m> are stronger here .
i found 8 of them and believe there is no more : <m> 2 + 3 ^ 2 = 3 + 2 ^ 3 </m> <m> 2 + 6 ^ 2 = 6 + 2 ^ 5 </m> <m> 6 + 1 5 ^ 2 = 1 5 + 6 ^ 3 </m> <m> 3 + 1 6 ^ 2 = 1 6 + 3 ^ 5 </m> <m> 3 + 1 3 ^ 3 = 1 3 + 3 ^ 7 </m> <m> 2 + 9 1 ^ 2 = 9 1 + 2 ^ { 1 3 } </m> <m> 5 + 2 8 0 ^ 2 = 2 8 0 + 5 ^ 7 </m> <m> 3 0 + 4 9 3 0 ^ 2 = 4 9 3 0 + 3 0 ^ 5 </m> i call the solution a principal pipe of order 2 . any idea to attack this equation ? if <m> n = x = 2 </m> , it becomes <m> 2 + y ^ 2 = y + 2 ^ m </m> . it is ramanujan and nagell equation , and there are only 3 solutions . if <m> n = 2 </m> and <m> x \geq 3 </m> , then we can use the similar way to prove that there is no other solution for <m> x < 1 0 0 0 0 </m> with help of computer . if <m> n = 3 </m> , and we assume <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> are prime , and <m> 6 \mid ( m - 1 ) </m> , then the solution is <m> 3 + 1 3 ^ 3 = 1 3 + 3 ^ 7 = 2 2 0 0 </m> . i believe there is no solution for <m> n > 3 </m> . i am particularly interested in solutions that both <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> are odd primes .

the proper forcing axiom kills ch in a particularly specific way : it implies that <m> 2 ^ { \aleph _ 0 } = \aleph _ 2 </m> . however , its impact on the continuum function above <m> \aleph _ 0 </m> is much less clear . it is known , for example , that it implies the singular cardinal hypothesis , sch . in this paper -LRB- see page 2 -RRB- , aspero writes that magidor showed the following :
assume that for some <m> n \in \mathbb { N } </m> i have a -LRB- possibly singular -RRB- irreducible , non-degenerate complex surface <m> X _ n \subset \mathbb { P } ^ { N } </m> with the following properties :
let <m> \bar { \rho } </m> denote the reduced regular representation of <m> \mathbb { Z } / p </m> over a field of characteristic <m> p </m> . the representation <m> \mathrm { S y m } ^ k \bar { \rho } </m> decomposes -LRB- for each <m> k </m> -RRB- as a sum of indecomposable representations of <m> \mathbb { Z } / p </m> . -LRB- recall that the indecomposable representations of <m> \mathbb { Z } / p </m> over a field of characteristic <m> p </m> are classified via the jordan decomposition , and are determined by a dimension between <m> 1 </m> and <m> p </m> . -RRB- the precise decomposition is claimed -LRB- without proof -RRB- in in prop. 5.2.1 of mike hill 's thesis . as i 'm a little confused about the grading , i do n't want to write it out here . does anyone have a reference with a proof of this decomposition ?
can <m> n </m> circles on a plane generate <m> m </m> intersection points where at least <m> k </m> circles intersect ? for <m> k = 2 </m> the answer is obvious since we can always place circles so that every one of them intersects every other , generating in total at most <m> 2 { n \choose { 2 } } </m> intersection points of <m> 2 </m> circles . what can we say for <m> k = 3 </m> ? in particular i am interested in <m> n = 7 </m> , <m> m = 1 2 </m> . it is known -LRB- see figure -RRB- that <m> 8 </m> circles can generate <m> 1 2 </m> intersection points of at least <m> 3 </m> circles .
i posted this question on math stackexchange but did not get a full answer . i hope it 's not a problem if i ask again here . is there a way to compute explicitly the <m> L </m> − rank <m> \rho ( \bigcup x ) </m> of <m> \bigcup x </m> in terms of <m> \rho ( x ) </m> ? i know it 's necessarily <m> \rho ( \bigcup x ) \leq \rho ( x ) </m> and that both <m> \rho ( \bigcup x ) < \rho ( x ) </m> and <m> \rho ( \bigcup x ) = \rho ( x ) </m> can hold , but what else can be said , maybe distinguishing between <m> \rho ( x ) </m> limit ordinal and successor ordinal ? for example , is it possible that equality holds if <m> \rho ( x ) </m> is a successor ordinal ? if so , could you give an example ?
hello , im looking at primes of the form <m> x ^ 2 + n y ^ 2 </m> for <m> n > 1 </m> where we can swap <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> and get another prime , i have found many such pairs for many values of n , and i wanted to know if there are any known results about these prime pairs and also if it is known whether there are infinitely many of these pairs -LRB- which seems to be the case -RRB- , or if this follows from a known conjecture . now if i call <m> q </m> a ` friend ' of <m> p </m> if <m> p = x ^ 2 + n y ^ 2 </m> and <m> q = y ^ 2 + n x ^ 2 </m> -LRB- with <m> x , y , n </m> the same -RRB- and they are both primes , then i also found ` friends ' for <m> p </m> with different values of <m> n </m> i.e i can also write <m> p = w ^ 2 + d z ^ 2 </m> and <m> q ' = z ^ 2 + d w ^ 2 </m> and q ' is again a prime so for example <m> 6 1 = 7 ^ 2 + 3 \times 2 ^ 2 </m> and <m> 1 5 1 = 2 ^ 2 + 3 \times 7 ^ 2 </m> , so id call 151 a ` friend ' of 61 but also i have <m> 6 1 = 5 ^ 2 + 4 \times 3 ^ 2 </m> and <m> 1 0 9 = 3 ^ 2 + 4 \times 5 ^ 2 </m> so 109 is also a ` friend ' of 61 , hence 61 has 2 friends , now i know this is a long shot but i bet that there exist primes with arbitrarily large amounts of ` friends ' , i wanted to know if there are any results or conjectures to do with this . the prime with most friends ive found is 12541 which has a friend for <m> n = 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 1 3 , 1 5 , 2 0 , 4 5 , 5 7 , 6 9 , 1 0 0 , 1 6 5 , 2 2 0 , 2 4 5 </m> thank you
emil artin knew that given a finite extension of <m> L / \mathbb { Q } </m> , the local factor of the zeta function <m> \zeta _ { L / \mathbb { Q } } </m> at the prime <m> p </m> should be <m> \displaystyle \prod _ { \mathfrak { p } | p } \frac { 1 } { 1 - N ( \mathfrak { p } ) ^ { - s } } </m> . he also knew that if <m> L / K </m> is a class field then <m> \displaystyle \prod _ { \mathfrak { P } | \mathfrak { p } } \frac { 1 } { 1 - N ( \mathfrak { P } ) ^ { - s } } = \displaystyle \prod _ { \chi } \frac { 1 } { 1 - \chi { ( F r o b { _ \mathfrak { p } ) } } \cdot N ( \mathfrak { p } ) ^ { - s } } </m> where <m> \mathfrak { P } </m> runs over all primes in <m> L </m> lying above <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> and <m> \chi </m> runs over all characters of <m> G a l ( L / K ) </m> . it 's natural then to
it is well known that <m> 4 </m> general points in <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 2 </m> are complete intersection of two conics . on the other hand , if <m> d \geq 3 </m> , <m> d ^ 2 </m> general points are not a complete intersection of two curves of degree <m> d </m> . more precisely , if <m> d = 3 </m> there is only one cubic passing through <m> 9 </m> general points , whereas if <m> d \geq 4 </m> there is no curve of degree <m> d </m> passing through <m> d ^ 2 </m> general points . while investigating some questions about factoriality of singular hypersurfaces of <m> \mathbb { P } ^ n </m> , i ran across the following problem , which seems quite natural to state .
i would like to know the irreducible representations of the group <m> G _ 4 = \langle a , b \mid a ^ { 1 6 } , b ^ 2 , b a b a ^ { - 7 } \rangle </m> and its character table . more than that , i would like to know the irreducible representations of the general group <m> G _ m = \langle a , b \mid a ^ { 2 ^ { m } } , b ^ 2 , b a b a ^ { - d } \rangle </m> where <m> d = 2 ^ { m - 1 } - 1 </m> . i would be grateful if you could help me and indicate some references .
let <m> d _ k ( n ) </m> denote the number of ways of expressing <m> n </m> as a product of <m> k </m> factors , and let <m> D _ k ( x ) = \sum _ { n \leq x } d _ k ( n ) </m> be the summatory function . during a study of mertens ' function i was lead to consider the zero distribution of the sequence of polynomials <m> P ( z , x ) = \sum _ { j = 0 } ^ { m } \left ( \sum _ { k = j } ^ { m } { m + 1 \choose k - j } ( - 1 ) ^ { m - k } D _ { m + 1 - k } ( x ) \right ) z ^ j </m> of degree <m> m = m ( x ) = \max \{ \Omega ( n ) : n \leq x \} \sim \log _ 2 x </m> .
over any model m of <m> P A ^ - + I \Sigma _ 1 ^ 0 </m> . suppose <m> A \in [ T ] </m> where <m> T </m> is a <m> \Delta _ 2 ^ 0 </m> - tree and <m> A </m> is one isolated path . further , <m> A </m> is regular , i.e. <m> \forall n A \upharpoonright n </m> has a code in <m> M </m> . a is easily seen to be <m> \Delta _ 2 ^ 0 </m> . my question is does there exist a nice recursive approximation <m> \langle A _ s \rangle </m> of a such that <m> \forall n \exists t \forall s > t A _ s \upharpoonright n = A \upharpoonright n </m> ? this property could be expected for any <m> \Delta _ 2 ^ 0 </m> set in any <m> P A ^ - + B \Sigma _ 2 ^ 0 </m> model . however , i 'm wondering if being an isolated path is enough restriction to force this nice property in <m> P A ^ - + I \Sigma _ 1 ^ 0 </m> . edit : there might be some further restriction on the tree that i left out . otherwise as françois pointed out the restriction is vacuous . let 's say <m> T = \{ \tau \in 2 ^ { < M } : \forall u < | \tau | K ( \tau \upharpoonright u ) < K ( u ) + b \} </m> where <m> K </m> is the prefix-free kolmogorov complexity -LRB- it could be defined in models of fragments of arithmetic -RRB- and b is a constant . actually , it corresponds to the k-trivial set via constant <m> b </m> as in the standard case .
i 'm sure this is something silly but i am trying to understand the following paper http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0001870807001636# and something is not clear to me . the paper starts with `` irreducible polynomial representations of <m> G L ( r ) </m> are indexed by sequences <m> \lambda = ( \lambda _ 1 \geq \ldots \geq \lambda _ r \geq 0 ) \in \mathbb { Z } ^ r </m> '' . i do n't understand why we ca n't have negative entries for the highest weight ? i mean , if <m> V </m> is the natural representation of <m> G L ( V ) </m> is n't <m> V ^ * </m> also an irreducible polynomial representation ? am i missing something here , perhaps some correspondence between <m> r </m> - tuples where <m> r = \dim V </m> ?
let <m> B </m> be the borel subgroup of <m> G = \text { G L } _ 2 \big ( \Bbb { R } \big ) </m> , let <m> { \bf \alpha } : B \longrightarrow \Bbb { C } ^ * </m> be a character , and consider the induced representation <m> \text { I n d } _ B ^ G ( { \bf \alpha } ) </m> of <m> G </m> . without getting into analytic technicalities , is it possible to interpret this induced representation as the space of solutions to a dirichlet problem in the upper half-plane <m> \frak { H } </m> whose boundary conditions -LRB- one for each solution -RRB- vary over some appropriate family of functions on the boundary <m> \Bbb { R } \cup \{ \infty \} </m> ? specifically , given a vector <m> v </m> in <m> \text { I n d } _ B ^ G ( { \bf \alpha } ) </m> is there a real-valued function <m> f _ v : \Bbb { R } \longrightarrow \Bbb { R } </m> with some regulation on its behaviour at <m> \infty </m> such that the solution <m> u _ v : \frak { H } \longrightarrow \Bbb { R } </m> to the dirichlet problem <m> \Delta _ { \frak { H } } u _ v = 0 </m> with <m> u _ v { \big | } _ { \Bbb { R } } = f _ v </m> lives in the standard upper-half plane model <m> V _ { \bf \alpha } \subset L ^ 2 \big ( \frak { H } \big ) </m> for the induced representation , and as <m> v </m> varies -LRB- and <m> f _ v </m> varies respectively over this appropriate class of boundary conditions -RRB- the corresponding solutions <m> u _ v </m> fill up this standard model <m> V _ { \bf \alpha } </m> ? regards , ines
what is the dual group of the additive group of rational numbers equipped with the standard topology inherited from <m> \mathbb R </m> ? as a group , this dual group is isomorphic to <m> \mathbb R </m> -LRB- see the answer of ekedahl given below -RRB- , but it should be equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of <m> \mathbb Q </m> . what are the properties of this group ? is it locally compact ? what are its connected components ? does it have more natural structure ?
let <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> be a finite-dimensional complex semisimple lie algebra , and let <m> \phi _ 1 : \mathfrak { s l } _ 2 ( \mathbb { C } ) \rightarrow \mathfrak { g } </m> and <m> \phi _ { 2 } : \mathfrak { s l } _ 2 ( \mathbb { C } ) \rightarrow \mathfrak { g } </m> be complex lie algebra morphisms . by composing <m> \phi _ 1 </m> and <m> \phi _ 2 </m> with the adjoint representation of <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> , we obtain two representations of <m> \mathfrak { s l } _ 2 ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> on <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> . my question is then the following . question : if these two <m> \mathfrak { s l } _ 2 ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> - representations are isomorphic , does it follow that <m> \phi _ 1 </m> and <m> \phi _ 2 </m> are related by an element of the lie algebra automorphism group <m> \text { A u t } ( \mathfrak { g } ) </m> ? to provide some context , suppose that <m> \mathfrak { g } = \mathfrak { s o } _ { 4 n } ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> . if <m> \lambda </m> is a partition of <m> 4 n </m> having only even parts with each part appearing an even number of times , then <m> \lambda </m> corresponds to exactly two distinct nilpotent orbits , <m> \mathcal { O } _ 1 </m> and <m> \mathcal { O } _ 2 </m> , in <m> \mathfrak { s o } _ { 4 n } ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> . now , let <m> \phi _ 1 : \mathfrak { s l } _ 2 ( \mathbb { C } ) \rightarrow \mathfrak { s o } _ { 4 n } ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> and <m> \phi _ 2 : \mathfrak { s l } _ 2 ( \mathbb { C } ) \rightarrow \mathfrak { s o } _ { 4 n } ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> be lie algebra maps satisfying <m> \phi _ 1 ( e ) \in \mathcal { O } _ 1 </m> and <m> \phi _ 2 ( e ) \in \mathcal { O } _ 2 </m> . as discussed above , each map gives a representation of <m> \mathfrak { s l } _ 2 ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> on <m> \mathfrak { s o } _ { 4 n } ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> . these two representations are actually isomorphic . while <m> \phi _ 1 </m> and <m> \phi _ 2 </m> can not be related by an inner automorphism of <m> \mathfrak { s o } _ { 4 n } ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> -LRB- as <m> \mathcal { O } _ 1 \neq \mathcal { O } _ 2 </m> -RRB- , they are nevertheless related by a lie algebra automorphism .
while on some work on symmetric functions , we encountered <m> f ( a , b ) = \frac { a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 } { 1 + a b } </m> is an integer iff it is a perfect square , where <m> ( a , b ) \in \mathbb { N } ^ 2 </m> . well , it turns out that this is a well-known -LRB- well-documented -RRB- problem . so , i propose a slight alteration to the question :
let <m> \varphi \colon ( \mathbb C ^ * ) ^ m \times \mathbb A ^ n \to \mathbb A ^ n </m> be an algebraic effective action of a torus on affine space and <m> X </m> be a zariski closure of an orbit of this action . suppose we also have an algebraic action <m> \psi \colon \mathbb C ^ * \times X \to X </m> of one-dimensional torus on <m> X </m> . does always exist a morphism <m> f \colon \mathbb C ^ * \to ( \mathbb C ^ * ) ^ m </m> such that <m> \psi = \varphi \circ f </m> ?
what is the state-of-art of the following question ? let <m> p </m> be any prime number . for any finite <m> p </m> - group <m> G </m> , let <m> r _ G </m> denote the minimum number of defining relators in all presentations of <m> G </m> over minimal generating sets of <m> G </m> . let <m> R _ G </m> denote the dimension of the second cohomology group of <m> G </m> mod <m> p </m> . question : is there a finite <m> p </m> - group <m> G </m> such that <m> r _ G > R _ G </m> ? has it been checked for all <m> 2 </m> - groups of order at most <m> 2 ^ { 1 0 } </m> or other small <m> p </m> - groups which we know them by the small group library of gap ? is a possible example studied to have certain properties ? e.g. must it be of nilpotency class at least <m> 3 </m> ?
background/motivation : one of the usual constructions of -LSB- the adjoint representation of -RSB- the <m> E _ 8 </m> exceptional lie group -LRB- found , e.g. , in j. f. adams 's , `` lectures on exceptional lie groups '' , esp . chap . 6 -- 7 -RRB- consists of starting from <m> \mathit { S p i n } ( 1 6 ) </m> and taking the direct sum of the latter 's adjoint representation and one half-spin representation -LRB- it remains , of course , to construct a lie bracket on this direct sum , but at least three of the four cases to consider are clear -RRB- . the reason for this approach is that this direct sum is the branching of the adjoint representation of <m> E _ 8 </m> -LRB- to be constructed -RRB- to its maximal subgroup <m> D _ 8 = \mathit { S p i n } ( 1 6 ) </m> . the branching <m> E _ 8 \to D _ 8 </m> is arguably the most manageable one , so it makes sense to use it to construct <m> D _ 8 </m> . however , branching to the <m> A _ 8 </m> subgroup is also intelligible , so i ask : question : given that the adjoint representation of <m> E _ 8 </m> , restricted to its maximal subgroup <m> A _ 8 </m> -LRB- meaning <m> \mathit { S L } ( 9 ) </m> or <m> \mathit { S U } ( 9 ) </m> according as we are working with complex or real compact lie groups -RRB- , decomposes as <m> \bigwedge ^ 3 V \oplus \bigwedge ^ 3 V ^ * \oplus W </m> where <m> V </m> is the -LRB- <m> 9 </m> - dimensional -RRB- natural representation of <m> A _ 8 </m> , <m> V ^ * </m> is its dual , and <m> W </m> is the -LRB- <m> 8 0 </m> - dimensional -RRB- adjoint representation of <m> A _ 8 </m> -LRB- the nontrivial factor in <m> V \otimes V ^ * </m> -RRB- , is there an explicit description of a lie bracket on <m> \bigwedge ^ 3 V \oplus \bigwedge ^ 3 V ^ * \oplus W </m> that constructs <m> E _ 8 </m> ? is this description somewhere to be found in the literature ? -LRB- to be honest , what i am really interested in is how to get an intuitive grasp of this branching . but i presume the easiest way to do that is to use it to construct <m> E _ 8 </m> , rather than hope to describe it starting from some other construction of <m> E _ 8 </m> . however , any such description counts as an answer to this question . -RRB-
consider <m> \mathbf { Q } ( x , y ) </m> , the rational functions in <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> , as a vector space over <m> \mathbf { Q } </m> . let <m> \sigma </m> be the map interchanging <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> . is there a basis for <m> \mathbf { Q } ( x , y ) </m> which is invariant under <m> \sigma </m> ? motivation : a negative answer to this question would give a negative answer to that question too . the obvious way to construct a basis for <m> \mathbf { Q } ( x , y ) </m> starts from <m> \{ </m> monomials <m> \ / \ </m> irreducibles <m> \} </m> , but then we have to choose one of <m> 1 / ( x - y ) </m> and <m> 1 / ( y - x ) </m> , and a basis ca n't symmetrically include both .
let 's say general relativity is the study of the einstein equation on smooth lorentzian manifolds , i.e. pseudo-riemannian manifolds of signature <m> ( n - 1 , 1 ) </m> . i 've heard more than once people say that the reason why there are many non-diffeomorphic smooth structures on <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> only for <m> n = 4 </m> would be somehow `` related to the fact that the spacetime in which we live is <m> 4 </m> - dimensional '' . or , on the other hand , that there are exotic smooth structures only on <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 4 </m> because `` that 's the dimension of spacetime '' .
let <m> k </m> be a field of characteristic <m> 0 </m> and let <m> E : y ^ 2 = f ( x ) </m> be an elliptic curve over <m> k </m> , with <m> \mathrm { d e g } ( f ) = 3 </m> . kummer theory yields a map <m> \varphi : \mathrm { H } ^ 1 ( k , E [ 2 ] ) \to \mathrm { H } ^ 1 ( k , E ) [ 2 ] . </m> in particular , to each element <m> c \in \mathrm { H } ^ 1 ( k , E [ 2 ] ) </m> we may associate a principal homogeneous space for <m> E </m> .
i have a transformation <m> T \in S E ( 3 ) </m> parameterized by a mean quaternion <m> q </m> with covariance matrix <m> \Sigma _ q \in R ^ { 4 \times 4 } </m> and a mean translation <m> t \in R ^ 3 </m> with covariance matrix <m> \Sigma _ t \in R ^ { 3 \times 3 } </m> . if i were to transform some point <m> p _ 1 \in R ^ 3 </m> by <m> T </m> , i can easily compute its euclidean distance to some second point <m> p _ 2 \in R ^ 3 </m> as <m> \lVert T p _ 1 - p _ 2 \rVert </m> . what i would like to do instead is incorporate the covariance matrices of my transformation to compute a distance measure similar in function to a mahalanobis distance . is there a closed form way to do this ? 2d example to help clarify , i 've plotted the problem in a two dimensional world below , where points are in <m> R ^ 2 </m> , and transforms are in <m> S E ( 2 ) </m> . here , a point <m> p _ 1 </m> can be transformed by <m> T </m> to find a point <m> T p _ 1 </m> . however , because we know the covariances of the rotation and translation , we can see that random samples of <m> T p _ 1 </m> would be distributed according to the banana shaped distribution shown in red . what i would like to find then is a distance measure that would will take these covariances into account such that <m> p _ 2 </m> would be significantly `` closer '' than <m> p _ 3 </m> to <m> T p _ 1 </m> .
i am trying to prove that the following are equivalent for a group <m> G </m> with periodic cohomology with period <m> q </m> after <m> k </m> steps : <m> ( i ) \ s p l i G < \infty </m> -LRB- where <m> s p l i G </m> is the supremum of injective length of <m> \mathbb { Z } G </m> - projective modules -RRB- <m> ( i i ) </m> there is an element <m> g \in H ^ q ( G , \mathbb { Z } ) </m> such that the cup -LRB- yoneda -RRB- product <m> \ \_ \bigcup g : H ^ i ( G , \_ ) \to H ^ { i + q } ( G , \_ ) </m> is an isomorphism for every <m> i > k </m> it was easy to prove that <m> ( i ) \Longrightarrow ( i i ) </m> , since <m> ( i ) </m> is equivalent to the following : there is a <m> q </m> - extension of the form <m> 0 \to \mathbb { Z } \to X \to P _ { q - 2 } \to \ldots \to P _ 0 \to \mathbb { Z } \to 0 </m> where <m> P _ i </m> is a projective <m> \mathbb { Z } G </m> - module for every <m> i = 0 , 1 , \ldots , q - 2 </m> and <m> p d _ { \mathbb { Z } G } X < \infty </m> . and <m> ( i i ) </m> is equivalent to the following : there is a <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - split , <m> \mathbb { Z } G </m> - exact sequence <m> 0 \to \mathbb { Z } \to X </m> , where <m> X </m> is <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - free and <m> p d _ { \mathbb { Z } G } X < \infty </m> . however , i ca n't figure out how to prove <m> ( i i ) \Longrightarrow ( i ) </m> . any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated . thank you . edit : there is a mistake in the original question . <m> ( i ) </m> and <m> ( i i ) </m> have been interchanged . actually , the fact that the periodicity isomorphisms are induced by cup product with an element <m> g \in H ^ q ( G , \mathbb { Z } </m> is equivalent to the existence of a <m> q </m> - extension <m> 0 \to \mathbb { Z } \to X \to P _ { q - 2 } \to \ldots \to P _ 0 \to \mathbb { Z } \to 0 </m> where <m> P _ i </m> is a projective <m> \mathbb { Z } G </m> - module for every <m> i = 0 , 1 , \ldots , q - 2 </m> and <m> p d _ { \mathbb { Z } G } X < \infty </m> while <m> s p l i G < \infty </m> is equivalent to the existence of a <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - split , <m> \mathbb { Z } G </m> - exact sequence <m> 0 \to \mathbb { Z } \to X </m> , where <m> X </m> is <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - free and <m> p d _ { \mathbb { Z } G } X < \infty </m> . so , the correct question is how to prove that : if <m> G </m> has periodic cohomology with period <m> q </m> after <m> k </m> steps and <m> s p l i G < \infty </m> then there exists a <m> q </m> - extension of the form <m> 0 \to \mathbb { Z } \to X \to P _ { q - 2 } \to \ldots \to P _ 0 \to \mathbb { Z } \to 0 </m> where <m> P _ i </m> is a projective <m> \mathbb { Z } G </m> - module for every <m> i = 0 , 1 , \ldots , q - 2 </m> and <m> p d _ { \mathbb { Z } G } X < \infty </m> . i apologize for the mix-up .

i 'm having trouble understanding the proof given in morgan 's the seiberg-witten equations that every 4-manifold <m> X </m> admits a <m> S p i n ^ c </m> structure -LRB- lemma 3.1.2 -RRB- . one can easily see from the exact sequence : <m> H ^ 1 ( X ; S p i n ^ c ) \to H ^ 1 ( X ; S O ( n ) ) \oplus H ^ 1 ( X ; \mathbb { Z } ) \xrightarrow { c _ 1 + w _ 2 } H ^ 2 ( X ; \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) </m> that a <m> S p i n ^ c </m> structure will exist iff <m> w _ 2 ( T X ) </m> lifts to an integral class , which we can check using bockstein homomorphisms . after that , i 'm lost ; i 'm not sure if these are theorems , or whether they are supposed to be obvious :
given a mapping in the sobolev space <m> f \in W ^ { 2 , n } _ { \rm l o c } ( \mathbb { R } ^ n , \mathbb { R } ^ n ) </m> i would like to know what is the sobolev regularity of the jacobian <m> J _ f = \operatorname { d e t } D f </m> .

this question is related to hankel determinants of harmonic numbers . let <m> f ( n ) = \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ n \frac { 2 ^ k } { k } </m> and <m> r ( n ) = \sum _ { j = 0 } ^ n ( - 2 ) ^ { n - j } \binom { n } { j } \binom { n + j } { j } f ( j ) . </m> in order to compute the hankel determinants <m> \det \left ( f ( i + j ) \right ) _ { i , j = 0 } ^ n </m> i need the following identities : 1 -RRB- <m> r ( 2 n ) = 0 </m> , 2 -RRB- <m> r ( 2 n + 1 ) = ( - 1 ) ^ n \frac { ( 2 n + 1 ) ! } { ( ( 2 n + 1 ) ! ! ) ^ 2 } 2 ^ { 2 n + 2 } . </m> are these identities known ?

we know this important fact from a.a.kirillov that : every homogeneous symplectic <m> G </m> - manifold is locally isomorphic to an orbit in the coadjoint representation of the group <m> G </m> or a central extension of it . but when can we precisely say that a homogeneous symplectic <m> G </m> - manifold is locally isomorphic to an orbit in the coadjoint representation of the group <m> G </m> or a homogeneous symplectic <m> G </m> - manifold is central extension of it ? ps : definition of coadjoint orbit ; let <m> G </m> be a lie group and <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> be its lie algebra , and also <m> \mathfrak { g ^ * } </m> be the dual of lie algebra , the coadjoint orbit is as follows <m> \mathfrak { G } = \{ A d ^ * ( g ) F , g \in G \} </m> where <m> F \in \mathfrak { g ^ * } </m> .
if <m> A </m> is a <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra , there is a notion of hilbert <m> A </m> - module -LRB- which is something like hilbert space but the inner product takes values in <m> A </m> -RRB- . the standard example is <m> H _ A : = \{ ( a _ n ) _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } : \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } a _ n ^ * a _ n \ i s \ n o r m \ c o n v e r g e n t \} </m> with <m> A </m> valued inner product <m> ( a , b ) : = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } a _ n ^ * b _ n </m> . the algebra of all adjointable operators on hilbert module turns out to be a <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra and there is a notion of <m> A </m> compact operator : these are operators which are norm limits of linear combinations of operators of the form <m> \theta _ { x , y } </m> where <m> \theta _ { x , y } ( z ) = x ( y , z ) </m> -LRB- our modules are right modules -RRB- . having the notion of <m> A </m> compact operator one can speak about <m> A </m> fredholm operators -LRB- <m> A </m> - linear -RRB- . let us take <m> A = C ( X ) </m> -LRB- continuous functions on some compact space -RRB- and let <m> T : X \to F r e d ( H ) </m> be a continuous family of fredholm operators on <m> H = \ell ^ 2 </m> .
it is well-known that chebyshev polynomials are the polynomials of minimal <m> L _ \infty </m> norm on -LSB- -1,1 -RSB- with leading coefficient 1 . but what if you want the minimal <m> L _ \infty </m> polynomial on two disjoint intervals <m> [ - 1 , 1 ] </m> and <m> [ a , b ] </m> ? an upper bound can be obtained by seeking the minimal <m> L _ \infty </m> norm polynomial over the `` filled-in '' interval <m> I = [ \min ( - 1 , a ) , \max ( 1 , b ) ] </m> . this would be a translated and scaled chebyshev polynomial . my question is , can you do significantly better than this ? intuitively , can you exploit the fact that there is empty space between <m> [ - 1 , 1 ] </m> and <m> [ a , b ] </m> where the polynomial is not required to have a small value ? or is this empty space essentially useless ? my first instinct was to try a product of scaled chebyshevs which are small on <m> [ - 1 , 1 ] </m> and <m> [ a , b ] </m> respectively . however there is no growth control on one chebyshev in the others ' interval , so there is no guarantee that you are doing any better . because of this i am pessimistic that one can do much better than the upper bound , but i would love to be proven wrong . i am interested in this question because i am studying the convergence of krylov subspace methods , where such approximations play an important role . i want to understand the convergence rate of conjugate gradients when there are multiple clusters of eigenvalues contained in different intervals , rather than just a single cluster .

let <m> p </m> be a prime . it is a common statement that the multiplicative group <m> ( \mathbb { F } _ p ) ^ * </m> of the prime field has no canonical generator . it is however no so easy to say exactly what this means , in particular it is not easy to make the statement fit into the ideas on canonicity that are expressed in the answers to this mo question . thus i would like to find some positive and negative facts concerning the existence , construction , functoriality -LRB- if someone can make sense of it -RRB- of generators of the group <m> ( \mathbb { F } _ p ) ^ * </m> . for example , does anyone know a formula for a generator in terms of <m> p </m> ? maybe is there a theoretical result saying that such a formula can / ca n't exist ? can anyone give an example of a fact that is related to the -LRB- presumed -RRB- non-canonicity of these generators ? -LSB- edit -RSB- in fact , i am more interested in the statement that `` there is no canonical generator '' than in finding `` formulas '' . what i would especially like to see is if someone can cook up a precise statement of non-canonicity and prove it . as an example , we use to say that `` there is no canonical isomorphism between a finite-dimensional vector space and its dual '' and one can in fact prove the precise mathematical statement that there is no functor defined on the category of finite-dim . spaces of a fixed dimension <m> n </m> -LRB- say <m> n \ge 3 </m> for simplicity -RRB- that would take a vector space <m> E </m> to an isomorphism <m> E \to E ^ * </m> .
problem : suppose we have two real , symmetric and positive definite square matrices <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> , i.e. , <m> A _ { i j } , B _ { i j } \in \mathbb { R } </m> <m> A ^ T = A </m> <m> B ^ T = B </m> <m> x ^ T A x > 0 \forall x </m> <m> x ^ T B x > 0 \forall x </m> if <m> A \ge B </m> , i.e. , <m> A - B </m> is semi-postive definite -LRB- <m> x ^ T ( A - B ) x \ge 0 , \, \forall x </m> -RRB- , then is the statement that <m> A ^ { - 1 } \le B ^ { - 1 } </m> true , i.e. <m> A ^ { - 1 } - B ^ { - 1 } \ge 0 </m> -LRB- <m> x ^ T ( B ^ { - 1 } - A ^ { - 1 } ) x \ge 0 , \, \forall x </m> -RRB- remarks : obviously if <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> can be diagonalized simultaneously with the same similarity transformation , then the statement is true . what about the general case ? i tried some numerical examples , it seems the statement is true . but i do n't know how prove it . i would appreciate if anyone can give a proof or point out any reference that has the solution of the above problem . thanks in advance !
suppose <m> X </m> and <m> Y </m> are compact metric spaces . let <m> \varphi \colon C ( X ) \to M _ { n } ( C ( Y ) ) </m> be any <m> * </m> - homomorphism . if <m> \pi </m> is an irreducible representation of <m> M _ { n } ( C ( Y ) ) </m> , then <m> \pi </m> is unitarily equivalent to a point evaluation <m> \textrm { e v } _ { y } </m> . the <m> * </m> - homomorphism <m> \textrm { e v } _ { y } \circ \varphi \colon C ( X ) \to M _ { n } ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> is a representation of <m> C ( X ) </m> . since it 's a finite-dimensional representation , we can find a unitary <m> u _ { y } \in M _ { n } ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> and a set of points <m> X _ { y } = \{ x ^ { y } _ { 1 } , \ldots , x ^ { y } _ { n } \} \subset X </m> such that for all <m> f \in C ( X ) </m> , <m> ( \varphi \circ f ) ( y ) = ( \textrm { e v } _ { y } \circ \varphi ) ( f ) = u _ { y } \begin {pmatrix} f ( x ^ { y } _ { 1 } ) & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & f ( x ^ { y } _ { 2 } ) & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & f ( x ^ { y } _ { n } ) \end {pmatrix} u _ { y } ^ { * } . </m> my question is :
let g be a subgroup of <m> E ( n ) = \mathbb { R } ^ n \rtimes O ( n ) </m> -LRB- the rigid motions of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> -RRB- with orbit space as a point . example : the group of all translations of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> and of course any group containing it . q : 1 . are there other examples of g not containing all the translations ? if such g exist , how many different types are them ? 2 . what about the general propositions of these groups ?
verdier localization is one of the more intuitive ways to localize a triangulated category , `` killing '' a suitable class of objects via a functor which is universal with respect to this property . i would like to know whether it is possible to reproduce the construction of <m> \mathcal { T } / \mathcal C </m> in a <m> \infty </m> - stable setting . it seems a well-established folklore that the category of -LRB- a model for -RRB- stable <m> \infty </m> - categories is stable -LRB- ! -RRB- under this sort of operation , but i ca n't find a reference in lurie ha1 . in the dg model , there is a construction by drinfeld which seems to do the job , but instead i would like to reproduce the fairly general construction of neeman -LRB- triangulated categories -RRB- , ch . 2 . did anybody do this naive construction ? or rather there is a more conceptual approach ? presenting a stable <m> \infty </m> - category via a stable model category , is bousfield -LRB- which is , as far as i understand , only a particular case of verdier -RRB- localization enough to cover `` all '' the interesting cases ?
this is a short question : is it just unproven folklore -LRB- yet -RRB- , or is it definitively known that <m> E _ n </m> - operads are not formal , if the characteristic of the underlying field is not equal to zero ?
are there any general results on the -LRB- integral -RRB- cohomology of fiber bundle , where the fiber is a compact group <m> H </m> -LRB- continuous or discrete -RRB- and the base space is the classifying space <m> B G </m> of another compact group <m> G </m> -LRB- continuous or discrete -RRB- . any literature references is much appreciated . since we have two groups <m> G </m> and <m> H </m> . i wonder if the result can be expressed as group cohomology of the two groups .
may assume field <m> k = \mathbb { C } </m> . let <m> X </m> be an affine variety and <m> G </m> be a reductive group -LRB- may assume connected -RRB- . is the ring of invariants <m> k [ X ] ^ G </m> integral closed in <m> k [ X ] </m> ? the claim may not true in general , probably we may assume <m> X </m> is normal and the affine quotient <m> X / G </m> also normal . any reference ?
is there a model of <m> { \sf Z F } </m> such that there is an infinite set <m> X </m> and a injective map <m> f : { \cal P } ( X ) \to { \cal P } ( X ) </m> so that for <m> a \neq b \in { \cal P } ( X ) </m> we have <m> | f ( a ) \cap f ( b ) | \leq 1 </m> ?
this is the first question asked in bestvina 's article `` questions in geometric group theory '' . does anyone know if there has been any progress made on this problem ? is the question answered if <m> G </m> is instead automatic and contains no subgroups isomorphic to <m> \mathbb { Z } \times \mathbb { Z } </m> ? if the first question is open , can someone clarify what is meant by `` admit finite <m> k ( G , 1 ) </m> '' -LRB- is <m> G </m> the fundamental group of a space with trivial higher homotopy groups or is the action of <m> G </m> on the space properly discontinuous -RRB- ? any helpful references would be great .
let <m> n </m> be a positive integer greater than <m> 1 </m> , and define the polynomial <m> p _ { n } ( x ) = \sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { n } \dfrac { x ^ k } { k ! } </m>
consider the following <m> 1 </m> st order eigen ode system of 2 components <m> ( \alpha , \beta ) ( x ) </m> defined for <m> x \in [ 0 , L ] </m> <m> F _ { l + 1 } \beta + m \alpha = \lambda \alpha \, F _ { - l } \alpha - m \beta = \lambda \beta </m> where <m> \lambda </m> is the eigenvalue , <m> l </m> is integer , <m> m ( 0 ) </m> is finite and <m> m ( L ) \rightarrow \infty </m> , and <m> F _ k = - i ( \frac { d } { d x } + \frac { k } { x } ) </m> . since it is just <m> 1 </m> st order , i thought only 2 boundary conditions -LRB- b.c. -RRB- are necessary , which can be most easily taken as <m> ( \alpha , \beta ) ( L ) = 0 </m> since <m> m ( L ) </m> diverges . so one does n't need or just should n't involve b.c. at <m> x = 0 </m> ? however , on the other hand , if i do the very simple asymptotic analysis at <m> x \rightarrow 0 </m> for these equations , i find that <m> l \neq 0 , - 1 \qquad ( \alpha , \beta ) ( 0 ) = 0 \, l = - 1 \qquad ( \alpha , \beta ' ) ( 0 ) = 0 </m> with <m> l = 0 </m> similar to <m> l = - 1 </m> . what i did is basically just noting that , when <m> k \neq 0 </m> , any component acted by <m> F _ k </m> is <m> 0 </m> at <m> x = 0 </m> . and using this , we notice the other component 's derivative vanishes . it seems that b.c. at <m> x = 0 </m> is natural as well . how to reconcile these two considerations ? where am i wrong ? and if <m> m ( x ) </m> is always finite and smooth enough , is the asymptotic analysis the correct b.c. ?
mostly , for the functions in the fast growing hierachy , lower bounds are given like <m> f _ k ( n ) > 2 \uparrow ^ { k - 1 } n </m> but what abour -LRB- reasonable tight -RRB- upper bounds ? what are the best known upper bounds for <m> f _ k ( n ) </m> ? the functions in the fast growing hierachy are defined as follows <m> f _ 0 ( n ) = n + 1 </m> <m> f _ { k + 1 } = f _ k ^ n ( n ) = f _ k ( f _ k ( . . . n ) . . . ) </m> where <m> f _ k </m> appears n times . so <m> f _ 1 ( n ) = 2 n </m> <m> f _ 2 ( n ) = n 2 ^ n </m> <m> f _ 3 ( n ) \ge 2 \uparrow 2 \uparrow . . . \uparrow 2 \uparrow n </m> with n 2 's and so on .
in https://www.math.ksu.edu/~cochrane/research/xyuvmodp.pdf it is shown <m> x _ 1 x _ 2 = x _ 3 x _ 4 \bmod p </m> where <m> p </m> is a prime has <m> \frac { | \mathcal B | } p + O ( \sqrt { | \mathcal B | } \log ^ 2 p ) </m> solutions <m> ( x _ 1 , x _ 2 , x _ 3 , x _ 4 ) \in \mathcal B </m> where <m> \mathcal B = \mathcal I _ 1 \times \mathcal I _ 2 \times \mathcal I _ 3 \times \mathcal I _ 4 </m> with <m> \mathcal I _ i = [ a _ i , b _ i ] \cap \Bbb N </m> for some <m> a _ i < b _ i </m> ? is it possible to replace prime <m> p </m> with composite <m> n </m> in here ? i also want <m> g c d ( x _ 1 , x _ 3 ) = g c d ( x _ 2 , x _ 4 ) = 1 </m> .
first , some quick notation : for any series <m> \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty a _ n </m> whose terms are positive real numbers , and for any subset <m> M = \{ m _ 1 , m _ 2 , . . . \} \subseteq \mathbb { N } </m> , we write <m> \sum _ M a _ n </m> to mean <m> a _ { m _ 1 } + a _ { m _ 2 } + . . . . </m> . then , for each series , one can associate a topology on <m> \mathbb { N } </m> by declaring a proper subset <m> M \subsetneq \mathbb { N } </m> to be closed iff <m> \sum _ M a _ n < \infty </m> . so , e.g. , in the <m> \sum \frac { 1 } { n } </m> - topology , the set of even numbers is neither open nor closed -LRB- both <m> \sum \frac { 1 } { 2 n + 1 } </m> and <m> \sum \frac { 1 } { 2 n } </m> diverge -RRB- , but the set of squares is closed -LRB- <m> \sum \frac { 1 } { n ^ 2 } </m> converges -RRB- . there is , of course , an interplay between the topological properties <m> \mathbb { N } </m> inherits and the analytic properties of <m> \sum a _ n </m> . for instance , <m> \mathbb { N } </m> gets the cofinite topology iff <m> \liminf a _ n > 0 </m> . much less trivially , one can show that this association generates precisely <m> | \mathbb { R } | </m> many topologies on <m> \mathbb { N } </m> -LRB- distinct up to homeomorphism -RRB- . in fact , for <m> 0 \leq p < q \leq 1 </m> , the spaces obtained from <m> \sum \frac { 1 } { x ^ p } </m> and <m> \sum \frac { 1 } { x ^ q } </m> are not homeomorphic . i am not a general topologist by training so my question is probably very simple . has anything like this appeared in the literature before ? mathscinet does n't seem to turn up anything , but maybe there is some terminology i need to know . maybe these form a subclass in some well studied class of topological spaces ? in case it helps , here are some curious data points about these topological spaces .
motivation and background this question is motivated by the problem of classifying the -LRB- two-sided -RRB- closed ideals of the banach algebra <m> \mathcal { B } ( L _ \infty ) </m> of all -LRB- bounded , linear -RRB- operators on <m> L _ \infty </m> <m> ( = L _ \infty [ 0 , 1 ] ) </m> . as far as i am aware , the only known nontrivial ideals in <m> \mathcal { B } ( L _ \infty ) </m> are the ideals <m> \mathcal { K } ( L _ \infty ) </m> of compact operators and <m> \mathcal { W } ( L _ \infty ) </m> of weakly compact operators . most of the other well-known closed operator ideals not containing the identity operator of <m> L _ \infty </m> seem to coincide with one of these two operator ideals on <m> L _ \infty </m> . let me mention explicitly the following further relevant pieces of background information :
suppose <m> \mu </m> and <m> \nu </m> are two probability measures on <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> . let their <m> n </m> - th moments be denoted by <m> \mu _ n </m> and <m> \nu _ n </m> , respectively , for <m> n \in \mathbb { N } </m> . if we know that <m> \mu _ n = \nu _ n </m> for infinitely many <m> n </m> , can we conclude that <m> \mu = \nu </m> ? one way to resolve this would be to see if the span of <m> \{ x ^ n \mid n \in S \} </m> with <m> | S | = \infty </m> is dense in the set of continuous functions <m> C [ 0 , 1 ] </m> . is such a set always dense ?
see smooth manifold with non-trivial inertia group ? -LRB- wrt homotopy spheres -RRB- for the definition of <m> \Theta _ n </m> and inertia subgroups . i 'm wondering what can be said about lie groups . if <m> M ^ n </m> is an n-dimensional manifold with lie group structure and <m> \Sigma ^ n </m> is a homotopy n-sphere , is there a lie group structure on <m> M \# \Sigma </m> that is in some sense compatible with the original structure ? if this new group structure is isomorphic to the old structure , this implies lie group isomorphism , correct ? what i would like to see is that there is a canonically induced lie group structure on <m> M \# \Sigma </m> and that this structure is isomorphic to that of <m> M </m> , and hence the inertia group for lie groups is the full <m> \Theta ^ n </m>
let <m> g </m> be exponential generating function such that <m> g ( x ) = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { + \infty } a _ { n } \frac { x ^ n } { n ! } </m> extended by analytic continuation along <m> \mathbb { R + } </m> and has a positive radius of convergence . we assume <m> a _ { n } </m> is increasing sequence such that <m> a _ { n } > n ! </m> for <m> n > 1 </m> . my question here is to ask about convergence of the integral below in general under the given conditions .
the bott periodicity theorem can be formulated as the existence of homotopy equivalences <m> \Omega ^ 2 ( K U ) \equiv K U </m> and <m> \Omega ^ 8 ( K O ) = K O </m> . i always wondered whether this theorem could also be transferred to the other completions of <m> Q </m> , i. e. the <m> p </m> - adic fields . of course , since the topology of <m> \mathbb Q ^ p </m> behaves rather incompatibly with the topology of , say , <m> C W </m> complexes , it 's not really clear how to make sense of that . -LRB- the classifying space of the topological group should have the same homotopy groups as the classifying space constructed from the underlying discrete group , if i 'm not mistaken -RRB- . therefore a more sophisticated approach -LRB- possibly via <m> p </m> - adic rigid geometry -RRB- might be necessary . so , does there exist anything which could be considered as the <m> p </m> - adic analogue of bott periodicity ? as i understood it , the underlying algebraic reason for the lengths of the period in the real and complex case , respectively -RRB- is that the sequence of clifford algebras <m> C l ( k , n ) </m> exhibits the same periodicity behaviour up to morita equivalence -LRB- precisely , <m> C l ( k + 8 , \mathbb R ) = M ( C l ( k , \mathbb R ) , 8 ) </m> and <m> C l ( k + 2 , \mathbb R ) = M ( C l ( k , \mathbb R ) , 2 ) </m> . a quick check in the literature shows that the clifford algebras over <m> \mathbb Q _ p </m> are also periodic of length <m> 2 </m> if <m> p \equiv 3 \mod 4 </m> , <m> 4 </m> if <m> p \equiv 1 \mod 4 </m> and <m> 8 </m> for <m> p = 2 </m> , so at least at this algebraic level , bott periodicity is present .
given a positive integer <m> n </m> , the hamming distance <m> d ^ H _ n ( x , y ) </m> of <m> x , y \in \{ 0 , 1 \} ^ n </m> is defined by <m> d ^ H _ n ( x , y ) = | \{ k \in \{ 0 , \ldots , n - 1 \} : x ( k ) \neq y ( k ) \} | . </m> given an integer <m> n > 0 </m> and a set <m> S \subseteq \{ 0 , 1 \} ^ n </m> with <m> | S | = n </m> , is it possible to find a map <m> f : S \to \{ 0 , 1 \} ^ { n + 1 } </m> such that <m> d ^ H _ { n + 1 } ( f ( x ) , f ( y ) ) = d ^ H _ n ( x , y ) + 1 \text { f o r a l l } x \neq y \in S </m> ?
let <m> ( M , g ) </m> be a compact riemannian manifold . assume that <m> u _ 0 </m> is a positive smooth function on <m> M </m> and let <m> u _ t = e ^ { t \Delta } u _ 0 </m> be the solution to the heat equation on <m> ( M , g ) </m> with initial data <m> u _ 0 </m> . given <m> 2 a > 1 </m> , is it true that the function <m> f : t \mapsto \int _ M ( u _ t ) ^ { 2 a } </m> is a convex function ? this question gives an answer to functional decaying under the heat flow -LRB- ? -RRB- in the case <m> p = 2 </m> . indeed , <m>  </m> hence , showing that <m> f </m> is convex means that <m> f ' ' \geq 0 </m> or , equivalently , from the previous calculation <m> \frac { d } { d t } \int _ M \left | \nabla ( u _ t ^ a ) \right | ^ 2 d v \leq 0 . </m> the value of <m> a </m> for interest in my problem is <m> 2 a = 2 ^ * + 2 = 4 \frac { n - 1 } { n - 2 } , </m> where <m> n </m> is the dimension of the manifold and <m> 2 ^ * = \frac { 2 n } { n - 2 } </m> .
in definition 4.1.1 of <m> ( \infty , 2 ) </m> - categories and the goodwillie calculus i , lurie defines a weak <m> \infty </m> - bicategory to be a scaled simplicial set that has the extension property with respect to every scaled anodyne morphism . in theorem 4.2.7 , he defines a model structure on <m> \operatorname { S e t } _ { \Delta } ^ { \operatorname { s c } } </m> , the category of scaled simplical sets , and in definition 4.2.8 he defines an <m> \infty </m> - bicategory to be a scaled simplicial set that is a fibrant object in the model category <m> \operatorname { S e t } _ { \Delta } ^ { \operatorname { s c } } </m> . every <m> \infty </m> - bicategory is a weak <m> \infty </m> - bicategory , because every scaled anodyne morphism is a bicategorical equivalence -LRB- proposition 3.1.13 -RRB- . what about the converse ? is every weak <m> \infty </m> - bicategory an <m> \infty </m> - bicategory ? edit : i think i now have a proof that , indeed , every weak <m> \infty </m> - bicategory is an <m> \infty </m> - bicategory . i will post it tomorrow .
given literals <m> x _ 1 , \dots , x _ n </m> how many clauses <m> C _ 1 , \dots , C _ m </m> does one need of the type <m> C _ i = y _ j \vee y _ k \vee y _ l </m> where <m> y _ l \in \{ x _ l , \overline x _ l \} </m> such that the cnf form <m> C _ 1 \wedge \dots \wedge C _ m </m> is satisfied exactly by those <m> 0 / 1 </m> vectors
let <m> G </m> be a finite group , and let <m> g , h \in G </m> be two elements of the same order . does there exist a larger finite group <m> G ' \ge G </m> such that <m> g , h </m> are conjugate in <m> G ' </m> ? if not , what is known about groups which have this property ?
solving <m> x \partial _ x f = 0 </m> over ` normal ' functions is the same as solving <m> \partial _ x f = 0 </m> , i.e. one gets <m> f ( x ) = c _ 1 </m> as the complete answer . but over distributions -LRB- if my calculations are correct -RRB- , <m> f ( x ) = ( c _ 2 - c _ 1 ) H ( x ) + c _ 1 </m> is the complete solution -LRB- with h being the heaviside step function -RRB- . for another comparison point , <m> x ^ 2 \partial _ x f = 0 </m> has solution <m> f ( x ) = ( c _ 2 - c _ 1 ) H ( x ) + c _ 1 + c _ 3 \delta ( x ) </m> -LRB- with <m> \delta </m> the dirac <m> \delta </m> function/distribution -RRB- . my main question : are my computations correct ? are these in fact the most general solutions ? -LSB- i have 3 different arguments showing that these are indeed solutions , although i am not sure that any of these constitute proper proofs , the last time i did anything with distributions was almost 20 years ago -RSB- . motivation : what i am actually trying to do is to get a differential equation for the density function for the pareto distribution -LRB- where ` distribution ' here is used in a different sense -RRB- . the only remaining problem is to properly take care of the ` jump ' at <m> x _ m </m> . the above should give me what i am missing to get there .
let <m> T o p _ 1 </m> be the category of topological spaces which are <m> T _ 1 . </m> i am curious as to whether there is a categorical definition of what a closed embedding is in this environment . with a categorical definition , i mean something along the lines that in the category <m> T o p _ 2 </m> , consisting of topological spaces which are <m> T _ 2 , </m> the closed embeddings are precisely the extremal monomorphisms . in <m> T o p </m> -LRB- and <m> T o p _ 1 </m> -RRB- the extremal monomorphisms are precisely the embeddings . in <m> T o p </m> we can use the sierpinski space to single out the ones with closed image , but this is not possible in <m> T o p _ 1 </m> since the sierpinski object is not <m> T _ 1 . </m> any comments or thoughts would be welcome .
i 'm interested in knowing more about the question if <m> f ( \pi ) </m> is rational or not , where <m> f </m> is some well-known function . for example , <m> \cos ( \pi ) = - 1 </m> is rational , while <m> { e } ^ { \pi } </m> is irrational as shown here by wolframalpha . my question here is : is it possible to know if <m> \log ( \pi ) </m> is rational or not since the <m> \log </m> function is the inverse of the <m> \exp </m> function ? thank you for any help .
i am not a specialist of number theory , so please excuse my ignorance : is the following question still an open problem ? let <m> k \in \mathbb { N } ^ * </m> , are there infinitely many prime numbers of the form <m> n ^ { 2 ^ k } + 1 </m> ?
i had completed a paper describing the <m> q </m> - catalan numbers , which is the <m> q </m> - analog of the catalan numbers . the <m> n </m> - th catalan numbers can be represented by : <m> C _ n = \frac { 1 } { n + 1 } { 2 n \choose n } </m> and with the recurrence relation : <m> C _ { n + 1 } = \sum ^ n _ { i = 0 } C _ i C _ { n - i } \ \ \ \ \ \forall n \geq 0 </m> now , for the <m> q </m> - analog , i know the definition of that can be defined as : <m> \lim _ { q \to 1 } \frac { 1 - q ^ n } { 1 - q } = n </m> and we know that the definition of the <m> q </m> - analog , can be defined like this : <m> [ n ] _ q = \frac { 1 - q ^ n } { 1 - q } = 1 + q + q ^ 2 + q ^ 3 + \cdots + q ^ { n - 1 } </m> which this is the <m> q </m> - analog of <m> n </m> . and that for that <m> q </m> - analog of <m> { 2 n \choose n } </m> : <m> C _ n ( q ) = \frac { 1 } { [ n + 1 ] _ q } \begin {bmatrix} 2 n \\ n \end {bmatrix} _ q </m> so , everything up to this point i know what i 'm doing , and i 'm not sure if i did everything correct after this so , in order to generate the <m> q </m> - catalan numbers , i will need to use the lagrange inversion formula . and , then i got something like this : <m> G ( X ) = \sum ^ \infty _ { i = 0 } C _ i x ^ i </m> where <m> G ( x ) </m> is the generating function , and that <m> G ( x ) = G _ q ( x ) = \sum ^ \infty _ { i = 0 } C _ n ( q ) x ^ n = \sum ^ \infty _ { i = 0 } C _ n x ^ n = 1 + x + x ^ 2 ( 1 + q ) + \cdots </m> since i know that for catalan numbers , it 's true : <m> G ( x ) = ( G ( x ) ) ^ 2 + 1 </m> so , the <m> q </m> - analog will just be : <m> G _ q ( x ) = G ( x ) G _ q ( x ) + 1 </m> so the recurrence relation for the <m> q </m> - analog catalan numbers : <m> C _ { n + 1 } ( q ) = \sum ^ n _ { i = 0 } C _ i C _ { n - 1 } q ^ i </m> it just does n't sound right here ... also , i do n't have a clue that what does the <m> q </m> - catalan numbers count , can anyone help me with that or give me like a clue ? help appreciated !
i apologize for asking questions that seem likely to be answered in conway & sloane 's `` sphere packings , lattices , and groups '' if i knew where to look . let <m> L </m> be the unique * even unimodular lattice of signature <m> ( 1 0 , 2 ) </m> , and let <m> \Delta \subset L </m> be the vectors with norm-square <m> 2 </m> , called the roots .
let <m> \Omega </m> be an open subset of the upper half-plane in the complex plane . i am considering the following problem : -LRB- 1 -RRB- <m> \overline { \partial } u = f , </m> <m> \textrm { I m } f = 0 </m> on the real line for maps complex-valued maps on <m> \Omega . </m> here , <m> \overline { \partial } </m> denotes the classical cauchy-riemann operator . usually one considers -LRB- 1 -RRB- as posed in the space -LRB- of complex-valued maps lying in -RRB- <m> W ^ { 1 , p } </m> for <m> p > 2 </m> because by sobolev embedding elements of <m> W ^ { 1 , p } </m> are actually continuous and the boundary condition is then well-defined . one then has elliptic regularity in the sense that if <m> u \in W ^ { 1 , p } ( \Omega ) </m> solves -LRB- 1 -RRB- for <m> f \in W ^ { k , p } ( \Omega ) , </m> then <m> u \in W ^ { k + 1 , p } _ { l o c } ( \Omega ) </m> with corresponding estimates . -LRB- by usually i mean the references on j-holomorphic cures like salamon-mcduff 's books or the book by abbas-hofer . -RRB- i am actually looking for the corresponding statement for <m> p \in ( 1 , 2 ] . </m> namely consider the space <m> W ^ { 1 , p } ( \Omega ) \times W ^ { 1 , p } _ 0 ( \Omega ) </m> -LRB- now both spaces consist of real-valued maps and correspond to real and imaginary part -RRB- , where <m> W ^ { 1 , p } _ 0 ( \Omega ) </m> is the closure of compactly-supported smooth <m> u \in C ^ { \infty } ( \Omega ) , </m> s.t. <m> \textrm { s u p p } u </m> is disjoint from the real axis . is it then true that a weak solution <m> u \in W ^ { 1 , p } ( \Omega ) \times W ^ { 1 , p } _ 0 ( \Omega ) </m> of <m> \overline { \partial } u = f </m> with <m> f \in W ^ { k , p } </m> is in fact in w ^ -LCB- k +1 , p -RCB- ? as i already mentioned the literature i came across only treats the case <m> p > 2 . </m> notice also that it does not suffice to use regularity theory for the laplace operator , since one only gets local regularity for the real part -LRB- i.e. no regularity up to the boundary -RRB- .

it is known that any closed linear subspace of <m> \mathbb R ^ \omega </m> is topologically isomorphic to <m> \mathbb R ^ n </m> for some <m> n \in \omega </m> . problem 1 . is each closed subgroup of <m> \mathbb Z ^ \omega </m> -LRB- or better <m> \mathbb R ^ \omega </m> -RRB- topologically isomorphic to a tychonoff product of lca -LRB- = locally compact abelian topological -RRB- groups ? if problem 1 has affirmative answer , then we can ask problem 2 . is there a -LRB- desirably simple -RRB- example of a closed subgroup <m> H </m> of a tychonoff product <m> \prod _ { n \in \omega } G _ n </m> of lca groups , which is not topologically isomorphic to a tychonoff product of lca groups ? what will be the answer if <m> H </m> is compactly generated -LRB- i.e. , contains a dense subgroup generated by some compact set -RRB- ?

hirzebruch , in the paper ` arrangements of lines and algebraic surfaces ' constructs a special <m> K 3 </m> surface out of a ` complete quadrilateral ' in <m> C P ^ 2 </m> . a complete quadritlateral consists of 4 points in general position and the <m> 6 </m> lines joining them . over each line hirzebruch forms the local 2:1 fold cover to get a new surface which comes as a branched covering of <m> C P ^ 2 </m> , branched over the <m> 6 </m> lines . away from the lines the covering has degree <m> 2 ^ { 6 - 1 } </m> . this surface has singularities of conical type at the original <m> 4 </m> points -LRB- at these points 3 lines are coincident . -RRB- blow up the singularities coming from these 4 points . . the resulting smooth surface is hirzebruch 's <m> K 3 </m> . viewed from a different perspective , i believe that i can get this same <m> K 3 </m> has an elliptic surface over <m> C P ^ 1 </m> with <m> 6 </m> singular fibers . i also believe that each of the singular fibers are of <m> A _ 1 </m> type , meaning two <m> C P ^ 1 </m> 's intersecting transversally -LRB- as in <m> x y = 0 </m> -RRB- , but am less sure of this . the corresponding singular points on <m> C P ^ 1 </m> can be taken to be the vertices of the octahedron . and i believe that the manifest symmetry group of order <m> 4 ! = 2 4 </m> seen in hirzebruch 's construction -LRB- permute the original 4 points -RRB- agrees with the symmetry group of the octahedron . questions . do you know this second k3 ? if so , could you give me a reference for it ? have you seen a place which shows that the second <m> K 3 </m> is the same as hirzebruch 's ? more generally , what are the first few ` simplest ' elliptic <m> K 3 </m> 's ? by ` elliptic ' i mean expressed as elliptic surface <m> f : X \to C P ^ 1 </m> , over <m> C P ^ 1 </m> . by ` simplest ' i mean a small number of singular fibers whose singularities are as ` simple ' as possible . for example , if all singular fibers are of <m> A _ 1 </m> - type , what is the fewest number of fibers ? must this number be <m> 6 </m> ? -LRB- i have looked in barth-hulek-peters-van de ven 's ` compact complex surfaces ' , esp . ch . v , sec. 2 and suppose this information is buried there somehow or other , but is rather beyond me to untangle it from there . neither did i find this 2nd <m> K 3 </m> in gompf and stipsicz 's book -RRB-

the integral converges as it is easily seen to be upper bounded by <m> \sqrt { \pi / 2 } </m> . however , laplace 's method does not seem to work out as the maxima of the function <m> S ( x ) = - a \sqrt { 1 - e ^ { - x } } - x ^ 2 / 2 </m> is located at the end point <m> 0 </m> . this question enquires about a similar problem , however , with the major difference that the <m> S ( x ) </m> function there is given by <m> - a ( 1 - e ^ { - x } ) - x ^ 2 / 2 </m> . the second answer to that problem suggests using a modified form of laplace 's method as given by v. zorich , mathematical analysis ii chap . xix , par . 2.4 , theorem 1 , to tackle the issue of maxima at an endpoint . however , for the problem at hand , this method breaks down as the function <m> S ( x ) </m> is not differentiable at <m> 0 </m> . so , laplace 's method can not be applied here . i tried using the transformation <m> 1 - e ^ { - x } \to x ^ 2 </m> to obtain the integral <m> \int _ 0 ^ 1 \frac { \exp ( - a x - ( \ln ( 1 - x ^ 2 ) ) ^ 2 / 2 ) } { 1 - x ^ 2 } 2 x d x </m> from this , intuitively , it seems to me that , at least for large <m> a </m> , the integrand is concentrated highly around <m> 0 </m> , and there it seems to be approximated `` well '' by <m> 2 x e ^ { - a x } </m> , which produces a <m> \sim \frac { 1 } { a ^ 2 } </m> trend . however , all this is very intuitive and i do n't know how to transform this intuition into rigorous statements . also , this intuition seems to serve well for getting asymptotics , but my true intention is to obtain tight upper bounds . as laplace 's method seems not to be a suitable choice , i do not have much idea about how to proceed to say anything about an upper bound . please help .

i have a rather elementary question . i would like to know what are the surfaces of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 3 </m> which are globally preserved by the action of a linear or affine map in a non trivial way . this question is voluntarily vague . obvious example of such surfaces are linear planes and the level sets of quadratic form . so my questions unfold the following way :
i 'm reading deitmar 's paper on schemes over <m> \mathbb { F } _ 1 </m> . proposition 2.4 . states that for a scheme <m> X </m> over <m> \mathbb { F } _ 1 </m> there is a bijection between <m> X ( \mathbb { F } _ 1 ) </m> and the set of connected components of <m> X </m> . i do n't understand the proof , which is quite sketchy . here is what i think : elements of <m> X ( \mathbb { F } _ 1 ) </m> correspond to morphisms <m> \mathrm { S p e c } ( \mathbb { F } _ 1 ) \to X </m> , where <m> \mathrm { S p e c } ( F _ 1 ) </m> is the point together with the trivial monoid sheaf <m> 1 </m> . these morphisms correspond to a point <m> x \in X </m> together with a local homomorphism <m> \mathcal { O } _ { X , x } \to \{ 1 \} </m> . but this is unique and exists iff <m> \mathcal { O } _ { X , x } = \mathcal { O } _ { X , x } ^ * </m> , i.e. iff the stalk is actually a group . now to such a point we should associate to irreducible closed subset <m> \overline { \{ x \} } \subseteq X </m> . but why should it be a connected component , and why does every one arise this way ? i can show that every irreducible scheme over <m> \mathbb { F } _ 1 </m> has exactly one generic point . so perhaps proposition 2.4 should talk about irreducible components ? i 'm a bit confused . also deitmar 's proof suggests implicitly that every <m> X </m> is the disjoint union of its connected components , i.e. that they are open - but why should this be true ? for ordinary schemes this is true at least in the noetherian case .

what kind of approaches can be used to study the following quasilinear parabolic pde for a scalar function <m> u = u ( x , t ) </m> ? <m> u _ t = u \ u _ { x x } </m> the physical problem where this pde comes from dictates that the cauchy problem of interest corresponds to an initial condition which is a third-order polynomial with no-constant term <m> u ( x , 0 ) = x \ ( x ^ 2 - s x + p ) , \ \ \ x \in \mathbb { R } ^ + , \ \ \ s p \neq 0 </m> note that <m> u ( x , 0 ) </m> is initially <m> \propto x </m> , and that <m> u ( x , t ) </m> will remain so during the evolution as long as the pde makes sense . indeed , and this is the crux of the matter , numerical experiments and heuristic arguments strongly indicate that there exists a blow-up time <m> 0 < T = T ( s , p ) < \infty </m> , where the solution explodes to infinity , with <m> u ( x , t ) \sim \frac { f ( x ) } { T - t } , \ \ \ t \to T ^ - </m>
i am wondering if i could deduce the bound for the partial sums \ -LSB- \ sum _ -LCB- n \ leq x -RCB- a -LRB- n -RRB- \ ll x ^ -LCB- a -RCB- , \ quad x \ to \ infty \ -RSB- from the relation \ -LSB- \ sum _ -LCB- n \ geq 1 -RCB- a -LRB- n -RRB- e ^ -LCB- - ny -RCB- \ ll y ^ -LCB- - a -RCB- , \ quad y \ to 0 ^ -LCB- + -RCB- . \ -RSB- the condition on <m> a ( n ) </m> is <m> | a ( n ) | = 1 </m> for all <m> n \geq 1 </m> . if anything has been already established on this , it could save my time tremendously -LRB- and much more , might make me happy -RRB- . you could use the fact that the function \ -LSB- \ sum _ -LCB- n \ geq 1 -RCB- \ frac -LCB- a -LRB- n -RRB- -RCB- -LCB- n ^ -LCB- s -RCB- -RCB- \ -RSB- is analytic for <m> \sigma > A </m> . it is a routine that via mellin inversion theorem , \ -LSB- \ sum _ -LCB- n \ geq 1 -RCB- a -LRB- n -RRB- e ^ -LCB- - ny -RCB- = \ frac -LCB- 1 -RCB- -LCB- 2 \ pi i -RCB- \ int _ -LCB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RCB- \ gamma -LRB- s -RRB- f -LRB- s -RRB- y ^ -LCB- - s -RCB- ds . \ -RSB- my first question should be , is it ever possible ?
question : for <m> k > 3 </m> does there exist an odd prime <m> q _ k </m> such that <m> p _ k = 2 ^ k q _ k + 1 </m> is prime and <m> p _ k </m> divides <m> a _ k = \dfrac { 3 ^ { 2 ^ { k - 1 } } + 1 } { 2 } </m> ? \ if <m> k = 3 </m> the answer is yes because for <m> q _ 3 = 5 </m> we get <m> p _ 3 = a _ 3 = 4 1 </m> . \ <m> a _ 4 = 3 2 8 1 = 1 7 \cdot 1 9 3 </m> but neither <m> 1 7 = 2 ^ 4 \cdot 1 + 1 </m> nor <m> 1 9 3 = 2 ^ 4 \cdot 1 2 + 1 </m> qualifies to be <m> p _ 4 </m> because <m> 1 </m> and <m> 1 2 </m> are not -LRB- odd -RRB- prime numbers . \ <m> a _ 5 , a _ 6 </m> and <m> a _ 7 </m> turn out to be prime numbers , so , the answer to the question is no -LRB- see the recursive definition below -RRB- . <m> a _ 8 </m> has <m> 6 1 </m> digits and none of its factors qualifies to be <m> p _ 8 </m> . unfortunately <m> a _ 9 </m> has approximately <m> 1 2 1 </m> digits and <m> a _ { 1 0 } </m> has approximately 243 digits . i would like to see a proof for the no answer for <m> k > 3 </m> or see the condition on <m> k </m> for which the answer is yes . \ there is also a recursive definition for <m> a _ k </m> : <m> a _ 2 = 5 , a _ k = 2 ^ k ( a _ 2 \cdots a _ { k - 1 } ) + 1 , k > 2 , </m> which makes it very clear why <m> k = 3 </m> is a yes answer . -LRB- <m> a _ 1 </m> does n't really matter but a meaningful definition for it is <m> a _ 1 = 2 . </m> -RRB-
in physics papers , the massless free boson has a definition involving an action : <m> S ( X ) = \frac { 1 } { 8 \pi } \int d \sigma ^ 2 \, \partial X \overline { \partial X } </m> the random functions <m> X ( z ) </m> are sampled according to the gaussian distribution : <m> e ^ { - S ( X ) } </m> . in this case we can define the correlator to be the vacuum expectation value : <m> \mathbb { E } [ X ( z , \overline { z } ) X ( w , \overline { w } ) ] \equiv \langle \varnothing | X ( z , \overline { z } ) X ( w , \overline { w } ) | \varnothing \rangle = - \tfrac { 1 } { 2 } \ln | z - w | </m> see ginsparg , applied conformal field theory . i am trying to fill in the details of this derivation ... using probability theory , complex analysis or anything else .
let <m> D F </m> denote the category whose objects are categories and whose morphisms <m> F \colon R \to S </m> are the discrete fibrations . this category has applications to the real-world problem of structuring data . you can think of any discrete fibration <m> R \to S </m> as providing a schematic structure <m> S </m> for more raw data <m> R </m> . this question is about finding a best such structure for given data . for any category <m> R </m> , one can define the coslice category <m> D F _ { R / } </m> of discrete fibrations out of <m> R </m> . given a discrete fibration <m> R \to S </m> , call <m> S </m> the base space . i want to find a minimal base space <m> R ^ { m i n } </m> for a given <m> R </m> . to get at that idea , i 'll ask for some kind of universal object . i once asked on the categories mailing list whether <m> D F _ { R / } </m> has a terminal object in general . as was explained to me by mark weber and thorston palm , it does not . basically , if <m> R = \emptyset </m> then we 're asking for a terminal object in <m> D F </m> , and by cardinality arguments , this does not exist . but in fact i was asking the wrong question . if i want minimal models , i actually want my discrete fibrations to be surjective . the counter-examples provided to me by weber and palm fail to cause a problem in that context . so here 's the question . question : define <m> D F S </m> to be the subcategory of <m> D F </m> in which the morphisms are discrete fibrations <m> F \colon R \to S </m> , required to be surjective on objects . then does <m> D F S _ { R / } </m> have a terminal object <m> R ^ { m i n } </m> for a given category <m> R </m> ?
given positive integers <m> m </m> , <m> r </m> and <m> n </m> , let <m> \pi ( m , r , n ) </m> denote the number of prime numbers <m> p \leq n </m> in the residue class <m> r </m> -LRB- mod <m> m </m> -RRB- . further let <m> 1 = r _ 1 < r _ 2 < \dots < r _ { \varphi ( m ) } = m - 1 </m> be the prime residues -LRB- mod <m> m </m> -RRB- , and let <m> \sigma \in { \rm S y m } ( \{ r _ 1 , \dots , r _ { \varphi ( m ) } \} ) </m> be a permutation of them . are there always infinitely many <m> n \in \mathbb { N } </m> such that <m> \pi ( m , \sigma ( r _ 1 ) , n ) < \pi ( m , \sigma ( r _ 2 ) , n ) < \dots < \pi ( m , \sigma ( r _ { \varphi ( m ) } ) , n ) </m> ? if the answer is yes , are explicit bounds <m> B ( m ) </m> known such that for every permutation <m> \sigma </m> of the prime residues -LRB- mod <m> m </m> -RRB- there is at least one such <m> n </m> less than <m> B ( m ) </m> ? if the answer is no , for which permutations <m> \sigma </m> are there infinitely many such <m> n </m> , and for which are not ?
for <m> p \in ( 0 , 1 ) </m> and <m> \epsilon > 0 </m> a small enough constant , consider the function <m> f : \mathbb { N } \to \mathbb { R } </m> given by <m> f ( y ) = \int _ 0 ^ \epsilon \frac { \left ( \frac { p - t } { p ( 1 - t ) } \right ) ^ y - ( 1 - t ) ^ { y ( 1 - p ) / p } } { t \log ( 1 - t ) } d t . </m> is it true that <m> f ( y ) = O ( 1 ) </m> for all <m> p \in ( 0 , 1 ) </m> ? numerical experiments seem to support this assertion . a possible first approach would be to compute the taylor expansion of the numerator around <m> t = 0 </m> . we have <m> \left ( \frac { p - t } { p ( 1 - t ) } \right ) ^ y - ( 1 - t ) ^ { y ( 1 - p ) / p } = O _ y ( t ^ 2 ) , </m> where <m> O _ y </m> hides terms which depend on <m> y </m> . if these terms were independent of <m> y </m> then the result would follow easily , but this is not the case .
the question that i have in mind is the following : which kind of closed sets can arise as the <m> \omega </m> - limit of a point for a <m> 1 </m> - dimensional dynamical system ? it is probably somewhat naive , but nowhere i looked did i find a hint of what kind of answer i was to expect . let me specify a bit what got me to formulate my question this way . some of the simplest examples of such systems are rotations of the circle . for those , the <m> \omega </m> - limits are either a finite orbit or the whole circle and are from the topological point of view very simple . the denjoy construction takes it to another level , it builds an homeomorphism of the circle for which the orbit of any point accumulates to a cantor set . the price to pay though is that such a construction can not be made <m> \mathcal { C } ^ 2 </m> .
let <m> ( X , \omega ) </m> be a smooth kähler manifold -LRB- not necessarily compact -RRB- with an isometric <m> S ^ 1 </m> - action with a hamiltonian <m> H </m> . it is a well known fact that 1 -RRB- the reduced spaces <m> X ( c ) = H ^ { - 1 } ( c ) / S ^ 1 </m> have a complex analytic structure . 2 -RRB- such spaces are bimeromorphic for <m> c </m> satisfying <m> \min ( H ) < c < \max ( H ) </m> . i was not able to find a reference for these facts and would be very grateful if you can give me one . ps . in fact i 'll be happy with a user-friendly reference for the case when <m> X </m> is a smooth projective complex manifold .
let <m> ( M , g ) </m> be a riemannian manifold which admit a non vanishing vector field . -LRB- that is <m> \chi ( M ) = 0 </m> when <m> M </m> is a compact manifold -RRB- . we pull back the symplectic structure of the cotangent bundle to the <m> 2 </m> - form <m> \omega </m> on <m> T M </m> .
for a given <m> n </m> , i am trying to find a constant value <m> c </m> such that you can always find a prime <m> p </m> of the form <m> 4 x + 1 </m> for some <m> x \in \mathbb { Z } _ + </m> and <m> n < p < c n </m> . i want to find the smallest such <m> c </m> for which the above property holds for all values of <m> n </m> . i searched in literature , i could only find that <m> ( n ! ) ^ 2 + 1 </m> has a prime divisor <m> p </m> of the form <m> 4 x + 1 </m> and <m> n < p < ( n ! ) ^ 2 + 1 </m> . but <m> n ! </m> upper bound is huge for my need . also i found that we can find a prime <m> p </m> of the form <m> 4 x + 1 </m> such that <m> n < p < ( p _ 1 . . . p _ k ) ^ 2 + 1 </m> where <m> p _ 1 , . . . , p _ k </m> are all the prime numbers of the form <m> 4 x + 1 </m> and less than <m> n </m> . this upper bound of <m> ( p _ 1 . . . p _ k ) ^ 2 + 1 </m> is also large for my need . also i found some asymptotic formulas but i want formulas which holds for all numbers . it would be great if i can find a constant <m> c </m> such that there is always a prime of the form <m> 4 x + 1 </m> between <m> n </m> and <m> c n </m> and the property holds for all <m> n </m> . thanks in advance .
let <m> \kappa </m> be an infinite cardinal . consider the following example to <m> 2 ^ \kappa \nrightarrow ( 3 ) ^ 2 _ \kappa </m> . <m> V </m> is a set of vertices , each of which is an element of <m> 2 ^ \kappa </m> . color the edge between two vertices <m> f , g \in 2 ^ \kappa </m> by the least ordinal on which <m> f , g </m> disagree . it follows that there is no homogeneous set of size <m> 3 </m> , i.e. there is no triangle with all three edges the same color . more is true : there is no closed walk of length 3,5,7 , ... which is monochromatic , i.e. all edges are the same color . definition : a closed walk consists of a sequence of vertices starting and ending at the same vertex . question : can you find an example to <m> 2 ^ \kappa \nrightarrow ( 3 ) ^ 2 _ \kappa </m> , therefore no monochromatic triangles are allowed , but which has closed walks of length <m> n </m> , for any odd number <m> n > 3 </m> ?
let <m> W </m> be a separable banach space and <m> \mu </m> a gaussian borel measure on <m> W </m> which is centered and non-degenerate . for <m> F : W \to \mathbb { R } </m> bounded borel and <m> t \ge 0 </m> , let <m> P _ t F ( x ) = \int _ W F ( x + \sqrt { t } y ) \, \mu ( d y ) </m> be the transition semigroup of brownian motion on <m> W </m> .
let <m> S </m> be the set of positive integers of the form <m> 2 ^ a 3 ^ b 5 ^ c 7 ^ d </m> . i need information about the cardinality of the intersection of <m> S </m> and its translates . in particular , is <m> S \cap ( S + t ) </m> infinite for every integer <m> t </m> ? for some values of <m> t </m> ? photo of the some of the solutions for <m> t = 1 </m> . only integer solutions count , however . this still lacks proof it has infinitely many solutions over the set of integers . the graph looks similar for the solutions to 10 , 100 , and pretty much any number , which leads me to believe there are infinite solutions . a proof for this , though , would be invaluable . another way this can be worded is if the equation <m> 2 ^ A 3 ^ B 5 ^ C 7 ^ D - 2 ^ a 3 ^ b 5 ^ c 7 ^ d = 1 \{ A , B , C , D , a , b , c , d \in \mathbb { Z } \} </m> has an upper bound . this would determine if it has infinite solutions , and may be able to be generalized for all of <m> n > 0 </m> instead of 1 . this function has way too many variables to be graphed so an algebraic way to determine if a function has bounds would be best .
let <m> a \in \mathbb { C } ^ { \times } </m> , <m> r \in N </m> . let <m> W = V _ q ( r ) </m> be the <m> r </m> - dimensional irreducible type 1 representation of <m> U _ q ( g l _ 2 ( \mathbb { C } ) ) </m> . in the usual basis <m> \{ v _ 0 , \ldots , v _ r \} </m> , the action of <m> U _ q ( g l _ 2 ( \mathbb { C } ) ) </m> on <m> V _ q ( r ) </m> is given by <m>  </m> the evaluation module <m> V _ q ( r ) _ a </m> is the pull-back of the module <m> V _ q ( r ) </m> via the evaluation map <m> e v _ a : U _ q ( L ( s l _ 2 ) ) \to U _ q ( g l _ 2 ) </m> . on page 401 , example 12.2.11 , of the book a guide to quantum groups , it is said that the drinfeld polynomial associated to the evaluation module <m> V _ q ( r ) _ a </m> is <m> P _ 1 ( u ) = \prod _ { p = 1 } ^ r ( u - a ^ { - 1 } q ^ { 2 p - r - 1 } ) . </m> how to compute this polynomial ? thank you very much .

in relation to the question on the hardy inequality and the answer by terry tao , i 've always been curious about the following : let <m> U \subset \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> be a bounded domain of class <m> C ^ 2 </m> , <m> ( e ^ { - t A } ) _ { t \ge 0 } </m> be the dirichlet heat semigroup -LRB- s -RRB- on <m> L ^ p ( U ) </m> , <m> 1 \le p \le \infty </m> . <m> A </m> is the dirichlet laplacian -LRB- i.e. zero boundary conditions -RRB- . compare the following -LRB- where <m> \lesssim </m> hides a constant dependent on <m> p , q , U </m> -RRB- :
i am interested in a <m> 2 3 </m> - dimensional <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> - vector space <m> V </m> which i am viewing as a gl <m> _ { 2 3 } ( \mathbb { Q } ) </m> representation . schur functors can be defined over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> , so we get representations <m> \Gamma _ \lambda = \mathbb { S } _ \lambda V </m> corresponding to partitions <m> \lambda </m> -LRB- following the notation in fulton and harris representation theory : a first course -RRB- . there is also a quadratic form <m> q </m> on <m> V </m> defined over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> , and so we similarly get representations <m> \Gamma _ \lambda </m> of o <m> ( q ) </m> . if i was working over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> instead of <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> , fulton and harris equation 25.37 gives a formula for restricting these gl <m> _ { 2 3 } ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> - representations <m> \Gamma _ \lambda </m> to o <m> _ { 2 3 } ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> : <m> \mathrm { R e s } ^ { G L _ { 2 3 } ( \mathbb { C } ) } _ { O _ { 2 3 } ( \mathbb { C } ) } ( \Gamma _ \lambda ) = \bigoplus N _ { \lambda \bar { \lambda } } \Gamma _ { \bar { \lambda } } , </m> where <m> N _ { \lambda \bar { \lambda } } = \sum _ { \delta } N _ { \delta \bar { \lambda } \lambda } </m> , a sum of littlewood-richardson coefficients . i am wondering , does this same formula hold when everything is defined over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> , as above ? any references for this would be extremely helpful .
let <m> S </m> be a smooth complex projective surface which is a complete intersection and such that <m> K _ S = \mathcal { O } _ S ( k ) </m> , <m> k > 0 </m> . let <m> C </m> be a smooth curve on <m> S </m> such that <m> C ^ 2 > 0 </m> . i 'm interested in a lower bound for <m> C \cdot K _ S </m> in terms of <m> K ^ 2 _ S </m> . this is obvious if <m> \mathcal { O } _ S ( C ) = \mathcal { O } _ S ( h ) </m> for some <m> h > 0 </m> , that is , if <m> C </m> is a complete intersection . nevertheless it seems reasonable to me that also for curves which are not complete intersections <m> C \cdot K _ S </m> is big when <m> K ^ 2 _ S </m> is . thank you
let <m> ( X , \tau ) </m> be a hausdorff space . let <m> [ X ] ^ 2 = \big \{ \{ x , y \} : x , y \in X \land x \neq y \big \} </m> . for <m> U , V \in \tau </m> with <m> U \cap V = \emptyset </m> we set <m> [ U , V ] = \big \{ \{ x , y \} \in [ X ] ^ 2 : x \in U \land y \in V \big \} </m> . we endow <m> [ X ] ^ 2 </m> with the topology <m> [ \tau ] ^ 2 </m> , which is generated by <m> \{ [ U , V ] : U , V \in \tau \land U \cap V = \emptyset \} </m> . if <m> X </m> is compact , is <m> [ X ] ^ 2 </m> compact , too ?
we know that principal congruence subgroups are characteristic in <m> S L ( n , \mathbb Z ) </m> . suppose <m> \Gamma </m> is a finite index subgroup of <m> S L ( n , \mathbb Z ) </m> and <m> \Gamma _ m </m> is a principal congruence subgroup of level m contained in <m> \Gamma </m> . will it be characteristic in <m> \Gamma </m> ?
given a function -LRB- aka ` permutation ' -RRB- <m> f : A \rightarrow A </m> , where <m> A </m> is a finite set such that <m> | A | = N </m> , we call it a self-inverse if <m> f ( f ( x ) ) = x </m> . the sequence of how many such functions exist for increasing cardinalities is given by oeis a000085 . as far as i can tell , there is only a recursive formula for this sequence , is there a general formula ?

let <m> M </m> be a riemannian manifold and let <m> n </m> a positive integer . denote by <m> F _ n ( M ) \subset M ^ n </m> the space of all <m> n </m> - tuples of pairwise distinct points from <m> M </m> . the isometries of <m> M </m> act co-ordinate wise on <m> M ^ n </m> , and this action restricts to an action on <m> F _ n ( M ) </m> . what is known about the quotient of <m> F _ n ( M ) </m> by this action ? i am particularly interested in the case where <m> M </m> is the hyperbolic plane and <m> n > 3 </m> , but any starting points or references would be a great help .
let <m> K ( G , n ) </m> be the eilenberg maclane space . consider the map from <m> K ( \mathbb { Z } _ 2 , 1 ) \to K ( \mathbb { Z } _ 4 , 1 ) \overset { f } { \to } K ( \mathbb { Z } _ 2 , 1 ) \overset { g } { \to } K ( \mathbb { Z } _ 2 , 2 ) \to \dots , </m> it looks that we can represent the map from <m> K ( \mathbb { Z } _ 2 , 1 ) \to K ( \mathbb { Z } _ 2 , 2 ) </m> relating to the generator of cohomology group <m> q \in H ^ 2 ( K ( \mathbb { Z } _ 2 , 1 ) , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) = H ^ 2 ( B \mathbb { Z } _ 2 , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) = \mathbb { Z } _ 2 . </m> say <m> p \in H ^ 1 ( K ( \mathbb { Z } _ 2 , 1 ) , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) = H ^ 1 ( B \mathbb { Z } _ 2 , \mathbb { Z } _ 2 ) = \mathbb { Z } _ 2 , </m> then <m> q </m> and <m> p </m> are group cocycles related by <m> q = p \cup p . </m>
let <m> M </m> be a smooth paracompact manifold . i think that the ring <m> C ^ { \infty } ( M ) </m> contains many -LRB- possibly almost all ? -RRB- geometric or topological information about <m> M </m> . -LRB- e.g. let <m> E </m> be a vector bundle over <m> M </m> , <m> \Gamma ( E ) </m> be a set of smooth section of <m> E </m> . then , <m> \Gamma ( E ) </m> is a <m> C ^ \infty ( M ) </m> - module . -LRB- actually , i think <m> \Gamma ( E ) </m> is projective <m> C ^ \infty ( M ) </m> - module because every a short exact sequence of vector bundle splits . -RRB- -RRB- but i have a feeling that <m> C ^ \infty ( M ) </m> is too large to change the problem of manifold theory into an algebraic problem or ring theoretic problem . are there any well-known concrete description about the ring <m> C ^ \infty ( M ) </m> for some manifold <m> M </m> with simple topology ?
in defining <m> \overline { M _ { g , n } } </m> , we say that an <m> S </m> - point of it is a nodal curve <m> X \to S </m> , and <m> n </m> sections <m> s _ i : S \to X </m> , <m> i = 1 , \cdots , n </m> and plus stability conditions . implicitly , we are ordering these sections . what if we do n't order them and take the following as definition . an <m> S </m> - point is a nodal curve <m> X \to S </m> together with an effective relative cartier divisor <m> D </m> on <m> X </m> of degree <m> n </m> , plus the same stability condition on each geometric fiber . what kind of moduli space shall we get with this definition ? is it just the usual <m> \overline { M _ { g , n } } </m> quotient by the order <m> n </m> symmetric groups ?
a too-vaguely worded question posted today about suzuki and ree groups reminds me to revisit a concern i never followed up years ago when assembling information about modular representations of finite groups of lie type in the defining characteristic . one extreme case , for which basic data still seems incomplete , is the ree group of type <m> \mathrm { F } _ 4 </m> in characteristic <m> p = 2 </m> . here the extra-twisted finite simple groups live only over finite fields of order an odd power of <m> p </m> starting with <m> 2 ^ 3 </m> . often the group is denoted <m> ^ 2 \! \mathrm { F } _ 4 ( q ^ 2 ) </m> with <m> q ^ 2 = 2 ^ { 2 r + 1 } </m> with <m> r \geq 1 </m> , to make formulas for order and the like resemble those for the usual type <m> \mathrm { F } _ 4 </m> chevalley groups . while the older computer work by gilkey-seitz gives good results on simple modules for <m> \mathrm { F } _ 4 </m> for some small primes and small highest weights , it seems to leave some guesswork about the 16 restricted representations for <m> p = 2 </m> . these in turn feed into the somewhat more complicated recipe found by steinberg for the ree groups . beyond this there are the -LRB- indecomposable -RRB- projective covers of those simples , along with their relationship to ordinary characters -LRB- which are known in principle from the deligne-lusztig viewpoint -RRB- .
let <m> F </m> be a domain and let <m> R \le F </m> be a subring such that <m> F </m> is a free <m> R </m> - module of finite rank <m> n </m> . question : is there an <m> R </m> - basis <m> \lbrace e _ 1 , . . . , e _ n \rbrace </m> of <m> F </m> such that at least one of the basis elements is a unit in <m> F </m> ? as an example consider <m> R = \mathbb { Z } </m> and <m> F = \mathbb { Z } [ \text { i } ] </m> where we can take the units <m> 1 , \text { i } </m> as basis .
let <m> L ^ + </m> be a set of all real valued functions defined on a real line which are lebesgue integrable on each <m> [ 0 , c ] </m> , where <m> c > 0 </m> , and are zero for <m> x < 0 </m> . let for <m> a > 0 </m> , <m> f _ a ( t ) = ( t - a ) ^ { - 3 / 4 } </m> for <m> t > a </m> and <m> 0 </m> for <m> t \leq a </m> . then , for <m> a , b > 0 </m> , convolution <m> ( f _ a * f _ b ) ( x ) : = \int _ 0 ^ x f _ a ( x - y ) f _ b ( y ) d y = \beta ( x - a - b ) ^ { - \frac { 1 } { 2 } } </m> for <m> x > a + b </m> and <m> 0 </m> for <m> x \leq a + b </m> , where <m> \beta = B ( \frac { 1 } { 4 } , \frac { 1 } { 4 } ) </m> . it shows that convolution of two functions from <m> L ^ + </m> need not be continuous . is it possible , maybe by condensation of singularities and above example to show existence of two functions from <m> L ^ + </m> which convolution is discontinuous everywhere on <m> [ 0 , \infty ) </m> ?
given a set of <m> n </m> vertices and the fact that none of them is of degree greater than <m> 2 </m> , how many distinct such graphs are there ?
consider the classical schwartz space <m> \mathcal { S } ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> together with the fourier transform <m> \mathcal { F } : \mathcal { S } ( \mathbb { R } ) \rightarrow \mathcal { S } ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> . consider the subspace <m> V </m> of the even , smooth functions on the interval <m> [ - 1 , 1 ] </m> . can you construct a -LRB- bounded -RRB- operator <m> D : \mathcal { S } ( \mathbb { R } ) \rightarrow \mathcal { S } ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> such that <m> D \mathcal { F } v = 0 , \quad D v = v \qquad \forall v \in V ? </m> observe that by paley-wiener , the intersection <m> \mathcal { F } V \cap V = 0 </m> is trivial . what is the associated schwartz kernel ?
let <m> G = ( V , E ) </m> be a simple , undirected graph . suppose that <m> { \cal S } </m> is a collection of non-empty , connected , and pairwise disjoint subsets of <m> V </m> . let <m> G ( { \cal S } ) </m> be the graph with vertex set <m> { \cal S } </m> ; and <m> S \neq T \in { \cal S } </m> form an edge if and only if if there are <m> x \in S , y \in T </m> such that <m> \{ x , y \} \in E </m> . if <m> H </m> is a simple undirected graph , we say that <m> H </m> is a induced minor of <m> G </m> if there is a collection <m> { \cal S } </m> of non-empty , connected , and pairwise disjoint subsets of <m> V ( G ) </m> such that <m> H \cong G ( { \cal S } ) </m> . we make <m> \omega ^ 2 </m> into a graph by saying that <m> ( x _ 0 , y _ 0 ) , ( x _ 1 , y _ 1 ) \in \omega ^ 2 </m> form an edge if and only if <m> | x _ 0 - x _ 1 | + | y _ 0 - y _ 1 | = 1 </m> -LRB- that is any point and its direct successor in the product order of <m> \omega ^ 2 </m> form an edge -RRB- . is every finite graph an induced minor of <m> \omega ^ 2 </m> ?
it is related to this question . question . suppose that <m> p </m> is a prime , <m> p - 1 </m> is divisible by <m> q ^ 2 </m> for some <m> q </m> . is it true that every number modulo <m> p </m> is a sum of two <m> q </m> - th powers . if <m> q = 2 </m> , then -LRB- * -RRB- is true . indeed in that case <m> p \equiv 1 \mod 4 </m> . take any number <m> t \mod p </m> . wlog we can assume that <m> t </m> is odd -LRB- the product of two sums of two squares is a sum of two squares -RRB- . if <m> t \equiv 1 \mod 4 </m> , then consider the arithmetic progression <m> 4 n p + t , n \ge 0 </m> . by dirichlet , it contains a prime <m> p ' \equiv 1 \mod 4 </m> . by fermat , <m> p ' </m> is a sum of two squares , hence <m> t </m> is a sum of two squares modulo <m> p </m> . if <m> p \equiv - 1 \mod 4 </m> , then consider the arithmetic progression <m> 8 n p + t - 2 p , n \ge 0 </m> . by dirichlet , it contains a prime number <m> p ' </m> of the form <m> 4 k + 1 </m> -LRB- since <m> p \equiv 1 \mod 4 </m> -RRB- and we are done . that question may be easier than the question cited above . or it may be a known open problem . update several simplifications of the argument for <m> q = 2 </m> were proposed . although the statement is not true when <m> ( p - 1 ) / q ^ 2 </m> is small , it is true when this quotient is large enough . i think this answers my question almost completely . thanks to everybody who gave an answer or a comment .
let <m> P </m> be a convex polytope in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ d </m> with <m> n </m> vertices and <m> f </m> facets . let <m> \text { P r o j } ( P ) </m> denote the projection of <m> P </m> into <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> . can <m> \text { P r o j } ( P ) </m> have more than <m> f </m> facets ? in the general case , each successive projection can increase the number of facets from <m> f </m> to <m> \left \lfloor \frac { f ^ 2 } { 2 } \right \rfloor </m> , but i 'm wondering if <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> is a special case .
we know <m> N P \neq P </m> from a lot of point of view like empirical reason , or theoretical reasons such as finite model theory or descriptive complexity.although we find so many reasons to believe <m> N P \neq P </m> , we have not found any proof for it now . so any reason to believe that <m> N P \neq P </m> is unprovable in zfc?any result about unprovability of <m> N P \neq P </m> in zfc or weaker system than zfc .
does exist a smooth , complex , projective variety <m> X </m> of dimension <m> d \geq 2 </m> such that <m> X </m> does not contain smooth , complex , projective curves of wichever genus <m> g \geq 2 </m> ? answer by bertie : no , it does not exists . more in general , does previous statement hold for <m> X </m> over any field of characteristic <m> 0 </m> ? partial answer : if the field is algebraically closed : no , it does not . open question : does exist a smooth projective variety <m> X </m> of dimension <m> d \geq 2 </m> over a field <m> \mathbb { K } </m> not algebraically closed of characteristic <m> 0 </m> , such that <m> X </m> does not contain smooth projective curves of wichever genus <m> g \geq 2 </m> ?
i have a somewhat vague question : does there exist a prime <m> p </m> and a triangulated category killed by the multiplication by <m> p </m> that would be `` interesting for topologists '' ? this category would probably correspond to the study of <m> p </m> - torsion of -LRB- co -RRB- homology . as far as i remember , <m> S ^ 0 / p </m> is not a ring spectrum by a result of schwede -LRB- so , one can not consider modules over it -RRB- ; yet does there exist any method for `` overcoming '' this difficulty -LRB- and still obtaining a `` non-algebraic '' triangulated category -RRB- somehow ? here non-algebraic means that the category should not be `` closely related '' to the derived category of any abelian category . i suspect that there should exist certain categories of this sort since certain cohomology theories -LRB- including <m> K </m> - theory -RRB- can not be defined in terms of complexes .
the figiel-johnson tsirelson space is an example of an asymptotic <m> \ell _ 1 </m> banach space not containing <m> \ell _ 1 </m> . the notion of asymptotic <m> \ell _ 1 </m> is with respect to some basis , but a coordinate free notion exists -LRB- sometimes referred to asymptotic <m> \ell _ 1 </m> in the literature , although i am not sure whether this terminology is widespread -RRB- . this can be defined via weakly null trees of height <m> n </m> , or in terms of a two player game . for fixed <m> n </m> and <m> K > 0 </m> , player i chooses a weak neighborhood <m> U _ 1 </m> of <m> 0 </m> , player ii chooses <m> x _ 1 \in S _ X \cap U _ 1 </m> , etc. , until <m> U _ 1 , \ldots , U _ n </m> and <m> x _ 1 , \ldots , x _ n \in S _ X </m> are chosen . player i wins if <m> ( x _ i ) _ { i = 1 } ^ \infty </m> is <m> K </m> - equivalent to the <m> \ell _ 1 ^ n </m> basis . then we say <m> X </m> is asymptotic <m> \ell _ 1 </m> if there exists <m> K > 1 </m> such that for every <m> n \in \mathbb { N } </m> , player i has a winning strategy in the game with this <m> n </m> and <m> K </m> . what i am looking for is : for every limit ordinal <m> \xi </m> , if <m> c _ { 0 0 } ( \xi ) </m> denotes the span of the hamel basis <m> ( e _ \gamma : \gamma < \xi ) </m> , can we define a norm <m> | \cdot | </m> on <m> c _ { 0 0 } ( \xi ) </m> to have the following properties ? <m> ( 1 ) </m> <m> ( e _ \gamma : \gamma < \xi ) </m> is normalized and <m> 1 </m> - unconditional . <m> ( 2 ) </m> the completion <m> X </m> of <m> c _ { 0 0 } ( \xi ) </m> with respect to <m> | \cdot | </m> is asymptotic <m> \ell _ 1 </m> . <m> ( 3 ) </m> there does not exist a countably infinite subset <m> G </m> of <m> \xi </m> such that <m> ( e _ \gamma ) _ { \gamma \in G } </m> is equivalent to the <m> \ell _ 1 </m> basis . note that we do not require that <m> X </m> contains no copy of <m> \ell _ 1 </m> , only that sequences in the basis do not give you copies of <m> \ell _ 1 </m> .
in `` the euler characteristic is the unique locally determined homotopy invariant of finite complexes '' on page 61 in the penultimate paragraph , levitt mentions that if one restricts to compact pl <m> 4 k </m> - manifolds then the signature is `` locally defined '' - i.e. that there is a real-valued function <m> d </m> on triangulated <m> ( 4 k - 1 ) </m> - spheres -LRB- up to simplicial-isomorphism -RRB- with the property that <m> \sigma ( M ) = \sum _ { v \in M ^ 0 } d ( \text { l i n k } ( v ) ) . </m> what is this function <m> d </m> ? i am particularly interested in the case where <m> k = 1 </m> .
the equivalence i describe below is well-known , but i 'd like a simple standard reference for it . consider <m> \mathbb { C } \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> , the set of one-dimensional subspaces of <m> \mathbb { C } ^ 2 </m> , which has a metric given by the angle between subspaces -LRB- varying between a minimum of <m> 0 </m> for identical subspaces and a maximum of <m> \frac \pi 2 </m> for a subspace and its unique orthogonal complement -RRB- and which has holomorphic isometry group <m> \mathrm { P U } ( 2 ) </m> . consider on the other hand <m> \frac 1 2 S ^ 2 </m> , the sphere of points distance <m> \frac 1 2 </m> from the origin in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 3 </m> , which has a metric given by great-circle distance -LRB- varying between a minimum of <m> 0 </m> for identical points and a maximum of <m> \frac \pi 2 </m> for a point and its unique antipode -RRB- and which has orientation-preserving isometry group <m> \mathrm { S O } ( 3 ) </m> . now define a map <m> \varphi : \mathbb { C } \mathbb { P } ^ 1 \to \frac 1 2 S ^ 2 </m> . the subspace spanned by <m> ( 0 , 1 ) </m> is sent by <m> \varphi </m> to the north pole <m> p = ( 0 , 0 , \frac 1 2 ) </m> . any other subspace is spanned by a uniquely defined vector <m> ( 1 , a + b i ) </m> , for <m> a </m> and <m> b </m> real and <m> i ^ 2 = - 1 </m> , and <m> \varphi </m> sends it to the point at which the open ray from <m> p </m> through <m> ( a , b , - \frac 1 2 ) </m> intersects <m> \frac 1 2 S ^ 2 </m> . -LRB- this is a shift of the standard stereographic projection to place the center of the sphere at the origin . -RRB- claim : the map <m> \varphi </m> is an isometry from <m> \mathbb { C } \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> to <m> \frac 1 2 S ^ 2 </m> , and the map from <m> f \in \mathrm { S O } ( 3 ) </m> to <m> g = \varphi ^ { - 1 } f \varphi \in \mathrm { P U } ( 2 ) </m> is an isomorphism of lie groups . the fact that the two lie groups are isomorphic is mentioned -LRB- without reference , by a sequence of isomorphisms -RRB- in wikipedia and the isometry also appears as a special case of something more specialized . i expect that some version of the equivalence i want is covered in any standard text on quantum computing , where <m> \mathbb { C } \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> is called the bloch sphere . if possible i would prefer not to use such specialized references for what is essentially a simple -LRB- but somewhat tedious to verify -RRB- piece of geometry .
suppose <m> G </m> is a topological group then classification theorem of principal <m> G </m> bundles says that
the reduced cg coefficients for <m> S O ( d ) : S O ( d - 1 ) </m> are in principle known in full generality for <m> d \leq 4 </m> : they are trivial for <m> d = 2 </m> , equivalent to <m> 3 j </m> symbols of <m> S U ( 2 ) </m> for <m> d = 3 </m> , and to <m> 9 j </m> symbols of <m> S U ( 2 ) </m> for <m> d = 4 </m> . for some classes of tensor products -LRB- e.g multiplicity-free tensor products -RRB- the reduced cg coefficients seem to be more or less known for general <m> d </m> . are the general reduced cg coefficients -LRB- or the full cg coefficients -RRB- known for <m> S O ( 5 ) : S O ( 4 ) </m> ? this definitely does not fall into the multiplicity-free category since already the adjoint representation has weight multiplicities . my motivation for this question comes from the fact that <m> S O ( d ) </m> cg coefficients are useful for describing three-point correlation functions in <m> ( d + 1 ) </m> - dimensional quantum conformal field theories and 6d cfts are a topic of active research .
given a topological space <m> Y </m> , let <m> \mathcal { P } ( Y ) </m> be the set of all probability measures on <m> Y </m> , endowed with the weak * topology . let <m> X </m> be a topological space -LRB- for convenience , it might be polish or compact -RRB- and let <m> f \colon \mathcal { P } ( \mathcal { P } ( X ) ) \to \mathcal { P } ( X ) </m> be defined by <m> f ( \mu ) ( E ) = \int \nu ( E ) \mu ( d \nu ) . </m> i can prove that each <m> f ( \mu ) </m> is well-defined . is <m> f </m> continuous ?
theorem . let <m> \{ ( R _ { \alpha } , V _ { \alpha } ) \} </m> be a complete set of inequivalent irreducible finite dimensional representations of a finite group <m> G </m> . let <m> V _ { R _ { \alpha } } </m> be the subspace generated by all matrix coefficients of <m> R _ { \alpha } </m> then the spaces <m> V _ { R _ { \alpha } } </m> are mutually orthogonal . moreover , they generate the space <m> C ( G , \mathbb { C } ) </m> question : in the following proof , is it necessary to show that the sum <m> \bigoplus _ { \alpha } V _ { R _ { \alpha } } </m> is nonzero ? thanks . proof : we show that <m> \bigoplus _ { \alpha } V _ { R _ { \alpha } } = C ( G , \mathbb { C } ) </m> . suppose the sum is a proper subspace of <m> C ( G , \mathbb { C } ) </m> . if the sum is zero , then <m> V _ { R _ { \alpha } } = 0 </m> for all <m> \alpha </m> . then all matrix coefficients of <m> R _ { \alpha } </m> is zero i.e. <m> R _ { \alpha } ( x ) \in G L _ { n } ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> is a zero matrix for all <m> x \in G </m> , contradiction . hence the sum is nonzero . now we show that for any <m> \alpha </m> , the space <m> V _ { R _ { \alpha } } </m> is invariant under the right regular representation <m> r </m> : for any <m> g \in G </m> and any matrix coefficient <m> f _ { u , v } \in V _ { R _ { \alpha } } </m> , we have <m> \big ( r ( g ) f _ { u , v } \big ) ( x ) = f _ { u , v } ( x g ) = \langle R _ { \alpha } ( x g ) u , v \rangle = \langle R _ { \alpha } ( x ) R ( g ) u , v \rangle = f _ { R ( g ) u , v } </m> hence the set of all matrix coefficients of <m> R _ { \alpha } </m> is invariant under <m> r </m> . by the linearity of <m> r ( g ) </m> , the space <m> V _ { R _ { \alpha } } </m> is also invariant . therefore the sum is invariant under <m> r </m> . we know that the orthogonal complement <m> W </m> of the sum is invariant under <m> r </m> . we may choose an invariant subspace <m> U </m> of <m> W </m> such that <m> r </m> is irreducible on <m> U </m> . let <m> \{ u _ 1 , . . . , u _ m \} </m> be an orthonormal basis of <m> U </m> . then each function <m> x \mapsto \langle r ( x ) u _ j , u _ i \rangle </m> is orthogonal to <m> U </m> by construction i.e. <m>  </m> f \ in u <m>  </m> consider the linear functional <m> L : U \to \mathbb { C } </m> defined by <m> L ( f ) = f ( 1 ) </m> . applying the riesz representation theorem , there is an element <m> f _ 0 \in U </m> such that <m> L ( f ) = \langle f , f _ 0 \rangle </m> . on the other hand , for any <m> f \in U </m> <m> f ( x ) = f ( 1 . x ) = ( r ( x ) f ) ( 1 ) = L ( r ( x ) f ) = \langle r ( x ) f , f _ 0 \rangle </m> then we have <m> 0 = \sum _ { x \in G } \langle r ( x ) u _ j , u _ i \rangle \overline { \langle r ( x ) f , f _ 0 \rangle } = \frac { | G | \langle u _ j , f \rangle \overline { \langle u _ i , f _ o \rangle } } { \dim U } </m> for all <m> i </m> and <m> j </m> . since we can take <m> f = u _ j = u _ 1 </m> and since <m> i </m> is arbitrary , this equation forces <m> f _ 0 = 0 </m> and gives a contradiction .
this is cross-posted in mse . i have seen two different kinds of definitions of the notation <m> C ^ k ( \overline { \Omega } ) </m> -- by `` extension '' of functions on <m> \Omega </m> or by `` restriction '' of functions on <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> . i 'm not sure about how different these two kinds of definitions could be .
i 'm starting to study geodesic laminations on hyperbolic surfaces and in particular i 'm focusing my attention on <m> \mathcal { P M L } _ 0 ( S ) </m> , the space of projective classes of measured geodesic laminations with compact support on the surface <m> S </m> . this space is compact -LRB- it is stated for example in the article `` on teichmueller 's metric and thurston 's asymmetric metric on teichmueller space '' by papadopoulos and theret -RRB- but i can not find a proof of this fact . i 've checked the uncompleted book `` closed curves on surfaces '' by bonahon : there it is proven that <m> \mathcal { P M L } ( S ) </m> -LRB- projective classes of measured geodesic laminations -RRB- is compact , but then i should prove that <m> \mathcal { P M L } _ 0 ( S ) </m> is closed in <m> \mathcal { P M L } ( S ) </m> and i have no clues . so : is <m> \mathcal { P M L } _ 0 ( S ) </m> closed in <m> \mathcal { P M L } ( S ) </m> ? why ? also , the proof of the compactness of <m> \mathcal { P M L } ( S ) </m> is given in a metric independent way -LRB- considering geodesic laminations as points in the boundary of the universal cover -RRB- which is less natural to me than the metric dependent fashion . can you provide me of a reference of a proof of the compactness of <m> \mathcal { P M L } _ 0 ( S ) </m> in a metric dependent way ?

what is the branching rule for the subgroup <m> S U ( p , q - 1 ) \subset S U ( p , q ) </m> , i.e. , the structure of the restriction of irreducible , finite-dimensional representations of <m> S U ( p , q ) </m> to <m> S U ( p , q - 1 ) </m> ? i would appreciate any reference and comments .
this is a question related to covers of <m> Z ^ \infty </m> . is it possible to cover <m> Z ^ k </m> , <m> k > 1 </m> , with the <m> l _ 1 </m> - metric by a constant -LRB- not depending on <m> k </m> -RRB- number of collections of subsets <m> U ^ 0 , . . . , U ^ c </m> where each <m> U ^ i </m> consists of uniformly bounded <m> \lambda </m> - disjoint sets <m> U _ j ^ i </m> -LRB- '' <m> \lambda </m> - disjoint '' means <m> d i s t ( U _ j ^ i , U _ l ^ i ) \ge \lambda </m> for every <m> i , j \not = l </m> -RRB- , <m> \lambda </m> is fixed , <m> > 1 </m> ? in http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1008.3868 , we show -LRB- lemma 3.7 -RRB- that for <m> k < 2 ^ { \lambda - 1 } </m> , the minimal <m> c </m> is <m> k </m> . the question is what happens for <m> k \ge 2 ^ { \lambda - 1 } </m> . update : the answer is not known even if <m> \lambda = 3 </m> .
let <m> X </m> be a irreducible closed subscheme of <m> \mathbb { P } ^ N _ { \mathbb { C } } </m> , and <m> U </m> is a nonempty open where <m> X </m> is smooth and moreover for every <m> x \in U </m> and for every line <m> l \subseteq X </m> with <m> x \in l </m> assume <m> l \subseteq X \setminus \mathrm { s i n g } ( X ) </m> . if <m> x \in U </m> , clearly <m> H i l b _ { l i n e s } ^ { x } ( X ) = H i l b _ { l i n e s } ^ { x } ( X _ { r e d } ) </m> as the identity of sets , but is it true as identity of schemes ? thanks .
i 'm writing a thesis on chow rings of toric varieties and am looking for a reference on the singular cohomology ring of the blowup of <m> \mathbb C ^ 2 </m> at xy = 0 , i.e. at the coordinate axes . the topological description of this blow up is <m> \mathbb C ^ 2 \sqcup \mathbb C ^ 2 \big / \left ( ( x , y ) _ 1 \sim ( x ^ { - 1 } , y ^ { - 1 } ) _ 2 \right ) _ { x , y \neq 0 } , </m> where <m> ( \cdot , \cdot ) _ 1 </m> and <m> ( \cdot , \cdot ) _ 2 </m> denote points in the first and second copy of <m> \mathbb C ^ 2 </m> , respectively . if there 's a way to calculate the cohomology ring from this topological description , i 'd be interested in it as well !
let <m> G = S y m ( a ) \wr S y m ( b ) </m> be a wreath product of symmetric groups - i 'm particularly interested in the weyl group of type <m> B </m> , <m> S y m ( 2 ) \wr S y m ( n ) </m> . let <m> k </m> be a field of characteristic <m> p </m> . what is <m> H ^ * ( G , k ) </m> ? if <m> i \leq p - 3 </m> and we 're in the symmetric group case , then <m> H ^ i ( S y m ( n ) , k ) = 0 </m> . if <m> i = 1 </m> and <m> G </m> is as above then <m> H ^ 1 ( G , k ) = 0 </m> , for all <m> a </m> and <m> b </m> , unless we 're in characteristic 2 . is anything else possible to say ? what i really want is that the symmetric group result generalises so that : if <m> i \leq p - 3 </m> , then <m> H ^ i ( G , k ) = 0 </m> for <m> i \leq p - 3 </m> , for <m> G </m> a wreath product as above . any ideas if this is true ? it might be that it holds with fewer restrictions on <m> i </m> and <m> G </m> - the proof i know for the symmetric group case uses the schur functor and tilting modules for <m> G L _ n </m> . however , the result proved is far more general -LRB- it concerns all specht modules -RRB- - so maybe this <m> G L _ n </m> approach is n't needed .
let <m> \mathcal { C } </m> be a minimal cyclic <m> A _ { \infty } </m> category , as considered in , say kajiura 's thesis , or kontsevich and soibelman 's deformation theory notes , or http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0412149 . i.e. it 's a minimal <m> A _ { \infty } </m> category in the usual sense , with a nondegenerate symmetric pairing <m> \langle \bullet , \bullet \rangle </m> between <m> \mathrm { E x t } ^ i ( x , y ) </m> and <m> \mathrm { E x t } ^ { n - i } ( y , x ) </m> such that <m> \langle m _ s ( \bullet , \ldots , \bullet ) , \bullet \rangle </m> is cyclically invariant -LRB- up to the usual sign horror -RRB- for every <m> s </m> , where the <m> m _ s </m> are the -LRB- higher -RRB- composition operations in the category <m> \mathcal { C } </m> . the number <m> n </m> here is fixed throughout . now say that <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> are isomorphic objects of <m> \mathcal { C } </m> , in the sense that there are morphisms <m> f : x \rightarrow y </m> and <m> g : y \rightarrow x </m> , such that <m> m _ 2 ( f , g ) = \mathrm { i d } _ y </m> and <m> m _ 2 ( g , f ) = \mathrm { i d } _ x </m> . my question is : is there a quick proof that <m> \mathrm { E n d } _ { \mathcal { C } } ( x ) </m> and <m> \mathrm { E n d } _ { \mathcal { C } } ( y ) </m> are isomorphic as cyclic <m> A _ { \infty } </m> algebras ? e.g. we want a morphism <m> F </m> of <m> A _ { \infty } </m> algebras such that <m> F _ 1 </m> pulls back the pairing <m> \langle \bullet , \bullet \rangle </m> and there are equalities <m> \sum _ { i + j = t } \langle F _ i , F _ j \rangle = 0 </m> for all <m> t \geq 3 </m> . while this is hopefully true , i ca n't find a reference anywhere , and unless f and g are strict , in the sense that they vanish for all higher compositions , i do n't see a quick proof .

let <m> E </m> be an elliptic curve defined over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> , and fix a weierstrass equation for <m> E </m> having coefficients in <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> . are there infinitely many primes <m> p \in \mathbb { Z } </m> such that the reduced curve <m> E / \mathbb { F } _ p </m> has hasse invariant <m> 1 </m> ?
let <m> X </m> be a banach space with basis <m> ( e _ n ) _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty </m> , and suppose that <m> ( x _ i ) _ { i = 1 } ^ \infty </m> is a normalized block basic sequence of <m> ( e _ n ) _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty </m> . in addition assume that <m> ( x _ i ) _ { i = 1 } ^ \infty </m> is subsymmetric , weakly null , and such that <m> \sup _ i \left \vert \text { s u p p } ( x _ i ) \right \vert = \infty </m> . my question : is it possible to extract a subsequence <m> ( x _ { n _ j } ) _ { j = 1 } ^ \infty </m> for which <m> \sup _ j \left \vert \text { s u p p } ( x _ { n _ j } ) \right \vert < \infty </m> ? perhaps find an equivalent normalized block basic sequence <m> ( y _ j ) _ { j = 1 } ^ \infty </m> of <m> ( e _ n ) _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty </m> for which <m> \sup _ j \left \vert \text { s u p p } ( y _ j ) \right \vert < \infty </m> ?
i 've recently encountered the notion of a universally baire set , and i 've tried to look at the paper by feng , magidor and woodin where this notion is studied . there are several points that confuse me . -LRB- 1 -RRB- first of all , what is the extend to which we know that various subsets of the reals have tree representations , i.e. , are <m> \kappa </m> - souslin for some cardinal <m> \kappa </m> ? is it correct that under ad , all projective set have a tree representation ? what about in solovay 's model ? do all subsets of the reals there have tree representations ? -LRB- it is not at all clear to me that being definable from a sequence of ordinals has anything to do with having a tree representation , but perhaps i am missing something obvious . -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- these points aside , what i am really interested in is trying to understand the relationship between the notion of a universally baire set and the paper by shelah called `` can you take solovay 's inaccessible away ? '' -LRB- isr . j. math , 1984 -RRB- . it at some point seemed to me that what maybe really is going on there -LRB- in the section about a model of zf where all sets have the baire property -RRB- is that shelah is proving that there is a model of zf in which all sets are <m> \omega </m> universally baire , or something close to this fact . -LRB- here , when i say <m> \omega </m> universally baire , i mean a subset <m> A </m> of baire space where there are trees <m> T </m> and <m> T ^ * </m> such that <m> p [ T ] = A </m> , <m> p [ T ^ * ] = A ^ c </m> , and in any forcing extension by a countable poset -LRB- cohen forcing -RRB- we have <m> p [ T ] \cup p [ T ^ { * } ] = \omega ^ \omega </m> . -RRB- so , basically my question is : is there a model of zf where all subsets of the reals are <m> \omega </m> universally baire ? and if yes , does this require a large cardinal hypothesis ? i hope someone can help , as i am completely new to much of this . even just some references where some basic things are more clearly explained would help a lot . thanks , r.a.d.
i am interested in explicit generators of the cohomology <m> H ^ \bullet ( S U ( n ) , \mathbb { Z } ) </m> . let <m> \omega = g ^ { - 1 } d g </m> be the maurer-cartan form on <m> S U ( n ) </m> . the forms <m> \alpha _ 3 , \alpha _ 5 , \dots , \alpha _ { 2 n - 1 } </m> , defined by <m> \alpha _ k : = \text { T r } ( \omega ^ { k } ) </m> are bi-invariant and define classes in de rham cohomology . it is well-known that the cohomology algebra <m> H ^ \bullet ( S U ( n ) , \mathbb { R } ) </m> is an exterior algebra in <m> \alpha _ 3 , \dots , \alpha _ { 2 n - 1 } </m> . more precisely , my question is thus the following : find the optimal constants <m> C _ k </m> such that <m> C _ k \cdot \alpha _ k </m> is an integral class . for <m> n = 2 </m> , i have found in the literature that <m> C _ 3 </m> is <m> ( 2 4 \pi ^ 2 ) ^ { - 1 } </m> . but i can not find a reference for the higher dimensions . i expect that <m> C _ k = q _ k \cdot \pi ^ { - ( k + 1 ) / 2 } </m> , with <m> q _ k </m> some rational number , because of the volume of the sphere <m> \mathbb { S } ^ { 2 k - 1 } </m> , but i have no precise proof . it seems from the comments in cohomology of the unitary group that an interpretation in terms of transgression can solve my problem but i am not very familiar with this . thanks !
the problem comes from a problem i encountered when i wrote the article find all positive integer <m> m </m> such <m> 2 ^ { m } + 1 \mid 5 ^ m - 1 </m> it seem there no solution . i think it might be necessary to use quadratic reciprocity knowledge to solve this problem . if <m> m </m> is odd then <m> 2 ^ m + 1 </m> is divisible by 3 but <m> 5 ^ m - 1 </m> is not . so <m> m </m> be even , take <m> m = 2 n </m> , then <m> 4 ^ n + 1 \mid 2 5 ^ n - 1 . </m> if <m> n </m> is odd , then <m> 4 ^ n + 1 </m> is divisible by <m> 5 </m> , but <m> 2 5 ^ n - 1 </m> is not so <m> n </m> is even , take <m> n = 2 p </m> , we have <m> 1 6 ^ p + 1 \mid 6 2 5 ^ p - 1 . </m>
is the set of prime numbers <m> p </m> such that <m> 4 3 2 p + 1 </m> is also prime infinite ? it does n't follow from dirichlet 's theorem as far as i can tell .
let <m> K </m> be a compact subset in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> with <m> m ( K ) = 0 </m> , suppose <m> s u p p \hat { u } \subset K </m> for some <m> u \in L ^ p </m> , where <m> 2 \leq p \leq \frac { 2 n } { n - 1 } </m> , can we get <m> u \equiv 0 </m> ? motivation : if <m> K </m> is a compact non-degenerate hypersurface , then it 's well known that <m> u ( x ) \leq C | x | ^ { - \frac { n - 1 } { 2 } } </m> , hence <m> u \in L ^ p </m> for any <m> p > \frac { 2 n } { n - 1 } </m> , but if we restrict <m> p </m> in <m> [ 2 , \frac { 2 n } { n - 1 } ] </m> , then is it possible that <m> u \equiv 0 </m> ? another related question : consider a linear partial differential operator <m> P ( D ) </m> with constant coefficients in <m> L ^ p </m> , it has been proven that <m> P ( D ) </m> has no eigenvalue when <m> 1 \leq p < \frac { 2 n } { n - 1 } </m> , the bound for <m> p </m> is best possible , in fact consider <m> - \triangle </m> act on <m> L ^ p </m> , <m> p > \frac { 2 n } { n - 1 } </m> , it 's known that <m> \sigma ( - \triangle ) = [ 0 , \infty ) </m> for all <m> p </m> , we now care about its point spectrum -LRB- eigenvalue -RRB- and it 's easy to check that <m> u = \hat { d \mu } </m> -LRB- where <m> d \mu </m> is the surface measure on -LCB- <m> | \xi | = s ^ 2 </m> -RCB- -RRB- is the eigenfunction of <m> - \triangle </m> with eigenvalue <m> s ^ 2 </m> , hence , in this case , <m> \sigma _ { p } ( - \triangle ) = ( 0 , \infty ) </m> . but for <m> p < \frac { 2 n } { n - 1 } </m> , <m> \sigma _ { p } ( - \triangle ) = \emptyset </m> , then what i am particularly interested in is the case when <m> p = \frac { 2 n } { n - 1 } </m> . is its point spectrum also empty ? edit for the first question , it suffice to show that <m> \mathcal { F ( S _ { K } ) } </m> is dense in such <m> L ^ p </m> , where <m> S _ { K } </m> ={ <m> \varphi \in C _ { 0 } ^ { \infty } ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) </m> , <m> \phi ( x ) = 0 </m> , when <m> x \in K </m> -RCB- , this is obvious when k consists of only discrete points , but for more complicated k -LRB- such as a low-dimension surface -RRB- , i do n't know how to deal with it right now .
take two points , <m> p _ 0 </m> and <m> p _ k </m> , in <m> n </m> - dimensional euclidean space , where <m> d ( p _ 0 , p _ k ) </m> is the distance between the points . now , draw an <m> n </m> - sphere of radius <m> r </m> centered on <m> p _ 0 </m> and uniformly select a new point , <m> p _ 1 </m> , in the volume of the sphere , and a new point <m> p _ 2 </m> on the surface of the sphere . let <m> h _ 1 = d ( p _ 0 , p _ k ) - d ( p _ 1 , p _ k ) </m> , and <m> h _ 2 = d ( p _ 0 , p _ k ) - d ( p _ 2 , p _ k ) </m> , represent the difference in the distance from <m> p _ 0 </m> to <m> p _ k </m> if <m> p _ 0 </m> is moved to <m> p _ 1 </m> or <m> p _ 2 </m> , respectively . to clarify , if we blow up another <m> n </m> - sphere , <m> S </m> , about <m> p _ k </m> until <m> p _ 0 </m> `` touches '' its contour , <m> h _ 1 </m> / <m> h _ 2 </m> will be positive if <m> p _ 1 </m> / <m> p _ 2 </m> is inside <m> S </m> , zero if <m> p _ 1 </m> / <m> p _ 2 </m> are on the contour of <m> S </m> , and negative if <m> p _ 1 </m> / <m> p _ 2 </m> fall outside <m> S </m> . what probability distribution and expectation do we have for <m> h _ 1 </m> and <m> h _ 2 </m> ? update -LSB- 2/15/2014 -RSB- : : thanks to bjørn kjos-hanssen 's efforts , we have a nice exact expression for the <m> n = 2 </m> case for <m> h _ 1 </m> -LRB- which implies that we have expectation -- <m> \int _ { 1 - r } ^ { 1 + r } \space R \times f ( R ) \space d R </m> -RRB- . at this point , i think its probably wise to restrict the focus or scope of this question to the <m> n = 2 </m> case . can a pdf for <m> h _ 2 </m> -LRB- where we select points along the contour of the circle -RRB- be derived in a similar manner ?
let <m> H </m> and <m> K </m> be hilbert spaces , and let <m> u </m> be a partial isometry in <m> \mathcal { B } ( H \otimes K ) </m> between projections <m> p _ 0 = u ^ \ast u </m> and <m> p _ 1 = u u ^ \ast </m> such that <m> p _ 0 , p _ 1 \leq 1 \otimes ( 1 - q ) </m> for some projection <m> q \in \mathcal B ( K ) </m> equivalent to <m> 1 \in \mathcal B ( K ) </m> . does <m> p _ 1 u ( a \otimes 1 ) p _ 0 = p _ 1 ( a \otimes 1 ) u p _ 0 </m> for all <m> a \otimes 1 \in \mathcal { B } ( H ) \otimes 1 </m> imply that <m> u </m> can be extended to a unitary operator in the commutant <m> ( \mathcal B ( H ) \otimes 1 ) ' = 1 \otimes \mathcal B ( K ) </m> ? i 've verified the implication for several simple examples , but i 'm having trouble proving it in full generality . update : i 've reworded the question for clarity thanks to yemon 's comments . by a unitary operator extending <m> u </m> , i mean a unitary operator that agrees with <m> u </m> on <m> p _ 0 ( \mathcal H \otimes \mathcal K ) </m> . update : here 's one example . let <m> K </m> be infinite dimensional with basis <m> e _ 1 , e _ 2 , \ldots </m> , and <m> H </m> be <m> n </m> - dimensional with bases <m> \xi _ 1 , \ldots , \xi _ n </m> and <m> \zeta _ 1 , \ldots , \zeta _ n </m> . let <m> \xi = \frac { 1 } { \sqrt n } \sum _ i \xi _ i \otimes e _ i </m> and <m> \zeta = \frac { 1 } { \sqrt n } \sum _ I \zeta _ i \otimes e _ i </m> . define <m> u \colon \eta \mapsto \langle \eta , \xi \rangle \zeta </m> . note that the assumptions in the first sentence are satisfied with <m> q </m> the projection on the span of <m> \{ e _ { n + 1 } , e _ { n + 2 } , \ldots \} </m> . the condition that <m> p _ 1 u ( a \otimes 1 ) p _ 0 = p _ 1 ( a \otimes 1 ) u p _ 0 </m> for all <m> a \otimes 1 \in \mathcal { B } ( H ) \otimes 1 </m> is here equivalent to <m> \langle u ( a \otimes 1 ) \xi , \zeta \rangle = \langle ( a \otimes 1 ) u \xi , \zeta \rangle </m> for all <m> a \in \mathcal B ( H ) </m> , which is in turn equivalent to <m> \langle ( a \otimes 1 ) \xi , \xi \rangle = \langle ( a \otimes 1 ) \zeta , \zeta \rangle </m> for all <m> a \in \mathcal B ( H ) </m> . the latter equation holds because both sides are equal to the trace of <m> a </m> . thus , all conditions are satisfied . to see that the conclusion holds , let <m> K _ n </m> be the span of <m> e _ 1 , \ldots , e _ n </m> , and let <m> c _ { i j } </m> be the unitary <m> n \times n </m> matrix such that <m> \zeta _ i = \sum _ j c _ { i j } \xi _ j </m> . then <m> u \xi = \zeta = \frac { 1 } { \sqrt n } \sum _ i \zeta _ i \otimes e _ i = \frac { 1 } { \sqrt n } \sum _ { i j } c _ { i j } \xi _ j \otimes e _ i = \frac { 1 } { \sqrt n } \sum _ j \xi _ j \otimes w e _ j = ( 1 \otimes w ) \xi , </m> where <m> w \colon K _ n \rightarrow K _ n </m> is the unitary defined by <m> w e _ j = \sum _ i c _ { i j } e _ i </m> . we extend <m> w </m> to all of <m> K </m> by setting <m> \tilde { w } = w \oplus 1 </m> . then <m> 1 \otimes \tilde w </m> is a unitary operator in <m> 1 \otimes B ( K ) </m> that extends <m> u </m> . i realized that the other examples i was thinking about are trivial .
i have two questions regarding to <m> p </m> - groups .
if we ask which natural numbers n are not expressible as <m> n = a b + b c + c a </m> -LRB- <m> 0 < a < b < c </m> -RRB- then this is a well known open problem . numbers not expressible in such form are called euler 's `` numerus idoneus '' and it is conjectured that they are finite . if we omit the condition <m> a < b < c </m> and assume <m> 0 < a \leq b \leq c </m> then it was proved -LRB- assuming generalized riemann hypothesis -RRB- that there is only a finite number of such numbers <m> n </m> . i am interested in the problem of expressing a prime number <m> p </m> as <m> p = a b + a c + b c </m> for <m> a \geq 1 </m> and <m> b , c \geq 2 </m> . anybody knows if there is some known result related to expressing prime numbers in such form ? this would yield -LRB- as a corollary -RRB- a very beautiful theorem related to spanning trees in graphs .
does there exist a probability distribution on <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> such that for every integer <m> n \geq 1 </m> , the probability that a random integer <m> x </m> is divisible by <m> n </m> equals <m> 1 / n </m> ? henry cohn has an argument why this is not possible , but it is not completely rigorous . first , it is easy to see that we can assume that the distribution is supported on the positive integers . let <m> p _ n </m> be the probability of <m> n </m> . for any function <m> f </m> on the positive integers for which we get convergence , we have -LRB- by the assumption on <m> p _ n </m> -RRB- <m> \sum _ k p _ k \sum _ { n | k } f ( n ) = \sum _ n \frac { f ( n ) } { n } . </m> let <m> g ( k ) = \sum _ { n | k } f ( n ) </m> . by möbius inversion , <m> f ( n ) = \sum _ { k | n } g ( k ) \mu ( n / k ) </m> . writing <m> n = m k </m> , the first equation becomes <m> \sum _ k p _ k g ( k ) = \sum _ k g ( k ) \sum _ m \frac { \mu ( m ) } { m k } . </m> this should hold for all <m> g </m> for which <m> \sum _ n f ( n ) / n </m> converges absolutely , so it should follow that <m> p _ k = \frac 1 k \sum _ m \frac { \mu ( m ) } { m } . </m> this is nonsense since first of all , <m> \sum _ m \mu ( m ) / m = 0 </m> -LRB- equivalent to the prime number theorem -RRB- , and even if we did n't know that , there 's no way <m> p _ k </m> can be proportional to <m> 1 / k </m> since <m> \sum 1 / k = \infty </m> . this argument is not completely rigorous since we have interchanged sums and equated coefficients of <m> g ( k ) </m> without justification . it 's also a problem that <m> \sum _ m \mu ( m ) / m </m> is conditionally convergent .
one of the remarkable results in toen 's paper is the existence of internal homs of dg-categories . actually for two dg-categories <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> , there exists a dg-category <m> R H o m ( A , B ) </m> such that for any dg-category <m> C </m> we have <m> [ C \otimes ^ L A , B ] \cong [ C , R H o m ( A , B ) ] , </m> where <m> [ - , - ] </m> means the map in hqe , the homotopy category of dg-cat after inverting all quasi-equivalences . from the definition it is clear that for <m> B \simeq C </m> in hqe , we must have <m> R H o m ( A , B ) \simeq R H o m ( A , C ) </m> in hqe for any dg-category <m> A </m> . my question is whether the inverse is true , i.e. for <m> A </m> , <m> B </m> , and <m> C </m> dg-categories where <m> A </m> is not quasi-equivalent to the empty category . does <m> R H o m ( A , B ) \simeq R H o m ( A , C ) </m> imply <m> B \simeq C </m> in hqe ? if not , do we have counter examples ?
let <m> X </m> be the <m> \mathbb { C } \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> with <m> n </m> points deleted . let <m> n \geq 3 </m> . if i understand correctly , the universal covering of <m> X </m> is isomorphic to the upper half plane as a complex analytic space .
consider two variants on self - -LRB- vertex - -RRB- avoiding random walks on <m> \Bbb { Z } ^ 2 </m> : -LRB- a -RRB- `` legal '' steps consist of any step not ending on a vertex previously visited , and the probabilities of each of the 1 , 2 , or 3 legal steps at any given time are equal . since this sarw will a.s. become `` trapped '' and encounter a state with no legal moves at some time <m> \tau </m> , for our purposes we extend the definition of the walk to say that it remains at the trapped vertex for all <m> t \geq \tau </m> . -LRB- b -RRB- `` legal '' steps consist of any step not ending on a vertex previously visited , such that there exists a path using only previously unused vertices that extends to a point more distant in each of <m> | x | </m> and <m> | y | </m> than the historically most distant point . this is always possible -LRB- since any state from which there are no legal moves must have been preceded by an earlier state with no legal moves -RRB- . again the probabilities of each of the 1 , 2 , or 3 legal steps at any given time are equal -LRB- although some moves that would have been legal for a type -LRB- a -RRB- sarw are now omitted from the set of legal steps -RRB- . the type -LRB- b -RRB- sarw can never become trapped , and extension to indefinite time <m> \tau </m> is natural . i am trying to study the behavior , for large integer time <m> t </m> , of the expected value of the -LRB- euclidean-metric -RRB- distance squared from the origin <m> d ( t ) = E \left ( x ( t ) ^ 2 + y ( t ) ^ 2 \right ) </m> -LRB- for an ordinary 2-d random walk , which i label variety <m> 0 </m> . i believe it is well known that <m> d _ 0 ( t ) = t </m> . -RRB- for the non-trapping type -LRB- b -RRB- sarw , one might intuitively expect that the `` pressure '' of not being able to easily return to the crowded region near the origin would force <m> d _ B ( t ) \geq d _ 0 ( t ) = t </m> and indeed this is the case ; in fact , the inequality is strict for <m> t \geq 4 </m> . but the mildly surprising observation is that nonetheless <m> d _ B ( t ) </m> appears to be grow as <m> \Theta ( t ) </m> , and in fact it seems to be asymptotic to <m> C t </m> with <m> C = 1 </m> . so the questions about -LRB- b -RRB- are :
the balanced polygamma function <m> \Psi ^ { ( s ) } ( x ) </m> for <m> x = 1 </m> can be expressed as : <m> \Psi ^ { ( s ) } ( 1 ) = \dfrac { \big ( \Psi ( - s ) + \gamma \big ) \, \zeta ( s + 1 ) + \zeta ' ( s + 1 ) } { \Gamma ( - s ) } </m> note <m> \Psi ( s ) </m> is the digamma function and <m> \gamma </m> the euler -- mascheroni constant . <m> \Psi ^ { ( s ) } ( 1 ) </m> has complex zeros and it appears their real parts all reside in a strip within <m> [ - 1 , - \frac 1 2 ] </m> . their imaginary parts seem correlated and get closer to <m> \Im ( \rho ) </m> for increased <m> T </m> -LRB- <m> \rho </m> is a non-trivial zero of <m> \zeta ( s ) </m> -RRB- . however , numerical evidence suggests the complex zeros -LRB- real ones exist as well -RRB- of <m> \Psi ^ { ( s ) } ( 1 ) \pm \Psi ^ { ( 1 - s ) } ( 1 ) </m> all reside on the critical line <m> \Re ( s ) = \frac 1 2 </m> . only focusing on the critical strip <m> 0 \lt \Re ( s ) \lt 1 </m> allows rewriting <m> \zeta ( s + 1 ) </m> and <m> \zeta ' ( s + 1 ) </m> into : <m> \frac { 1 } { \Gamma ( - s ) } \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \frac { \gamma + \Psi ( - s ) - \ln ( n ) } { n ^ { s + 1 } } \pm \frac { 1 } { \Gamma ( s - 1 ) } \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \frac { \gamma + \Psi ( s - 1 ) - \ln ( n ) } { n ^ { 2 - s } } </m> another approach could be to express <m> \zeta ( s + 1 ) </m> and <m> \zeta ( 2 - s ) </m> as their euler-products . is there a way to simplify this further or to prove that all complex zeros are on the line <m> \Re ( s ) = \frac 1 2 </m> ? the graph below illustrates the claim for <m> \Psi ^ { ( s ) } ( 1 ) - \Psi ^ { ( 1 - s ) } ( 1 ) </m> . -LRB- note : at a first glance the distribution of the zeros looks deceitfully regular ; however , small distortions do seem to occur in the vicinity of the <m> \rho </m> s. -RRB-
the mostow decomposition theorem states : let <m> Z </m> a nonsingular complex matrix , then <m> Z </m> can be factored as : <m> Z = W e ^ { i K } e ^ S </m> where : <m> W </m> is unitary , <m> K </m> is real and skew symmetric and <m> S </m> is real and symmetric . given a complex matrix <m> Z </m> how is it possible to find <m> K , S , W </m> ? thanks

a recent preprint on arxiv brought my attention on the notion of <m> n </m> - recollement -LRB- def . 2 -RRB- a generalization of the notion of recollement among three abelian or triangulated categories behaving like a `` short exact sequence '' of such objects .
let <m> A , B , C \in \mathbb { R } ^ { n \times n } </m> be such that <m> \left ( \begin {array} { } A & B \\ B ^ T & C \end {array} \right ) \succeq 0 </m> . i would like to prove that <m> \mathrm { t r a c e } \, B \le \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n \sqrt { \lambda _ i ( A ) \lambda _ i ( C ) } , </m> where for any symmetric <m> M \in \mathbb { R } ^ { n \times n } </m> , <m> \lambda _ 1 ( M ) \le \lambda _ 2 ( M ) \le \cdots \le \lambda _ n ( M ) </m> denote the sorted eigenvalues of <m> M </m> . using svd , schur complement and von-neumann 's trace inequality i am able to show that the above by is true if <m> \mathrm { t r a c e } \, \left ( \left [ \Sigma G ^ 2 \Sigma \right ] ^ { 1 / 2 } G ^ { - 1 } \right ) \ge \mathrm { t r a c e } \, \Sigma </m> for every <m> G \succ 0 </m> and diagonal <m> \Sigma \succeq 0 </m> ; according to simulations random matrices seem to satisfy this . this inequality follows from a simple symmetry argument if <m> f ( G ) = \mathrm { t r a c e } \, \left ( \left [ \Sigma G ^ 2 \Sigma \right ] ^ { 1 / 2 } G ^ { - 1 } \right ) </m> happens to be operator-convex , but i have so far not been able to prove this .
according to the kneser-milnor prime decomposition theorem for 3-manifolds , any compact , connected , orientable 3-manifold <m> M </m> is diffeomorphic to <m> S ^ 3 / \Gamma _ 1 </m> # <m> \cdots </m> # <m> S ^ 3 / \Gamma _ n </m> # <m> ( S ^ 2 \times S ^ 1 ) _ 1 </m> # <m> \cdots </m> # <m> ( S ^ 2 \times S ^ 1 ) _ r </m> # <m> K ( \pi _ 1 , 1 ) </m> # <m> \cdots </m> # <m> K ( \pi _ m , 1 ) </m> , where # is the connect sum , and <m> \Gamma _ i </m> is a non-trivial finite subgroup of <m> S O ( 4 ) </m> acting orthogonally to <m> S ^ 3 </m> -LRB- so that the result is a spherical space form -RRB- . i suppose my question boils down to if <m> \pi _ 1 ( M ) = \mathbb { Z } \times \cdots \times \mathbb { Z } </m> , k times , does that uniquely identify a manifold as a <m> ( S ^ 2 \times S ^ 1 ) _ 1 </m> # <m> \cdots </m> # <m> ( S ^ 2 \times S ^ 1 ) _ k </m> , or can the various quotient manifolds or aspherical factors create a more complicated topology without changing the fundamental group ?
it is known that if <m> Q </m> is an indefinite non-degenerate quadratic form on <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> with <m> n \ge 3 </m> , then any maximal compact subgroup <m> K </m> of the orthogonal group <m> S O ( Q ) </m> acts transitively on the projectiviziation of the light cone . in other words , if <m> Q ( x ) = Q ( y ) = 0 </m> for non-zero vectors <m> x , y \in \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> , then there exists <m> g \in K </m> , with <m> g x = \lambda y </m> for some <m> \lambda \neq 0 </m> . my question concerned the <m> p </m> - adic situation : suppose <m> Q </m> is non-degenerate quadratic form on <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p ^ n </m> which is isotropic , i.e. the equation <m> Q ( x ) = 0 </m> has a non-zero solution <m> x \in \mathbb { Q } _ p ^ n </m> and <m> n \ge 3 </m> . it is well-know that there may be more than one conjugacy classes of the maximal compact subgroups . my question is : is there at least one such maximal compact subgroup that acts transitively on the projectiviziation of the light cone ?
let <m> E </m> be an elliptic curve over <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> , <m> p > 2 </m> a prime and <m> n , s \in \mathbb { N } </m> . for <m> j \in \{ 1 , . . . , s \} </m> let <m> n _ { j } \in \mathbb { N } </m> be a natural number which may or may not be coprime to <m> p </m> . let <m> K / \mathbb { Q } </m> be an imaginary quadratic extension so that the heegner hypothesis holds -LRB- i.e. the primes dividing <m> N </m> split -RRB- . the heegner point of conductor <m> c </m> is denoted <m> y _ { c } </m> and defined over <m> K [ c ] </m> , the ray class field of conductor <m> c </m> . it is given by a map <m> ( \mathbb { C } / \mathcal O _ c \rightarrow \mathbb C / \mathfrak N _ c ) </m> where <m> \mathcal O _ c = \mathbb Z + c \mathcal O _ K </m> , <m> \mathfrak N _ c = \mathfrak N \cap \mathcal O _ c </m> and <m> N </m> splits as <m> \mathfrak N \overline { \mathfrak N } </m> . if <m> l </m> is a prime , let <m> K [ c ] _ { \lambda } </m> be the localization of <m> K [ c ] </m> at any prime <m> \lambda </m> above <m> l </m> . question 1 :
solve <m> f ( x ) = \int _ { x - 1 } ^ { x + 1 } f ( t ) \mathrm { d } t </m> . when <m> f </m> is a function , it looks like the only solution is <m> f ( x ) = 0 </m> . but what if we allow distributions , such as the dirac delta ?
let <m> p </m> be a prime number and <m> k \geq 2 </m> an even integer . consider the following <m> p </m> - adic integer : <m> S _ { p , k } : = \lim _ { r \to + \infty } \sum _ { a = 1 } ^ { p ^ r } \big ( \frac { p ^ r } { a } \big ) ^ k </m> convergence is easy to see . this can also be written as <m> S _ { p , k } = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sum _ { 0 \neq x \in B _ p } x ^ { - k } </m> where <m> \begin {aligned} B _ p & : = \big \{ \frac { a } { p ^ r } \; : \; a \in \mathbb { Z } , \; r \in \mathbb { N } , \; | a | _ { \infty } \leq p ^ r \big \} \\ & = \{ x \in \mathbb { Q } : | x | _ v \leq 1 \text { a t a l l p l a c e s } v \neq p \} \\ \end {aligned} </m> -LRB- here , <m> | \cdot | _ \infty </m> is the usual real absolute value , and `` places '' -LSB- of <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> -RSB- mean either a prime <m> \ell </m> or the symbol <m> \infty </m> . -RRB- the point of this last presentation is that it suggests the analogy with <m> B _ \infty = \mathbb { Z } </m> , where <m> S _ { \infty , k } = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { + \infty } n ^ { - k } </m> is the usual riemann zeta function -LRB- at even integers -RRB- : in a certain sense , the <m> S _ { p , k } </m> are a <m> p </m> - adic analogue of the <m> \zeta ( k ) </m> -LRB- though probably not the most intelligent or satisfactory analogue -RRB- . question -LRB- s -RRB- : have these <m> S _ { p , k } </m> appeared in the literature ? do they have a name ? do they satisfy some known relations ? -LRB- e.g. , can <m> S _ { p , 4 } </m> be expressed in function of <m> S _ { p , 2 } ^ 2 </m> ? experimentally , the ratio <m> S _ { p , 4 } / S _ { p , 2 } ^ 2 </m> does not appear to be rational , but maybe something else can be said . -RRB- for what it 's worth , wolstenholme 's theorem <m> \sum _ { a = 1 } ^ { p - 1 } \frac { 1 } { a ^ 2 } \equiv 0 \pmod { p } </m> tells us that <m> S _ { p , 2 } \equiv 1 \pmod { p ^ 4 } </m> . there seem to be many generalizations in various directions -LRB- see , e.g. , here -RRB- involving bernoulli numbers , kummer congruences , or the kubota-leopoldt <m> p </m> - adic zeta function , but i could n't find a direct connection with the above quantity .
given an undirected graph -LRB- <m> V </m> vertices , <m> E </m> edges -RRB- with maximum vertex degree <m> < k </m> i want to find a vertex coloring using exactly <m> k </m> colors so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color and for each vertex there exists a path starting in it such that no two vertices on this path has the same color and it contains exactly <m> k </m> vertices . additionaly , i know that in this graph there is at least one cycle of length exactly <m> k </m> . have you got any ideas how to tackle this problem ?

let <m> m = p _ 1 \ldots p _ k </m> be the prime factorization of some positive integer <m> m </m> and <m> k \geq 2 </m> . let <m> d _ 1 , \ldots , d _ { \tau ( m ) } </m> be all divisors of <m> m </m> , where <m> \tau ( m ) </m> counts the number of divisors of <m> m </m> . for a given <m> k </m> , i am trying to find the minimal number of different values in the sequence <m> ( \mu ( d _ i ) \varphi ( d _ i ) ) _ { i = \overline { { 1 , \tau ( m ) } } } </m> , where <m> \varphi </m> and <m> \mu </m> are euler 's totient and mobius functions , respectively . it seems very likely to me that the value is equal to <m> 2 ( { { k - 2 } \choose { 3 } } + { { k } \choose { 2 } } + 1 ) </m> . moreover , is it possible to find <m> p _ 1 , \ldots , p _ k </m> such that the number of different values of the sequence is equal to some given <m> l </m> , where <m> l </m> takes the values between lower and uper bound ? thank you in advance for any suggestion .
let <m> d </m> be a nonnegative integer , and let the sequence <m> { F _ d ( n ) } </m> be defined as follows : <m> F _ d ( n ) = 1 </m> for <m> n = 0 , 1 , \ldots , d </m> <m> F _ d ( n ) = F _ d ( n - 1 ) + F _ d ( n - 1 - d ) </m> for <m> n > d </m> for <m> d = 0 </m> the sequence becomes : <m> F _ 0 ( n ) = F _ 0 ( n - 1 ) + F _ 0 ( n - 1 ) </m> for <m> n > 0 </m> and <m> F _ 0 ( 0 ) = 1 </m> , so it is a sequence of powers of <m> 2 </m> . for <m> d = 1 </m> the sequence becomes : <m> F _ 1 ( n ) = F _ 1 ( n - 1 ) + F _ 1 ( n - 2 ) </m> for <m> n > 1 </m> and <m> F _ 1 ( 0 ) = F _ 1 ( 1 ) = 1 </m> , so it is a fibonacci sequence . for <m> d = 2 </m> the sequence is known as narayana 's cows sequence . the sequence looks quite interesting to me , but for now i 'm particularly interested in how fast it grows . to be more specific , i want to be able to calculate the number of digits of <m> F _ d ( n ) </m> for arbitrary <m> d </m> and <m> n </m> -LRB- <m> n </m> can be very big -RRB- . i can do it for <m> d = 0 </m> and <m> d = 1 </m> , since i know the closed formula for <m> F _ d ( n ) </m> in those cases . but what about arbitrary <m> d </m> ?
what are some examples of natural true statements of the form <m> n ( n ) </m> -LRB- <m>  </m> is a polynomial time computation/test -RRB- that are unprovable in <m> S ^ 1 _ 2 </m> ? examples may be unconditional or dependent on reasonable computational complexity conjectures . while this class of statements naturally corresponds to correctness of polynomial time algorithms -LRB- where correctness of the output is conp -RRB- , much of mathematics is reflected in these statements , including , for example , fermat 's last theorem if it is stated in a way that does not require exponentiation to be total , as well as various numeric tests of open conjectures in number theory . <m> S ^ 1 _ 2 </m> is in some ways the weakest natural base theory for reverse mathematics . it consists of basic arithmetical axioms , closure of unary numbers under multiplication , and polynomial induction on np predicates : <m> ( 0 ) n ( ( n ) ( 2 n ) ( 2 n + 1 ) ) n ( n ) </m> where <m>  </m> is an np formula -LRB- i.e. φ is <m> ^ b _ 1 </m> ; φ may have other free variables ; numbers are binary numbers -RRB- . it is closely connected to polynomial time computation : an <m> S ^ 1 _ 2 </m> proof of <m> x y ( x , y ) </m> -LRB- <m>  </m> is an np formula -RRB- can be converted into a polynomial time algorithm for finding an example <m> y </m> given <m> x </m> -LRB- however , the conversion uses cut-elimination and is not polynomial in proof length -RRB- . for this class of formulas , <m> S ^ 1 _ 2 </m> is conservative over pv <m> _ 1 </m> , which is -LRB- modulo choice of language and formalization -RRB- <m> S ^ 1 _ 2 </m> with the polynomial induction restricted to <m>  </m> that are polynomial time computations . it remains open whether <m> S ^ 1 _ 2 </m> proves p = pspace , but assuming plausible computational complexity conjectures , there are sharp limits on provability in <m> S ^ 1 _ 2 </m> . for example , if factoring is hard , then <m> S ^ 1 _ 2 </m> does not prove that every nonprime number -- as tested , for example , by aks primality test -- has a nontrivial factor -LRB- and conversely , the ordinary definition of prime numbers would not provably satisfy many results in number theory -RRB- . however , these examples can be conceptually grouped with <m> ^ 0 _ 2 </m> statements in that unprovability depends on number/set existence axioms beyond the power of the base theory . a recurring conjecture is that while the proofs may be hard , the propositions are usually provable if we have have the required existence axioms and basic properties . a plausible conjecture is that typical -LRB- in current mathematical and computer science literature -RRB- true statements of the form <m> n ( n ) </m> -LRB- polynomial time computable <m>  </m> -RRB- are already provable in <m> S ^ 1 _ 2 </m> . the answers may illuminate how accurately the conjecture holds , or show clear limits to this type of polynomial time reasoning .
we have an algebraic complex number <m> \alpha </m> such that <m> | \alpha | = 1 </m> and it is not a root of unity , we also know that <m> \alpha \in \mathcal { O } _ { \mathbb { Q } ( \alpha ) } </m> -LRB- ring of integers -RRB- . i need to study the behavoir of <m> N _ { \mathbb { Q ( \alpha ) } / \mathbb { Q } } ( 1 - \alpha ^ n ) </m> when <m> n \rightarrow \infty </m> . could someone give me a bibliographic reference ?
what is known about the homeomorphism -LRB- or homotopy -RRB- type of the group of <m> C ^ \infty </m> diffeomorphisms of <m> S ^ 2 </m> equipped with <m> C ^ 0 </m> topology ? the group is the image of the inclusion <m> \mathrm { D i f f } ( S ^ 2 ) \to \mathrm { H o m e o } ( S ^ 2 ) </m> , where <m> \mathrm { D i f f } ( S ^ 2 ) </m> has <m> C ^ \infty </m> topology . the inclusion is -LRB- i think -RRB- a homotopy equivalence , yet it is not a homeomorphism onto its image , so it does not seem to help answer the question .
is there an integer <m> m \geq 1 </m> such that <m> 2 ^ m + 3 ^ m </m> is a perfect power ?
for a continuous function <m> f : [ a , b ] \to R </m> there is a natural and obvious procedure to approximate it with a sequence of continuous , piecewise linear functions : take <m> N </m> equally spaced points in <m> [ a , b ] </m> and join the corresponding points in the graph of <m> f </m> with segments . if <m> f </m> is <m> C ^ 1 </m> , this method has the additional benefit that it converges in the lipschitz norm , without any tweaking . is there an equally simple procedure for functions of several variables ? what is the most natural definition of a continuous , piecewise linear approximation for a continuous function <m> f : [ a , b ] ^ 2 \to R </m> , having the ` best possible ' properties concerning <m> D f </m> when <m> f </m> is assumed to be <m> C ^ 1 </m> ? the last part of the question is vague since i do not know exactly what to expect ; ideally , i would like the approximating sequence to converge also in the lipschitz norm . note that piecewise linear functions , even in 1d , are not dense in lip , but i want to approximate a <m> C ^ 1 </m> function . background : i am writing some notes for an advanced calculus course , and a simple piecewise linear approximation procedure would greatly simplify some proofs . since this must be a very familiar problem to people working in more applied fields , i thought it might be a good idea to ask them before rediscovering the wheel .
i am working in data science and i have to deal with the following problem for which i would like to find a simplification : we call a function almost positive if <m> f ( x _ 1 , y _ 1 ) f ( x _ 2 , y _ 2 ) - f ( x _ 1 , y _ 2 ) f ( x _ 2 , y _ 1 ) \ge 0 </m> for all <m> 0 < x _ 1 \le x _ 2 < \infty </m> and <m> 0 < y _ 1 \le y _ 2 < \infty . </m> i would like to know : are there any sufficient and necessary criteria for a function <m> f </m> to be almost positive ? background : the problem is that i often have a positive smooth function <m> f </m> which i need to check for almost positivity . those functions <m> f </m> are usually cumbersome expressions such that checking <m> f ( x _ 1 , y _ 1 ) f ( x _ 2 , y _ 2 ) - f ( x _ 1 , y _ 2 ) f ( x _ 2 , y _ 1 ) \ge 0 </m> is almost impossible analytically , because one has to compare infinitely many variables which each other and unless one can simplify the expression in a clever way , checking this condition is hopeless . i am therefore asking whether there is an equivalent criterion to the almost positivity condition which i can check in a more direct way ? ideally there would exist an `` intrinsic '' criterion for functions <m> f </m> which implies this property . if there is nothing equivalent to almost positivity , perhaps there exist rather general sufficient conditions which imply almost positivity ?
let <m> p </m> be an odd prime . here i introduce the sum <m> S _ p ( c , d ) : = \sum _ { x = 0 } ^ { ( p - 1 ) / 2 } \left ( \frac { x ^ 5 + c x ^ 3 + d x } p \right ) </m> with <m> c , d \in \mathbb Z </m> , where <m> ( \frac { \cdot } p ) </m> is the legendre symbol . i have a series of conjectures on such sums . here i state two general ones . conjecture 1 . let <m> p > 7 </m> be a prime with <m> p \equiv 3 \pmod 4 </m> , and let <m> c , d \in \mathbb Z </m> . if <m> S _ p ( c , d ) = 0 </m> , then <m> \left ( \frac { c ^ 2 - 4 d } p \right ) = 1 \not = \left ( \frac d p \right ) . </m> remark 1 . i have verified this for all primes <m> 7 < p < 1 0 0 0 </m> with <m> p \equiv 3 \pmod 4 </m> . note that <m> S _ 3 ( 1 , 1 ) = 0 </m> but <m> ( \frac { 1 ^ 2 - 4 \cdot 1 } 3 ) = 0 </m> and <m> ( \frac 1 p ) = 1 </m> , and that <m> S _ 7 ( 5 , 1 ) = S _ 7 ( 6 , 2 ) = 0 </m> but <m> ( \frac { 5 ^ 2 - 4 \cdot 1 } 7 ) = ( \frac { 6 ^ 2 - 4 \cdot 2 } 7 ) = 0 </m> and <m> ( \frac 1 7 ) = ( \frac 2 7 ) = 1 </m> . conjecture 2 . let <m> p \equiv 1 \pmod 4 </m> be a prime , and let <m> c , d \in \mathbb Z </m> . -LRB- i -RRB- if <m> d ^ { ( p - 1 ) / 4 } \equiv - 1 \pmod p </m> -LRB- i.e. , <m> d </m> is a quadratic residue and a quartic nonresidue mod <m> p </m> -RRB- , then <m> S _ p ( c , d ) = 0 </m> . -LRB- ii -RRB- if <m> S _ p ( c , d ) = 0 </m> but <m> d ^ { ( p - 1 ) / 4 } \not \equiv - 1 \pmod p </m> , then <m> \left ( \frac { c ^ 2 - 4 d } p \right ) = \left ( \frac d p \right ) . </m> remark 2 . i have verified conjecture 2 for all primes <m> p < 5 0 0 </m> with <m> p \equiv 1 \pmod 4 </m> . i 'll pose more conjectures later .
by `` regular '' , i 'm going by a property of delaunay triangulation , which is to maximize the minimum angle . in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> , tiling with equilateral triangles gives you a minimum angle of 60 degrees . any other triangulation would give you a smaller minimum angle , so in this sense , triangulating <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> with equilateral triangles is the most regular way . what 's the best way to triangulate <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 3 </m> so that the minimum solid angle of the tetrahedra is maximized ? i assume that the dual tessellation of closely-packed spheres would give a good triangulation since that works in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> . you get some regular tetrahedra and regular octahedra which can be divided into 4 congruent tetrahedra which contain the minimum solid angle . is there a way to check if this is maximized ?
let <m> f : \mathbb { R } \to \mathbb { R } </m> be a real analytic function . assume that <m> f </m> has simple trivial zeros at each nonpositive integer . then , all the <m> k </m> - th derivatives <m> f ^ { ( k ) } </m> of <m> f </m> have necessarily infinitely many real zeros . let us consider the functions : <m> f ^ { ( k ) } ( 1 - 2 \prod _ { j = 1 } ^ { k } t _ { j } ) </m> for <m> k = 1 , . . , r </m> and <m> ( t _ 1 , t _ 2 , . . . , t _ { r } ) \in ( 0 , 1 ) ^ { r } </m> . we know that these functions have also infinitely many real zeros . my question is : how i can choose <m> ( t _ 1 , t _ 2 , . . . , t _ { k } ) ( 0 , 1 ) ^ { k } </m> such that <m> f ^ { ( k ) } ( 1 - 2 \prod _ { j = 1 } ^ { k } t _ { j } ) = 0 </m> and <m> f ^ { ( k + 1 ) } ( 1 - 2 \prod _ { j = 1 } ^ { k } s _ { j } ) \neq 0 </m> that is , the real <m> ( 1 - 2 \prod _ { j = 1 } ^ { k } s _ { j } ) </m> is a simple root of the function <m> f ^ { ( k ) } </m> ?
the term <m> f ( x ) </m> is available numerically . it was curve fitted to some function of <m> x </m> . i 've used dsolve in matlab . it reported that solution ca n't be found . i tried solving the above equation using finite differences with the derivative applied at the boundary using forward differences . as i change my step size the solution takes a different form apart from increasing its amplitude over the domain of <m> x </m> . then implemented orthogonal collocation and orthogonal collocation on finite elements . the solution did n't converge . but when the term <m> 1 / x </m> is removed from the ode , the solution converges . thanks and regards , tilak
let <m> Y </m> be a banach space isomorphic to <m> \ell _ p </m> , <m> 1 < p < \infty </m> . is it true that any finite subset of <m> \ell _ p </m> is isometric to some finite subset of <m> Y </m> ? it seems to me that it is an interesting question . it can be regarded as a special case of a recent question under which conditions is it possible to find points with same distances under bi-lipschitz map -LRB- which was closed -RRB- and is related to my -LRB- unanswered -RRB- question isometric embeddings of finite subsets of <m> \ell _ 2 </m> into infinite-dimensional banach spaces in connection with this question it is worth mentioning that there is a theory developed by krivine in ann . math . -LRB- 2 -RRB- 104 , 1-29 -LRB- 1976 -RRB- -LRB- with important additions by maurey and pisier -LRB- stud . math . 58 , 45-90 -LRB- 1976 -RRB- -RRB- and further simplifications by other authors , see chapter 12 in the book by benyamini-lindenstrauss on geometric nonlinear functional analysis or part ii in the book milman-schechtman on asymptotic theory -RRB- which implies that for any <m> \varepsilon > 0 </m> any finite-dimensional subspace of <m> \ell _ p </m> embeds into any banach space isomorphic to <m> \ell _ p </m> with distortion <m> \le ( 1 + \varepsilon ) </m> . added on 4/3/2017 : in a recent paper james kilbane proved that the set of possible counterexamples -LRB- if they exist -RRB- is small in a certain sense .
let <m> G </m> be a locally compact group . a measure <m> \mu </m> is the right-haar measure on <m> G </m> if for every <m> g \in G </m> and <m> E \subseteq G </m> borel set <m> \mu ( E g ) = \mu ( E ) </m> . it is known that every locally compact group has a unique right-haar measure -LRB- up to a multiplicative constant -RRB- . similarly one can define the left-haar measure as being invariant for left shifts . however , in the case <m> G </m> is compact this distinction is irrelevant , since both left and right haar measures are equivalent up to a constant -LRB- note that <m> G </m> is not nececssarily commutative , so being left and right haar measures are in fact two different properties -RRB- . i am interested on a natural notion of entropy for measures on compact groups . in this case i expect the haar measure to maximize the entropy . is there an analog of information theory developed in this framework ? i am particularly interested in the case where i am particularly interested on the case where <m> G = O ( n ) </m> , the group of orthogonal transformations of <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> . any references or insights are greatly welcome ! ---------------------------- update ------------------------------ due to a request , i will further explain . before i start , for notation and definitions i refer to cover & thomas book -LRB- elements of information theory -RRB- . my question is very much related to intrinsic significance of differential entropy : in the case of real random variables , differential entropy is troublesome due to the fact that there is no canonical reference space -LRB- in the discrete case , we are always working with r.v. 's over <m> \{ 1 , \ldots , n \} </m> -RRB- , so for example differential entropy is not invariant under re-scalings , since <m> h ( a X ) = h ( X ) + \log ( a ) , </m> as opposed to the discrete case where <m> h ( a X ) = h ( X ) </m> . however , in the case your r.v. 's are defined over a compact group <m> G </m> -LRB- we may restrict here to the ones that are absolutely continuous w.r.t. haar -RRB- , the re-scaling problem disappears , as we have a reference space <m> G </m> . i wonder if having this reference space helps at all in terms of having information-theoretic identities/inequalities similar to the discrete case -LRB- e.g. , data processing inequality -RRB- . finally , from what i have been reading lately , it seems that this is hopeless : just the fact of having an infinite measure space seems to break down all nice properties of the discrete entropy . however , i want to keep this question open to further comments from people with more acquaintance with information theory .
let <m> X </m> be a compact metric space , and consider the banach space <m> \Omega = C ( X , \mathbb R ) </m> of continuous , real-valued functions on <m> X </m> , equipped with the supremum norm . let <m> \delta _ x \in \Omega ^ * </m> be the evaluation functional , defined by <m> \delta _ x ( f ) = f ( x ) </m> . for any compact <m> D \subseteq X </m> , consider the <m> \sigma </m> - algebra <m> \mathcal F _ D = \bigcap _ { \epsilon > 0 } \sigma \{ \delta _ x : x \in D ^ \epsilon \} , </m> where <m> D ^ \epsilon </m> denotes the <m> \epsilon </m> - enlargement of the set <m> D </m> in <m> X </m> . loosely speaking , the <m> \sigma </m> - algebra <m> \mathcal F _ D </m> encodes the information stored in -LRB- an infinitesimal neighborhood of -RRB- the set <m> D </m> . the family <m> \mathbb F _ 0 = \{ \mathcal F _ D \} </m> admits the obvious partial ordering -LRB- <m> \mathcal F _ D \preceq \mathcal F _ { D ' } </m> if <m> D \subseteq D ' </m> -RRB- , and moreover is a lattice . it is also a partially-ordered , right-continuous filtration . question 1 : what is the general structure of the family <m> \mathbb F _ 0 </m> ? question 2 : what is the general structure of the space <m> \mathbb F </m> of all <m> \sigma </m> - algebras over <m> \Omega </m> ? is this space too big to have any nice structure ? is there a more appropriate space to call `` the space of <m> \sigma </m> - algebras '' ?
let <m> ( C _ 1 ) </m> , <m> ( C _ 2 ) </m> be two conics on the same ellipsoid , -LRB- or hyperboloid , or paraboloid -RRB- . let <m> A _ 1 , A _ 2 , A _ 3 , A _ 4 </m> be four arbitrary points lie on <m> ( C _ 1 ) </m> ; <m> B _ 1 </m> be arbitrary point on <m> ( C _ 2 ) </m> . the plane through <m> A _ i , B _ i , A _ { i + 1 } </m> meets <m> ( C _ 2 ) </m> again at <m> B _ { i + 1 } </m> for <m> i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 </m> . question : <m> B _ 5 \equiv B _ 1 </m> or <m> B _ 5 \ne B _ 1 </m> ?
why are there only trivial convergent sequences in the stone-Čech compactification of <m> \mathbb { N } </m> ?
a <m> \star </m> - ring is a ring with an involutive anti-automorphism . the simplest example of a noncommutative <m> \star </m> - ring is perhaps <m> B ( l ^ 2 ) </m> , the ring of bounded linear functions on the sequence space <m> l ^ 2 </m> . -LRB- this ring is in fact a c <m> \star </m> - algebra . -RRB- is there a characterization of the commutative <m> \star </m> - subrings of <m> B ( l ^ 2 ) </m> ?
this question is related to this one . let <m> G </m> be a real lie group -LRB- i should emphasize i only care about ordinary lie groups , not lie groups modeled on locally convex spaces or anything like that -RRB- . in the representation theory of <m> G </m> , one usually considers representations <m> G \to \mathrm { A u t } _ \mathbf { C } ( V ) </m> where <m> V </m> is a banach space and the map <m> G \times V \to V </m> is continuous , but in practice one also considers -LRB- at the very least -RRB- continuous representations on fréchet spaces like <m> C ^ \infty ( G ) </m> . the question referenced above is essentially about the definition of a <m> C ^ \infty </m> - vector in a continuous representation of <m> G </m> on a fréchet space . my interpretation of the answers given is that perhaps this is not completely standardized . however , on page 2 of the book continuous cohomology , discrete subgroups , and representations of reductive groups by borel and wallach , they introduce the notation <m> C ^ \infty ( M ; V ) </m> for `` the space of <m> C ^ \infty </m> functions of <m> M </m> , with values in <m> V </m> , endowed with the <m> C ^ \infty </m> - topology . '' here <m> M </m> is a smooth manifold which is `` countable at infinity '' -LRB- i 'm not sure what that means but i 'm sure i 'm happy to assume it for my lie group <m> G </m> , if it 's not automatic -RRB- and <m> V </m> is any hausdorff quasi-complete locally convex space over <m> \mathbf { R } </m> or <m> \mathbf { C } </m> . there is no explanation of this space 's definition , or of its topology , which leads me to believe -LRB- perhaps mistakenly -RRB- that this is something standard . -LRB- one would i think care about this for defining the notion of a <m> C ^ \infty </m> - vector in a general continuous representation of <m> G </m> on a locally convex space . -RRB- is the notion of a <m> C ^ \infty </m> - map from a smooth manifold to a hausdorff quasi-complete locally convex space over <m> \mathbf { R } </m> or <m> \mathbf { C } </m> , and of the -LRB- presumably locally convex -RRB- topology on the space of such functions , actually standard ? if so , is there a convenient reference where this generality is explained ? -LRB- i do n't think this appears in any bourbaki volume because i do n't think any of them really combine lie groups with tvs , although if there were such a volume , i do n't doubt that it would have the answer to my question . -RRB- whether or not one cares about such generality in practice is not really my motivation for asking the question -LRB- my efforts to thoroughly read borel-wallach have been mostly abortive and i honestly do n't know whether or not they use this beyond the case of <m> V </m> fréchet -RRB- . i 'm really curious about this because , in the case where <m> k </m> is a <m> p </m> - adic field , <m> M </m> is a paracompact locally <m> k </m> - analytic manifold , <m> V </m> is an arbitrary hausdorff locally convex space over a <m> p </m> - adic field , and smooth maps are replaced by locally analytic ones , spaces of functions and their topologies in this generality are both defined and genuinely important in practice -LRB- namely in the representation theory of locally <m> k </m> - analytic groups on <m> p </m> - adic locally convex spaces that are n't just banach spaces or even fréchet spaces -RRB- . but i 'm not sure that mimicking the definition in the non-archimedean case -LRB- which uses banach subspaces of <m> V </m> and the already-defined case of banach spaces -RRB- would really work in the case of smooth manifolds , because somehow defining smooth maps <m> M \to V </m> in extreme generality seems harder to me than defining -LRB- locally -RRB- analytic ones as there is no issue of second derivatives , etc. -LRB- this is perhaps supported by the wikipedia page on the gâteaux derivative , which contains the statement '' ... for gâteaux differentials ... there are several inequivalent ways to formulate their continuous differentiability . '' -RRB-
background let <m> C </m> be an -LRB- extensive -RRB- category . an object <m> X \in C </m> is called connected if the functor <m> H o m ( X , - ) : C \rightarrow S e t </m> preserves coproducts . given a category <m> C </m> , one can consider the category <m> F a m ( C ) </m> of set-indexed familiies of objects in <m> C </m> . formally , the objects are pairs <m> ( X , F ) </m> in which <m> X </m> is a set and <m> F : X \rightarrow C </m> is a functor and a map <m> ( X , F ) \rightarrow ( Y , G ) </m> is pair <m> ( f , g ) </m> where <m> f : X \rightarrow Y </m> is a function and <m> g : F \Rightarrow G \circ f </m> is a natural transformation . the connected objects of <m> F a m ( C ) </m> are precisely the singleton families , i.e pairs <m> ( X , F ) </m> where <m> X </m> is a one-element set . the notion of an object being connected should have a straightforward generalization to the <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - categorical case . more precisely , call an object <m> X </m> of an <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - category <m> C </m> connected if <m> H o m ( X , - ) : C \rightarrow G r p d _ { \infty } </m> preserves coproducts . additionally , <m> F a m ( C ) </m> also has an analogous construction for <m> C </m> an <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - category . instead of looking at set-indexed families , we consider families of objects indexed by <m> \infty </m> - groupoids . so the objects of <m> F a m ( C ) </m> are pairs <m> ( X , F ) </m> where <m> X </m> is an <m> \infty </m> - groupoid and <m> F : X \rightarrow C </m> is a functor . the morphisms are exactly the same as the 1-categorical case . question what are the connected objects of <m> F a m ( C ) </m> when <m> C </m> is an <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - category ? i think that this is the case when <m> X </m> is a connected <m> \infty </m> - groupoid .
the question is the title . for example , if we could show that <m> S </m> is finite , then this would entail that every large enough integer <m> n </m> is such that <m> \zeta ( 2 n + 1 ) </m> is irrational and that , under rh , almost all non-trivial zeros of <m> \zeta </m> have irrational imaginary part . has this question been studied ? any reference ? thank you in advance .
the game lucy has <m> 2 n </m> distinct white colored balls numbered <m> 1 </m> through <m> 2 n </m> . lucy picks <m> n </m> different balls in any way lucy likes , and paint them red . lucy then giftwrap all the balls so that it is impossible to tell its color without opening its wrapping . lucy does this before offering any of the balls to alice . alice would like to get one of the red balls . alice does n't know which balls are painted red . lucy will offer alice the balls one by one , starting from ball <m> 1 </m> , until ball <m> 2 n </m> . upon being offered each ball , alice may either take the ball or pass it . if alice takes the ball , alice open the wrapping . if it is red , alice takes it and the game ends -- otherwise , alice will continue to be offered the remaining balls -LRB- unless all balls has been offered -RRB- . if alice pass the ball , the ball remains wrapped and thus alice does not know the color of the ball , and alice will continue to be offered the remaining balls . note that it is possible for alice not to get any red ball -- for example , if alice choose not to take any ball . alice 's goal is to
let <m> \mathcal T = D ^ b ( \mathbb P ^ 1 ) </m> , the bounded derived category of <m> \mathbb P ^ 1 </m> over a field <m> k </m> . it is well known that <m> \mathcal T </m> admits a strong and full exceptional sequence <m> \{ \mathcal O , \mathcal O ( 1 ) \} </m> , such that <m> \mathrm { H o m } ( \mathcal O , \mathcal O ( 1 ) ) </m> is 2-dimensional over <m> k </m> . now , let <m> \mathcal T ' </m> be another triangulated category , and let <m> F , G : \mathcal T \to \mathcal T ' </m> be exact functors . write <m> i : \{ \mathcal O , \mathcal O ( 1 ) \} \hookrightarrow \mathcal T </m> for the inclusion functor . at least under some reasonable assumptions , i can prove that a natural tranformation <m> \varphi : F \circ i \to G \circ i </m> can be extended to a natural transformation <m> F \to G </m> -LRB- this is true when <m> F </m> and <m> G </m> are enhanceable to dg-functors , and the proof i know involves those enhancements -RRB- ; what if i try to extend a natural transformation defined on the full subcategory <m> \{ \mathcal O , \mathcal O ( 1 ) , C ( x _ 0 ) \} </m> , where <m> C ( x _ 0 ) </m> is the cone of the morphism <m> x _ 0 : \mathcal O \to \mathcal O ( 1 ) </m> ? formally : let <m> j : \{ \mathcal O , \mathcal O ( 1 ) , C ( x _ 0 ) \} \hookrightarrow \mathcal T </m> be the inclusion , and let <m> \varphi : F \circ j \to G \circ j </m> be a natural transformation . does an extension <m> \widetilde { \varphi } : F \to G </m> of <m> \varphi </m> -LRB- such that <m> \widetilde { \varphi } \circ j = \varphi </m> -RRB- exist ? how can i construct it ? if necessary , i can also assume that <m> F </m> and <m> G </m> come from dg-functors between suitable enhancements .
let <m> X </m> be a topological affine space over a complete base field <m> \mathbb S : = \mathbb C </m> , <m> \mathbb R </m> or <m> \mathbb Q _ p </m> . let <m> X ^ * </m> be the dual space of continuous affine functionals equipped with the weak - <m> * </m> topology . at this level of generality , what are the necessary properties that the weak - <m> * </m> topology must satisfy ? e.g. , locally convex , hausdorff , etc. here 's a trivial property . unlike the linear setting , the affine dual space contains a one-dimensional subspace of constant functionals <m> c ( x ) : = c </m> .
i am trying to see whether the pair <m> ( G L ( 2 , \mathbb { Q } ) ^ + , S L ( 2 , \mathbb { Z } ) ) </m> is amenable in the following sense : let <m> H </m> be a closed subgroup of a locally compact group <m> G </m> . the pair <m> ( G , H ) </m> is called amenable if it satisfies the fixed point property ; that is if <m> G </m> acts on a compact convex subset <m> Q </m> of a locally convex vector space as a group of affine transformations and there is a fixed point for the restriction of this action to <m> H </m> , then there is a fixed point for the action of <m> G </m> as well . we know that <m> G L ( 2 , \mathbb { Q } ) ^ + </m> -LRB- considered as a discrete group -RRB- can be written as the semidirect product <m> S L ( 2 , \mathbb { Q } ) \rtimes \mathbb { Q } ^ + </m> . so if we prove that the pair <m> ( S L ( 2 , \mathbb { Q } ) , S L ( 2 , \mathbb { Z } ) ) </m> is amenable then the amenability of the former pair follows . on the other hand , we know that the pair <m> ( S L ( 2 , \mathbb { R } ) , S L ( 2 , \mathbb { Z } ) ) </m> is amenable -LRB- it seems it is due to kazhdan -RRB- . but i do n't know how to conclude the amenability of <m> ( S L ( 2 , \mathbb { Q } ) , S L ( 2 , \mathbb { Z } ) ) </m> from this , because <m> S L ( 2 , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> is not a closed subgroup of <m> S L ( 2 , \mathbb { R } ) ) </m> .
suppose <m> \kappa </m> is a measurable cardinal and <m> j : V \to M </m> is the ultrapower by a normal measure on <m> \kappa </m> . let 's say , for instance , that <m> 2 ^ \kappa = \kappa ^ { + + } </m> -LRB- note that this assumption has consistency strength greater than just a measurable cardinal -RRB- . it is easy to see that <m> j ( \kappa ) </m> has size <m> \kappa ^ { + + } </m> in <m> V </m> . so the cofinality of <m> j ( \kappa ) </m> in <m> V </m> can be either <m> \kappa ^ + </m> or <m> \kappa ^ { + + } </m> -LRB- it can not be <m> \kappa </m> because <m> M </m> is closed under <m> \kappa </m> - sequences -RRB- . can each of these possibilities be realized in some model of set theory ? more generally , what can be said about the cofinality of <m> j ( \kappa ) </m> under various gch assumptions ? as asaf karagila notes in the comments below , we can reformulate the question to ask what are the possible cofinalities of the order <m> \kappa ^ \kappa / U </m> for a normal measure <m> U </m> on <m> \kappa </m> . this is equivalent because elements of <m> j ( \kappa ) </m> are precisely the equivalence classes of functions <m> f : \kappa \to \kappa </m> .
i have had some previous knowledge on evolution equations in a banach space of the form <m> u ' ( t ) = A u ( t ) , </m> where <m> A </m> generates some strongly continuous operator semigroup . now i am looking at a problem where randomness and dependence upon time are introduced to <m> A </m> . let <m> ( \Omega , \mathscr { F } , \mathbb { P } ) </m> be a probability space . let <m> X </m> be a banach space . for each <m> \omega </m> in <m> \Omega </m> and each time <m> t </m> , let <m> A ( \omega , t ) </m> be a linear operator on <m> X </m> that is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup . for each <m> \omega </m> in <m> \Omega </m> , we have a linear evolution equation <m> u _ { \omega } ' ( t ) = A ( \omega , t ) u _ \omega ( t ) , \ u _ \omega ( 0 ) = u _ 0 </m> where <m> u _ 0 </m> in <m> X </m> is deterministic . -LRB- and for the problem to make sense , let us assume that <m> u _ 0 </m> is in the domain <m> D ( A ( \omega , 0 ) ) </m> for every <m> \omega </m> in <m> \Omega </m> . -RRB- i would like to learn about the more general problem , though in my specific problem , <m> A ( \omega , t ) = A _ 0 + A _ 1 ( t ) + A _ 2 ( \omega ) , </m> where <m> A _ 0 </m> is fixed , <m> A _ 1 </m> depends on <m> t </m> but not on <m> \omega </m> and <m> A _ 2 </m> depends on <m> \omega </m> but not on <m> t </m> . surely such problem have been studied . does anyone know some good textbooks/lecture notes on this topic ? secondly , i have a more specific question . suppose there exists an interval <m> I </m> such that for each <m> \omega </m> , the solution <m> u _ \omega ( t ) </m> exists and is unique for all time <m> t </m> in <m> I </m> . then i may view the solutions <m> u _ \omega ( t ) </m> as a function <m> u : \Omega \rightarrow C ^ 1 ( I , X ) </m> that maps each <m> \omega </m> to the <m> C ^ 1 </m> path <m> ( t \mapsto u _ \omega ( t ) ) </m> in <m> X </m> . with some suitable norm , and hence a borel <m> \sigma </m> - algebra on <m> C ^ 1 ( I , X ) </m> , what can be said about the measurability of this function <m> u : \Omega \rightarrow C ^ 1 ( I , X ) </m> ?
assume we start with a ground model satifying gch . what are some proper forcing notions with fusion -LRB- satisfying axiom a but not countably closed -RRB- , which when iterated <m> \aleph _ 2 </m> times with countable support , preserve cardinals and make <m> \mathfrak { p } = \aleph _ 2 </m> ? does such a forcing even exist ? for example , the prototypical such forcing , if in the above we replace <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> with : <m> \mathfrak { b } </m> , we get laver forcing , <m> \mathfrak { d } </m> , we get miller forcing , <m> \mathfrak { c } </m> , we get sacks forcing , etc. thanks .
in voisin 's book `` hodge theory and complex algebriac geometry i '' , the proof of proposition 12.7 -LRB- page 296 -RRB- says that if <m> X </m> is projective , then every divisor <m> Z </m> homologous to <m> 0 </m> can be written as a sum of divisors with multiplicity <m> 1 </m> . why is it true ?
is any integer <m> n > 1 </m> the sum of a number of the form <m> 4 ^ k - k </m> <m> ( k = 0 , 1 , 2 \ldots </m> -RRB- and a positive squarefree number ? though such representations are very sparse , i conjecture that the answer is yes ! for any positive integer <m> n </m> , let <m> a ( n ) </m> be the number of nonnegative integers <m> k </m> with <m> n - ( 4 ^ k - k ) </m> positive and squarefree . the sequence <m> a ( 1 ) , a ( 2 ) , \ldots </m> is available from http://oeis.org/a304720 . note that <m> 1 \leqslant a ( n ) \leqslant 7 </m> for all <m> n = 2 , 3 , \ldots , 1 0 ^ 5 </m> . i have verified that <m> a ( n ) > 0 </m> for every <m> n = 2 , 3 , \ldots , 1 0 ^ { 1 0 } </m> . it is natural to look at those integers <m> n > 1 </m> with <m> a ( n ) = 1 </m> . i have found totally 112 such values below <m> 2 \times 1 0 ^ 9 </m> -LRB- cf. http://oeis.org/a304721 -RRB- , the last of which is <m> 1 8 0 1 9 6 9 2 7 </m> with <m> 1 8 0 1 9 6 9 2 7 = 4 ^ { 1 1 } - 1 1 + 2 \times 1 3 9 \times 2 2 7 \times 2 7 8 9 . </m> i guess that there are no other values of <m> n </m> with <m> a ( n ) = 1 </m> . i have some other similar questions . for example , i conjecture that any positive integer can be written as the sum of a fibonacci number and a positive odd squarefree number -LRB- cf. http://oeis.org/a304522 -RRB- . any comments are welcome !
let <m> F </m> be a local non-archimedean field and let <m> G </m> be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over <m> F </m> . let <m> G _ { d e r } </m> denote the algebraic derived group of <m> G </m> ; this is connected and semisimple . let <m> Z </m> be the center of <m> G </m> and let <m> Z ^ 0 </m> denote its algebraic connected component of the identity . then <m> G = Z ^ 0 G _ { d e r } </m> ; in fact the map <m> Z ^ 0 \times G _ { d e r } \to G </m> is a central isogeny . my questions arise from considering the restriction of complex representations of <m> G ( F ) </m> to <m> G _ { d e r } ( F ) </m> . we note that <m> Z ^ 0 \times G _ { d e r } </m> and <m> G </m> are connected and have isomorphic lie algebras .
let us consider <m> \beta \mathbb { N } </m> , the stone-Čech compactification of the natural numbers -LRB- where we do not take <m> 0 </m> to be a natural number , so the only idempotent elements are nonprincipal ultrafilters -RRB- , with the usual topology and the semigroup structure inherited -LRB- extended -RRB- from the naturals . also , let <m> \mathcal { C } </m> be the -LRB- topological -RRB- cantor set , and <m> \mathcal { C } ^ \mathcal { C } </m> be the space of all functions from <m> \mathcal { C } </m> to <m> \mathcal { C } </m> , endowed with the tychonoff product topology -LRB- or the topology of pointwise convergence -RRB- and the semigroup structure of composition of functions . do you know of any characterisation of the possible topological embeddings of <m> \beta \mathbb { N } </m> into <m> \mathcal { C } ^ \mathcal { C } </m> ? are there any concrete -LRB- and non-trivial -RRB- examples ? are any of these embeddings also homomorphisms ?
i recently came across this question : is the axiom of choice needed to prove the following statement : let <m> V , W </m> be vector spaces , and suppose <m> V \neq \{ 0 \} </m> . let <m> v \in V </m> , <m> v \neq 0 </m> , <m> w \in W </m> . there exists a linear map <m> T : V \rightarrow W </m> such that <m> T v = w </m> . i have talked to someone , who went and asked a few people , and they think that just zf by itself is not sufficient , and that we indeed do need ac . furthermore , they think that the statement is itself not sufficient to prove ac . can anyone give a definitive answer ?

hello ! it may be a stupid question , i 'm trying to find a closed form for an integral similar to a fourier transform on <m> S ^ { n } </m> but i 'm stuck ... let <m> \alpha > 0 </m> , the integral i ca n't solve is <m> I ( p , \alpha ) = \int _ { S ^ { n } } e ^ { i \alpha \left < p , q \right > } d \mu _ { S ^ { n } } ( q ) </m> where <m> p , q \in S ^ { n } </m> , <m> \left < \cdot , \cdot \right > </m> is the euclidean scalar product on <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { n + 1 } </m> and <m> d \mu _ { S ^ { n } } </m> is the measure induced by euclidean measure on <m> \mathbb { R } ^ { n + 1 } </m> . so the question is : is there a closed form for <m> I ( p , \alpha ) </m> only in terms of <m> p </m> and <m> \alpha </m> ? thank you in advance !

cayley 's formula states that the number of labeled trees on <m> n </m> vertices is <m> n ^ { n - 2 } </m> . my question is : is there a generalization of this formula for forests ? let <m> f _ { n , k } </m> denote the number of forests with <m> k </m> connected components on <m> n </m> vertices . for example , <m> f _ { n , 1 } = n ^ { n - 2 } </m> by cayley 's formula and <m> f _ { n , n - 1 } = \binom { n } { 2 } </m> . is there a known closed formula for <m> f _ { n , k } </m> ? if not , is there an asymptotic formula ?
i am cross-posting this question which i posted in math.stackexchange.com since i realized that there are people in mathoverflow who are not signed-up there . edit : for a topological group <m> G </m> and a topological <m> G </m> - module <m> M </m> , we define the <m> n </m> th group of continuous cochains <m> C ^ n = C ^ n ( G , M ) </m> as the group of continuous maps <m> G ^ n \rightarrow M </m> . we define a coboundary map <m> d _ n : C ^ n \rightarrow C ^ { n + 1 } </m> by the formula : <m> ( d _ n f ) ( g _ 1 , \ldots , g _ { n + 1 } ) = g _ 1 f ( g _ 2 , \ldots , g _ { n + 1 } ) + \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ n ( - 1 ) ^ i f ( g _ 1 , \ldots , g _ i g _ { i + 1 } , \ldots , g _ { n + 1 } ) + ( - 1 ) ^ { n + 1 } f ( g _ 1 , \ldots , g _ n ) . </m> this yields a complex <m> C ^ { \bullet } ( G , M ) </m> . we define the <m> n </m> th cohomology group of <m> G </m> with coefficients in <m> M </m> by <m> H ^ n ( G , M ) : = \text { k e r } d _ n / \text { i m } d _ { n - 1 } </m> . now , let <m> K </m> be a finite extension of <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> and <m> K ^ s </m> a separable closure of <m> K </m> . put <m> G _ K : = G a l ( K ^ s / K ) </m> . let <m> V </m> be a finite-dimensional <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> - vector space with a continous action of <m> G _ K </m> given by <m> : G _ K \rightarrow G L ( V ) </m> . my question is : is there a difference between the cohomology groups <m> H ^ n ( G _ K , V ) </m> and <m> H ^ n ( G _ V , V ) </m> , where <m> G _ V = ( G _ K ) </m> ? i am guessing that if there is such a difference , it might have something to do with their respective topologies , -LRB- profinite topology on <m> G _ K </m> and <m> p </m> - adic topology on <m> G L ( V ) </m> -RRB- but i am not really sure .

let <m> G = \operatorname { G L } _ n ( F ) </m> for a <m> p </m> - adic field <m> F </m> , and let <m> G _ D = \operatorname { S L } _ n ( F ) </m> . i am wondering if there is a connection between irreducible , admissible representations of <m> G </m> and of <m> G _ D </m> . if <m> ( \pi , V ) </m> is one for <m> G </m> , then i am not sure whether the restriction of <m> \pi </m> to <m> G _ D </m> remains irreducible and admissible . on the other hand , if we begin with <m> ( \pi , V ) </m> as an irreducible admissible representation of <m> G _ D </m> , can we associate this to an irreducible admissible representation of <m> G </m> by some sort of procedure involving induced representations ? i would not expect <m> \operatorname { c - I n d } _ { G _ D } ^ G \pi = \operatorname { I n d } _ { G _ D } ^ G \pi </m> to hold in general , and <m> \operatorname { c - I n d } _ { G _ D } ^ G \pi </m> , though admissible , need not be irreducible . i would hope at best that there is some irreducible admissible subrepresentation <m> \sigma </m> of <m> \operatorname { c - I n d } _ { G _ D } ^ G \pi </m> for which <m> \sigma | _ { G _ D } \cong \pi </m> .
suppose we are given an embedding of <m> S ^ 2 </m> in <m> \mathbb { C P } ^ 2 </m> with self-intersection 1 . is there a diffeomorphism of <m> \mathbb { C P } ^ 2 </m> which takes the given sphere to a complex line ? note : i suspect that either it is known that there is such a diffeomorphism , or the problem is open . this is because if there was an embedding for which no such diffemorphism existed , you could use it to produce an exotic 4-sphere . to see this , reverse the orientation on <m> \mathbb { C P } ^ 2 </m> then blow down the sphere . edit : for a counter-example , it is tempting to look for the connect-sum of a line and a knotted <m> S ^ 2 </m> . the problem is to prove that the result can not be taken to a complex line . for example , the fundamental group of the complement <m> C </m> is no help , since it must be simply connected . this is because the boundary of a small neighbourhood <m> N </m> of the sphere is <m> S ^ 3 </m> and so <m> \mathbb { C P } ^ 2 </m> is the sum of <m> N </m> and <m> C </m> across <m> S ^ 3 </m> and so in particuar <m> C </m> must be simply-connected .
i want to know if there exists a closed formula for sum <m> A _ n ( X ) = \sum \limits _ { i = 0 } ^ n X ^ { i ^ 2 } </m> . i have found if n is odd then <m> ( X ^ n + 1 ) \text { | } A _ n ( X ) </m> , but i do n't have found a closed formula .
related to this question coefficients of <m> f ( t ) = ( \sum _ { m = 0 } ^ { + \infty } e ^ { 2 \pi i m ^ 4 t } ) ( \sum _ { m = 0 } ^ { + \infty } e ^ { 2 \pi i n m ^ 4 t } ) </m> i have the following question : what is the set of homogeneous polynomials <m> p ( x , y ) \in \mathbb { Z } [ x , y ] </m> wich induces injective function when viewed as polynomial functions <m> p : { \mathbb { N } } ^ 2 \to \mathbb { Z } </m> ?
question edited in view of the comments below by yamada 's paper we can conclude that if <m> n > e ^ { e ^ { 3 6 } } </m> be an even number then it can always be written as the sum of a prime and a semi-prime . my question is ,
if c is generic of genus 6 , then <m> \Theta _ { s i n g } </m> is a smooth surface . can anyone give me a reference or a hint as to what that surface might be . what are the numerical characteristics of this surface ? it has an involution . what is the quotient of this surface ? how is this surface related to the curve c ? i would ideally like information along the lines of the genus 5 case in which case <m> \Theta _ { s i n g } </m> is a double cover of a curve of genus 6 and the prym of this cover is the original c. in case it helps , the inverse image of <m> \Theta _ { s i n g } </m> in <m> \Sym ^ 5 ( C ) </m> is a 3 fold which is determinantal .
let 's define <m> N ( \alpha , T , \chi ) = \sharp \lbrace \rho = \sigma + i \gamma : L ( \rho , \chi ) = 0 , \alpha \leq \sigma < 1 , | \gamma | \leq T \rbrace </m> , where <m> \chi </m> is a primitive dirichlet character . we know , from gallagher 's paper , that <m> \sum _ { q \leq T } \sum _ { \chi \pmod { q } } N ( \alpha , T , \chi ) \ll T ^ { c ( 1 - \alpha ) } </m> for every <m> 0 \leq \alpha < 1 </m> with <m> c > 0 </m> an absolute costant . but what about an explicit value of such costant <m> c </m> ? i need some good and explicit estimate of the sum above . can anyone help me ?
does there exist an endomorphism of <m> ( \mathbb Z _ p , + ) </m> of finite order different of <m> x \mapsto \xi x </m> where <m> \xi </m> is a root of unity in <m> \mathbb Z _ p </m> ? thanks in advance
let <m> \mathsf C _ n </m> denotes the statement : for any family <m> \mathcal F </m> of <m> n </m> - element sets there exists a choice function -LRB- i.e. , a function <m> f : \mathcal F \to \bigcup \mathcal F </m> such that <m> f ( F ) \in F </m> for all <m> F \in \mathcal F </m> -RRB- . it is known that <m> \mathsf C _ 2 \Rightarrow \mathsf C _ 4 </m> in zf . this fact suggests introducing a partial preorder <m> \preceq </m> on the set <m> \mathbb N </m> of positive integers defined by <m> n \preceq m </m> if <m> \mathsf C _ m \Rightarrow \mathsf C _ n </m> in zf . also we can write that <m> n \cong m </m> if <m> \mathsf C _ n \Leftrightarrow \mathsf C _ m </m> . it is easy to show that <m> n \preceq m </m> if <m> n </m> divides <m> m </m> . so , <m> 1 \preceq n </m> for any <m> n \in \mathbb N </m> and <m> 2 \preceq n </m> for any even number <m> n </m> . on the other hand , <m> \mathsf C _ 2 \Rightarrow \mathsf C _ 4 </m> implies that <m> 2 \cong 4 </m> . what else is known about the partial preorder <m> \preceq </m> ? maybe there exists a precise -LRB- arithmetic -RRB- description of this preorder . a more specific question : is <m> 2 ^ n \cong 2 </m> for any <m> n \in \mathbb N </m> ? i know that similar questions were studied by mostowski , tarski , truss , jech so maybe the answer is already known ?
in the paper `` normal subgroups in the cremona group '' , it is stated that the induced isometry <m> f _ { \ast } </m> of <m> f \in J _ d </m> , where <m> J _ d </m> denote the set of jonquières transformations of degree <m> d </m> , satisfies the equation <m> f _ \ast [ H ] = d [ H ] - ( d - 1 ) [ E _ { p _ 0 } ] - \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 2 d - 2 } [ E _ { p _ i } ] </m> i understand the part where they say that <m> f </m> has a base point <m> p _ 0 </m> of multiplicity <m> d - 1 </m> and <m> 2 d - 2 </m> distinct points of multiplicity 1 each . however i do not understand how they derived the above action of <m> f _ \ast </m> on the line <m> [ H ] </m> lying in the -LRB- completed -RRB- picard-manin space . would be grateful if anyone points me in the correct direction ! thank you .
any symplectic manifold <m> ( M , \omega ) </m> carries a representation of <m> \frak { s l } _ 2 </m> : define the maps <m> L : \Omega ^ \bullet \to \Omega ^ { \bullet } , ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \Lambda : \Omega ^ \bullet \to \Omega ^ { \bullet } , ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ H : \Omega ^ \bullet \to \Omega ^ { \bullet } , </m> as follows <m> L ( \nu ) : = \omega \wedge \nu , ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \Lambda ( \nu ) : = \sum \omega _ { i j } ^ { - 1 } i _ { \partial _ i } i _ { \partial _ j } ( \nu ) , </m> where <m> i </m> denotes the interior product , and finally , for any <m> \mu \in \Omega ^ k </m> , we define <m> H ( \mu ) = ( n - k ) \mu . </m> this can be shown by direct calculation to satisfy <m> [ L , \Lambda ] = H , ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ [ L , H ] = 2 L , ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ [ \Lambda , H ] = - 2 \Lambda . </m> is there a conceptual , or at least non-computational , proof of this result that anyone can direct me to . also , i am happy to hear of more philosophical reasons for this to be true .
i would like to find some non-trivial and `` geometric '' examples of hermitian connections -LRB- that is compatible with a give hermitian metric -RRB- on complex hermitian vector bundles over a smooth real manifold . more specifically : let <m> M \subset \mathbb C ^ { n + 1 } </m> be a smooth real hypersurface and consider its real tangent bundle <m> T _ M ^ { \mathbb R } </m> and its complex tangent bundle <m> T _ M = T _ M ^ { \mathbb R } \cap i T _ M ^ { \mathbb R } </m> , where <m> i </m> is the imaginary unit in <m> \mathbb C ^ { n + 1 } </m> . let me call <m> g </m> the standard flat riemmanian metric on <m> \mathbb C ^ { n + 1 } \simeq \mathbb R ^ { 2 n + 2 } </m> and <m> h </m> the standard flat hermitian metric on <m> \mathbb C ^ { n + 1 } </m> -LRB- so that <m> g </m> is just the real part of <m> h </m> -RRB- . finally , let <m> \pi \colon T _ M ^ { \mathbb R } \to T _ M </m> be the orthogonal projection with respect to <m> g </m> . consider the levi-civita connection <m> \nabla _ M </m> on <m> T _ M ^ { \mathbb R } </m> with respect to -LRB- the restriction on <m> T _ M ^ { \mathbb R } </m> of -RRB- <m> g </m> and call <m> h _ M </m> the restriction of <m> h </m> to <m> T _ M </m> . then <m> ( T _ M , h _ M ) </m> is a complex hermitian vector bundle on the smooth real manifold <m> M </m> . next , set <m> D : = \pi \circ \nabla </m> . questions . is <m> D </m> a -LRB- complex -RRB- linear connection on <m> T _ M </m> ? if so , is it a hermitian connection with respect to <m> h _ M </m> ? is it true at least when <m> M = S ^ { 2 n + 1 } </m> is the unit sphere in <m> \mathbb C ^ { n + 1 } </m> ? thanks in advance !
suppose that we have a function <m> u </m> on <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 2 </m> such that <m> r \frac { \partial } { \partial \theta } u \in L ^ 2 ( \mathbb { R } ^ 2 ) </m> . suppose it is also given that <m> u </m> lies in some fractional sobolev space <m> H ^ s ( \mathbb { R } ^ 2 ) </m> for <m> 1 / 3 < s < 1 </m> . we also add the strong assumption about the differentiability of <m> u </m> about a second vector field : <m> \partial _ x u \in L ^ 2 </m> . my question is : can we use the first information somehow to get <m> u </m> to lie in a greater sobolev space , that is , <m> u \in H ^ { s ' } ( \mathbb { R } ^ 2 ) </m> where <m> s ' > s </m> ? for specificity , we can maybe use <m> s = 2 / 5 </m> or <m> s = 3 / 5 </m> , etc. we can also , if need be , assume that <m> u </m> is in schwartz space , or even compactly supported . any help will be highly appreciated . thanks . edit : after @bazin 's comment . my intention is to understand how to use the condition <m> r \frac { \partial } { \partial \theta } u \in L ^ 2 ( \mathbb { R } ^ 2 ) </m> because it seems a bit `` weak '' in the sense that it somehow can not control the behaviour near <m> 0 </m> . more edit : the way in which i say take <m> s = 2 / 5 </m> or <m> s = 3 / 5 </m> or say one can add assumptions in <m> u </m> might seem a bit lax , but just for clarification : i am more interested in learning some generic approaches/methods as opposed to solving this particular problem . i have observed that there are frequently situations where you have some conditions which are not enough to say <m> H ^ 1 </m> , but very nearly so . so if you have some reference in mind from where i can learn problems like these -LRB- please give the chapter number if you can , it is sometimes very difficult to find something from an entire book -RRB- , that will also be a very acceptable and welcome answer . i just hope the motivation is clear :-RRB-
hi everyone , let <m> A </m> be a pid , let <m> \mathfrak { m } </m> be a maximal ideal of <m> A [ X ] </m> . i would like to find a direct simple proof of that fact that <m> \mathfrak { m } \cap A \neq 0 </m> . for the moment , i only know to prove it using the following fact : if <m> I </m> is a prime ideal of <m> A [ X ] </m> such that <m> I \cap A = 0 </m> -LRB- <m> A </m> pid -RRB- , then one shows that <m> I = ( f ) </m> for some <m> f \in A [ X ] </m> . but one can see easily that <m> I </m> is never maximal in this case . however , it seems quite intricate . does anyone know a direct argument ? of course , the final goal is to prove that <m> \mathfrak { m } = ( \pi , f ) </m> , where <m> \pi \in A </m> is a prime element and <m> f </m> is irreducible modulo <m> \pi </m> , but it follows easily , once we know that <m> \mathfrak { m } \cap A \neq 0 </m> . thanks ! greg
in the category of <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - modules , there exists a module <m> A </m> -- for instance <m> \bigoplus _ { k = 2 } ^ \infty \mathbb { Z } / k \mathbb { Z } </m> -- such that a <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - module <m> B </m> is injective iff <m> \operatorname { E x t } ^ 1 _ \mathbb { Z } ( A , B ) = 0 </m> . does this hold if <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> is replaced with an arbitrary -LRB- unital -RRB- ring <m> R </m> ? if not , what are some sufficient conditions on <m> R </m> for this to hold ? as a comment , note that this is equivalent to requiring the existance of a family <m> \{ A _ j \} _ { j \in J } </m> of <m> R </m> - modules indexed by some set <m> J </m> such that an <m> R </m> - module <m> B </m> is injective iff <m> \operatorname { E x t } ^ 1 _ R ( A _ j , B ) = 0 </m> for all <m> j \in J </m> : this is clearly implied by the original statement . to get the other direction , set <m> A : = \bigoplus _ { j \in J } A _ j </m> . then <m> \operatorname { E x t } ^ 1 _ R ( A , B ) = \prod _ { j \in J } \operatorname { E x t } ^ 1 _ R ( A _ j , B ) = 0 </m> since each component is <m> 0 </m> .
consider the point <m> x = \langle \omega _ 1 , \omega \rangle </m> in the tychonov plank <m> ( \omega _ 1 + 1 ) \times ( \omega + 1 ) </m> . then there is essentially only one sequence -LRB- of length <m> \omega </m> -RRB- converging to it , namely <m> x _ n = \langle \omega _ 1 , n \rangle </m> for <m> n \in \omega </m> . indeed , any other sequence converging to <m> x </m> is eventually contained in <m> \{ x _ n : n \in \omega \} </m> . -LRB- for simplicity , the sequences are assumed not to contain <m> x </m> . -RRB- my question is : does this property -LRB- or any similar one -RRB- has a standard name ?
does koepke 's notion of ordinal computability admit an analogue of the kleene <m> T </m> - predicate ? if so , is the existence of such a <m> T </m> - predicate independent of <m> Z F C </m> ? also , if one assumes the existence of such a <m> T </m> - predicate , can an analogue of the kleene hierarchy be defined for koepke 's ordinal computability , and can one define a set theory based on that analogue of the kleene hierarchy rather than , say , the cumulative hierarchy ?
in -LRB- reference -RRB- the following result is attributed to kreisel : lemma1 -LRB- kreisel -RRB- if <m> T </m> is an <m> \omega </m> - consistent theory in the language of arithmetic and <m> \pi </m> is a true <m> \Pi _ 1 </m> sentence , then <m> T + \pi </m> is also <m> \omega </m> - consistent . my question is : question : if <m> T </m> is an <m> \omega </m> - consistent theory in the language of arithmetic , is <m> T + T h _ { \Pi _ 1 } ( \mathbb { N } ) </m> also <m> \omega </m> - consistent ? -LRB- <m> T h _ { \Pi _ 1 } ( \mathbb { N } ) </m> is the set of all true <m> \Pi _ 1 </m> sentences -RRB- . the best i could do is the following result : lemma2 -RRB- if <m> T \supset I \Sigma _ 1 </m> is an <m> \omega </m> - consistent theory in the language of arithmetic and <m> A </m> an r.e. subset of <m> T h _ { \Pi _ 1 } ( \mathbb { N } ) </m> , then <m> T + A </m> is also <m> \omega </m> - consistent . proof : if <m> T _ 1 = T + A </m> was <m> \omega </m> - inconsistent , then there was a sentence <m> \exists x \alpha ( x ) </m> such that <m> T + A \vdash \exists x \alpha ( x ) </m> and also <m> T + A \vdash \neg \alpha ( \overline { n } ) </m> -LRB- for all <m> n </m> -RRB- . let <m> A = \{ \pi _ { i } \} _ { i \in \mathbb { N } } </m> . by the compactness theorem , there are indexes <m> j _ { 1 } , \ldots , j _ { m } </m> such that : <m> T + \{ \pi _ { j _ { 1 } } , \ldots , \pi _ { j _ { m } } \} \vdash \exists x \alpha ( x ) </m> . it follows from conservation theorem -LRB- reference , theorem 5.2.1 -RRB- that <m> T + c o n ( T _ { 1 } ) \vdash \pi _ { i } </m> -LRB- for every <m> i \in \mathbb { N } </m> -RRB- . then <m> T + c o n ( T _ { 1 } ) \vdash \exists x \alpha ( x ) </m> , and by similar reason : <m> T + c o n ( T _ { 1 } ) \vdash \neg \alpha ( \overline { n } ) </m> -LRB- for every <m> n \in \mathbb { N } </m> -RRB- . then <m> T _ 1 = T + c o n ( T _ { 1 } ) </m> is an <m> \omega </m> - inconsistent theory and it contradicts the lemma1 .
let <m> \Omega \subset \mathbb { R } ^ N </m> be bounded domain with smooth boundary . the first eigenvalue of <m> - \Delta \colon W _ 0 ^ { 1 , 2 } ( \Omega ) \cap W ^ { 2 , 2 } ( \Omega ) \rightarrow L ^ 2 ( \Omega ) </m> is strictly positive . this is well known and proved by using the energy method . but i learned that <m> - \Delta </m> can be extended up to <m> L ^ 1 ( \Omega ) </m> . in this case , is the first eigenvalue still strictly positive ?
suppose <m> F ( x , y ) </m> is a polynomial in two variables over a field <m> K </m> , and <m> F ( x , y ) </m> is not a square . when is <m> F ( x , a ) </m> a square for <m> a \in K </m> ? i would guess that hilbert 's irreducibility theorem might help -LRB- if <m> K </m> is hilbertian -RRB- , but i am not sure how .
let us consider the points <m> p _ 1 = [ 1 : 0 : . . . : 0 ] , p _ 2 = [ 0 : 1 : . . . : 0 ] , . . . , p _ { n - 2 } = [ 0 : . . . : 0 : 1 ] , \, p _ { n - 1 } = [ 1 : 1 : . . . : 1 ] \in \mathbb { P } ^ { n - 3 } </m> and the blow-up <m> X = B l _ { p _ 1 , . . . , p _ { n - 1 } } \mathbb { P } ^ { n - 3 } </m> . furthermore , consider <m> p _ 1 = ( [ 0 : 1 ] , . . . , [ 0 : 1 ] ) , p _ 2 = ( [ 1 : 0 ] , . . . , [ 1 : 0 ] ) , p _ 3 = ( [ 1 : 1 ] , . . . , [ 1 : 1 ] ) \in ( \mathbb { P } ^ 1 ) ^ { n - 3 } </m> and the blow-up <m> Y = B l _ { p _ 1 , p _ 2 , p _ 3 } ( \mathbb { P } ^ 1 ) ^ { n - 3 } </m> . note that for the picard numbers we have <m> \rho ( X ) = n = \rho ( Y ) . </m> does there exist a small <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> - factorial transformation <m> f : X \dashrightarrow Y </m> ?
a subspace <m> Y </m> of <m> X </m> is said to be semi m-ideal if <m> \exists </m> a projection <m> P </m> -LRB- not necessarily linear -RRB- from <m> X ^ * </m> to <m> Y ^ \perp </m> such that <m> \| x ^ * \| = \| P x ^ * \| + \| x ^ * - P x ^ * \| </m> . and also , <m> P ( \lambda x ^ * + P y ^ * ) = \lambda P x ^ * + P y ^ * </m> , <m> \forall x ^ * , y ^ * \in X ^ * </m> . it is known that <m> k e r ( \mathbb { 1 } ) </m> as a subspace of <m> \ell _ 1 </m> is a semi m-ideal , where <m> \mathbb { 1 } \in \ell _ \infty </m> . my question is what is the corresponding projection <m> P : \ell _ \infty \to s p \{ \mathbb { 1 } \} </m> which satisfies above norm decomposition ?
let <m> S </m> be affine . a bit of background : let us think of <m> S </m> - group schemes as abelian sheaves over a given site -LRB- etale , zariski , fppf , etc -RRB- . when we take a cokernel of a morphism <m> \phi </m> this category : <m> A \xrightarrow { \phi } B \xrightarrow { \beta } B / \phi ( A ) </m> it will often be a presheaf , and we must sheafify it wrt the given site in order to obtain a sheaf . is there an example of a cokernel where -LRB- a -RRB- we must work over the fppf site for the sheafification of the cokernel to still give an exact sequence -LRB- and the sequence is not exact as sheaves when we sheafify over the etale or zariski site -RRB- and -LRB- b -RRB- does n't have <m> \mu _ d </m> as the kernel . the only examples satisfying -LRB- a -RRB- that i , and those around me , can come up with are the following :
let <m> \chi </m> denote the <m> p </m> - adic cyclotomic character . let <m> \mathbb { Q } ^ { c y c } </m> denote the cyclotomic <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> - extension of <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> . let <m> \gamma </m> be the topological generator of <m> \Gamma = \text { G a l } ( \mathbb { Q } ^ { c y c } / \mathbb { Q } ) </m> for which <m> \chi ( \gamma ) = 1 + p </m> . let <m> X </m> be a finitely generated torsion <m> \Lambda = \mathbb { Z } _ p [ \Gamma ] \simeq \mathbb { Z } _ p [ [ T ] ] </m> module with <m> \gamma </m> identified with <m> T + 1 </m> . suppose that i can show that <m> \frac { X } { ( T + 1 - \chi ^ k ( \gamma ) ) X } </m> is a free <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> module for all <m> k \equiv 1 \mod ( p - 1 ) </m> , does it follow that the <m> \mu </m> invariant of <m> X </m> is zero ? -LRB- the issue here is that a finite kernel in a pseudo-isomorphism causes problems -RRB- .
when i try to solve <m> F ( x , y ) = \Gamma ( x + c ) / \Gamma ( x + d ) y ^ d / y ^ c = { \rm c o n s t } </m> , i find that <m> y = p x + q </m> satisfies the above equation , whith specific <m> p </m> and <m> q </m> constants for the given constants <m> c </m> and <m> d </m> . c > 0 and d > 0 and c / = d. to see this numerically , i take the <m> x , y </m> for <m> 1 < x < 1 0 </m> , and <m> 1 0 < y < 1 0 0 0 </m> , draw contour plots for <m> F ( x , y ) </m> , when c = 4.2 and d = 1.8 . the contour plots show linear function <m> y = p x + q </m> . in other word , y = px + q has constant value of f -LRB- x , y -RRB- . however , i do not know how i can prove it mathematically . could you give some suggestions ? thanks !
let <m> c _ { 0 } \widehat { \otimes } _ { \pi } c _ { 0 } </m> be the projective tensor product of <m> c _ { 0 } </m> and <m> c _ { 0 } </m> . let <m> ( e _ { n } ) _ { n } </m> be the unit vector basis of <m> c _ { 0 } </m> . for each <m> n </m> , define <m> z _ { n } = e _ { n } \otimes \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { n } e _ { j } </m> . then the basic sequence <m> ( z _ { n } ) _ { n } </m> is sub-symmetric . my question : is each normalized block basic sequence of <m> ( z _ { n } ) _ { n } </m> equivalent to <m> ( z _ { n } ) _ { n } </m> ? thank you .
i asked this question here on math.se but uptil now it was not answered . so i decided to give it a try . thank you in advance . working in <m> \mathbf { Z F } </m> let <m> R </m> be a proper class of ordered pairs that is well-founded . this means that for every non-empty set <m> a </m> there is a set <m> b \in a </m> such that <m> c R b \implies c \notin a </m> . here <m> c R b </m> is a notation for <m> \langle c , b \rangle \in R </m> and <m> b </m> is a so-called <m> R </m> - minimal element of <m> a </m> . if <m> R </m> is local -LRB- i.e. collections <m> \{ x \mid x R b \} </m> are all sets -RRB- then it can be shown that also non-empty proper classes have <m> R </m> - minimal elements . i encountered a proof that made the condition of being local redundant . it made use of an operation on classes that adds to each class a set that is contained in it -LRB- bottom-operation -RRB- but the definition of this operation relied on the regularity axiom . my question :
let <m> A \to B </m> be a map of commutative rings , and <m> d : B \to I / I ^ 2 </m> be defined by <m> d f = f \otimes 1 - 1 \otimes f </m> , where <m> I </m> is the kernel of <m> B \otimes _ A B \to B </m> , as in -LSB- hartshorne ii .8 -RSB- .
i found an inequality as following : let <m> x , y , z </m> be three complex numbers then : <m> \frac { 1 } { 2 } ( | y + z - x | + | x + z - y | + | y + x - z | ) \le | x | + | y | + | z | + \frac { 1 } { 2 } | x + y + z | </m> -LRB- 1 -RRB- the inequality holds with equality if and only if <m> x + y + z = 0 </m> note that : i have a proof of the inequality -LRB- 1 -RRB- .
is there an example of simple and non-nuclear -LRB- non-amenable -RRB- <m> C ^ * </m> - algebra ?
let <m> S </m> be an <m> L </m> shaped region in the unit cube <m> Q : = [ 0 , 1 ] \times [ 0 , 1 ] </m> : <m> S : = Q \backslash C , \quad C : = \left [ \frac 1 2 , 1 \right ] \times \left [ \frac 1 2 , 1 \right ] . </m> consider the multiplier operator <m> T </m> defined by <m> \widehat { T f } ( \xi ) : = \hat f ( \xi ) 1 _ { S } ( \xi ) </m> then what can we say about the operator norm of <m> T </m> on <m> L ^ p ( \mathbb R ^ 2 ) </m> , where <m> 1 < p < \infty </m> ? we have the following observations :

this is totally elementary , but i have no idea how to solve it : let <m> A </m> be an abelian group such that <m> A </m> is isomorphic to <m> A ^ 3 </m> . is then <m> A </m> isomorphic to <m> A ^ 2 </m> ? probably no , but how construct a counterexample ? you can also ask this in other categories as well , for example rings . if you restrict to boolean rings , the question becomes a topological one which makes you think about fractals : let <m> X </m> be stone space such that <m> X \cong X + X + X </m> , does it follow that <m> X \cong X + X </m> -LRB- here + means disjoint union -RRB- ? edit : in the answers there are already counterexamples . but you may add others in other categories -LRB- with products/coproducts -RRB- , especially if they are easy to understand :-RRB- .
suppose matrices <m> a </m> and <m> b </m> generate <m> M _ n ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> . i would like to know what restrictions this imposes on <m> a </m> and <m> b </m> . more concretely , do there exist <m> a , b \in M _ n ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> , which generate <m> M _ n ( \mathbb { C } ) </m> , such that the minimal polynomial of <m> \alpha a + \beta b </m> has degree <m> \leq n - 1 </m> for all <m> \alpha , \beta \in \mathbb { C } </m> ?
suppose we have an invertible matrix q in a finite subgroup <m> Q </m> of <m> G l ( n , \mathbb Z ) </m> , the group of all invertible integer matrices . now i want to find all <m> x \; m o d \; \mathbb Z ^ n </m> for which <m> ( q + q ^ 2 + q ^ 3 + . . . + q ^ m ) . x = 0 \quad m o d \; \mathbb Z ^ n </m> where <m> m </m> is the order of <m> q </m> in the finite subgroup <m> Q </m> of <m> G l ( n , \mathbb Z ) </m> so that <m> q ^ m = 1 </m> . i tried using the smith normal form so that <m> ( q + q ^ 2 + q ^ 3 + . . . + q ^ m ) = U . D . V </m> where <m> U , V </m> in <m> G l ( n , \mathbb Z ) </m> and <m> D </m> the smith normal form , so we have to solve <m> D . V . x = 0 \quad m o d \; \mathbb Z ^ n </m> since <m> D . V </m> is diagonal , <m> x </m> must have rational components unless the diagonal element is zero . now my question is , what is the maximal denominator of the components in <m> x </m> ? so what is the maximal absolute value in <m> D . V </m> ? i think this must be <m> m </m> , but i ca n't figure out why . edit : let me clarify why i expect x to be rational with an upper bound on the denominator . suppose g is a subgroup of the euclidean group with isometries -LRB- t , q -RRB- as elements -LRB- t : translational part , q : linear part -RRB- . the subgroup t which contains all isometries in g with trivial linear part is a normal subgroup of g. suppose now that t can be identified with a <m> \mathbb Z </m> - lattice in <m> \mathbb R ^ n </m> , then g/t is isomorph with a finite subgroup q of <m> G L ( n , \mathbb Z ) </m> . crystallographers call g a space group and q a point group . there are only finite many conjugacy classes of finite subgroups in <m> G L ( n , \mathbb Z ) </m> , so there are only finite many point groups up to conjugacy in <m> G L ( n , \mathbb Z ) </m> . now i want to understand why from this finite number of point groups , a finite number of -LRB- non-equivalent -RRB- space groups can be deduced . if we write g as the union of cosets of t <m> G = \bigcup _ { i = 1 } ^ { | Q | } ( t _ { q i } , q _ { i } ) T </m> we see that -LRB- composition of two isometries and q belongs to exactly one coset -RRB- <m> t _ { q _ 1 . q _ 2 } = t _ { q _ 1 } + q _ 1 . t _ { q _ 2 } \quad m o d \ \mathbb Z ^ n </m> so we know that <m> t _ { q } </m> is a real vector <m> 0 \leq t _ { q } < 1 </m> . using the previous property we also find that -LRB- m order of q -RRB- <m> ( t _ { q } , q ) ^ { m } = ( q ^ { 1 } \cdot t _ { q } + \cdots + q ^ { m } \cdot t _ { q } , q ^ m ) \in ( 0 , i d ) T </m> <m> \Leftrightarrow ( q ^ { 1 } + \cdots + q ^ { m } ) \cdot t _ { q } = 0 \quad m o d \ \mathbb { Z } ^ { n } </m> if an appropriate origin is chosen in euclidean space , <m> t _ { q } </m> should be rational with maximal denominator <m> m </m> . maybe investigating <m> ( t _ { q } , q ) ^ { m } </m> is not the best way to find bounds on <m> t _ { q } </m> ?
let <m> d \ge 1 </m> . do there exist gaussian random fields on <m> \mathbb R ^ d </m> which are -LRB- almost surely -RRB- <m> C ^ { \infty } </m> - smooth , but which are not analytic ? if so , what are necessary and sufficient conditions on the covariance function to assure that the field is -LRB- a.s. -RRB- <m> C ^ { \infty } </m> - smooth ?
let <m> f ( x ) </m> be an irreducible integral polynomial with degree <m> \text { d e g } [ f ] </m> . if <m> p | f ( x ) </m> for some <m> x </m> , then denote by <m> S ( p ) </m> the smallest positive number <m> x _ 0 </m> such that <m> p | f ( x _ 0 ) </m> . do there exist infinitely many primes <m> p </m> such that <m> S ( p ) < c p ^ { \frac { 2 } { \text { d e g } [ f ] } } \, , </m> for some constant <m> 0 < c < 0 . 5 </m> ? what happens if we replace <m> 2 </m> by another constant <m> d </m> ?
this question arise from the comparision of the reconstruction theorems of bondal-orlov and balmer and is inspired by shizhuo zhang 's mathoverflow question : how to unify various reconstruction theorems -LRB- gabriel-rosenberg , tannaka , balmers -RRB- on the one hand , a. bondal and d. orlov in http://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9712029 proved their celebrated reconstruction theorem : let <m> X </m> be a smooth projective variety such that the canonical bundle <m> \omega _ X </m> is either ample or anti-ample , and let <m> Y </m> be any projective variety . if <m> D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) \cong D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( Y ) </m> as triangulated categories , then <m> X \cong Y </m> . in fact , they reconstruct <m> X </m> from <m> D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) </m> and their construction heavily use the <m> \textit { S e r r e f u n c t o r } </m> s. in general , for a <m> k </m> - linear category <m> \mathcal { C } </m> , an equivalence <m> S : \mathcal { C } \rightarrow \mathcal { C } </m> is called a serre functor for <m> \mathcal { C } </m> if their is a natural , bifunctorial isomorphisms <m> \varphi _ { A , B } : \text { H o m } _ { \mathcal { C } } ( A , B ) \xrightarrow { \sim } \text { H o m } _ { \mathcal { C } } ( B , S A ) ^ { \vee } </m> for every <m> A , B </m> . here <m> ( \bullet ) ^ \vee </m> denotes the <m> k </m> - dual . when <m> \mathcal { C } = D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) </m> , the serre functor <m> S _ X </m> is given by <m> S _ X \mathcal { E } = \mathcal { E } \otimes \omega _ X [ \dim X ] </m> i.e tensor product with the canonical bundle and shift by <m> \dim X </m> in <m> D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) </m> . we can refer to section 4 of a. caldararu 's lecture notes http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0501094 for an excellent introduction . we notice that bondal-orlov reconstruction does not involve the tensor structure of <m> D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) </m> besides the definition of the serre functor . -LRB- as pointed out by piotr and qiaochu in the comments , the serre functor is unique , hence is part of the data of <m> D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) </m> and is not an extra data . -RRB- on the other hand , p. balmer in http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0111049 proved another reconstruction theorem : let <m> X </m> be a noetherian scheme , then we can reconstruct <m> X </m> from the <m> \textit { t e n s o r t r i a n g u l a t e d c a t e g o r y } </m> <m> ( D ^ { \text { p e r f } } ( X ) , \otimes ^ L _ { \mathcal { O } _ X } ) </m> . this reconstruction uses the extra structure of <m> D ^ { \text { p e r f } } ( X ) </m> : the tensor product , and it applies for more general <m> X </m> than bondal-orlov . now we can look at the case when the two theorems overlap : if <m> X </m> is smooth projective with <m> \omega _ X </m> ample or anti-ample , then <m> D ^ { \text { p e r f } } ( X ) \cong D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) </m> . now from <m> D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) </m> either using the serre functor or using the tensor structure . it seems that there are some redundancy here . in fact we have <m> D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) \xrightarrow [ \text { r e c o n s t r u c t i o n } ] { \text { B o n d a l - O r l o v } } X \rightarrow ( D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) , \otimes ^ L _ { \mathcal { O } _ X } ) \xrightarrow [ \text { r e c o n s t r u c t i o n } ] { \text { B a l m e r } } X \rightarrow D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) \ldots </m> hence one may expect a direct construction of the tensor structure <m> ( D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) , \otimes ^ L _ { \mathcal { O } _ X } ) </m> just from <m> D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) </m> itself , considered as a triangulated category . <m> \textbf { M y q u e s t i o n } </m> is : if <m> X </m> is smooth projective variety with <m> \omega _ X </m> ample or anti-ample , could we define the tensor product structure on <m> D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) </m> just from the triangulated cateogry structure on <m> D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) </m> ? in the other direction we have <m> \textbf { a r e l a t e d q u e s t i o n } </m> : what is the role of the serre functor <m> S _ X </m> and the canonical bundle <m> \omega _ X </m> in the the tensor triangulated category <m> ( D ^ b _ { \text { c o h } } ( X ) , \otimes ^ L _ { \mathcal { O } _ X } ) </m> ?

i 'm doing a research about filippov systems on <m> \mathbb { S } ^ 3 </m> with discontinuities on <m> \displaystyle \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 2 } } \cdot \mathbb { T ^ 2 } = \left \{ \displaystyle \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 2 } } x ; \ x \in \mathbb { S } ^ 1 \times \mathbb { S } ^ 1 \subset \mathbb { R } ^ 4 \right \} </m> . briefly , we define the function <m> h : \mathbb { S } ^ 3 \to \mathbb { R } </m> , <m> h ( x _ 1 , x _ 2 , x _ 3 , x _ 4 ) = x _ 1 ^ 2 + x _ 2 ^ 2 - 1 / 2 , </m> and given two smooth fields <m> X , Y </m> on <m> \mathbb { T } ^ 2 </m> , we try to or understand the behavior of solutions of the differential inclusion <m> \dot { x } \in F ( x ) = \left \{ \begin {array} { l l } X ( x ) & \mbox { i f } h ( x ) > 0 , \\ Y ( x ) & \mbox { i f } h ( x ) < 0 , \\ \text { C o n v } [ X ( x ) , Y ( x ) ] & \mbox { i f } h ( x ) = 0 , \end {array} \right . </m> where <m> \text { C o n v } [ X ( p ) , Y ( p ) ] = \left \{ \frac { 1 + \lambda } { 2 } X ( p ) + \frac { 1 - \lambda } { 2 } Y ( p ) ; \ \lambda \in [ - 1 , 1 ] \right \} . </m> i.e ; understand the behavior of the functions <m> \varphi : I \to \mathbb { T } ^ 2 ; </m> such that <m> \varphi </m> is absoute continous and <m> \varphi ' ( t ) \in F ( \varphi ( t ) ) </m> for almost every <m> t </m> <m> \in </m> <m> I </m> . at one point , i faced the following question that i 've been having problems to solve / finding papers or books that have this type of result
i want to know when an elliptic curve <m> E \rightarrow S </m> is a quotient of <m> \mathbb { G } _ a </m> . when <m> S </m> is an analytic space , there is an exact sequence <m> 0 \rightarrow R ^ 1 \mathbb { Z } ^ { \vee } \rightarrow e ^ { * } \omega _ { E / S } ^ { \vee } \cong \mathbb { G } _ a \rightarrow E \rightarrow 0 </m> -LRB- even for abelian schemes -RRB- . however , for a general scheme <m> S </m> , i think this can not be true in general . if the exponential map is surjective -LRB- i do n't know when this is true -RRB- , there would be some exact sequence . would it -LRB- the kernel -RRB- be some kind of lattice ? in the <m> p </m> - adic case , though , i think some version would be reasonable . is there a generalization for <m> S </m> not over the complex numbers ? any references or explanations on how to construct this kind of uniformization ? thanks in advance
let stable matrix -LRB- i.e. , its eigenvalues have negative real parts -RRB- <m> B \in \mathbb R ^ { n \times n } </m> and anti-symmetric matrix <m> T \in \mathbb R ^ { n \times n } </m> satisfy <m> B ^ \top - T B ^ \top = B + B T </m>
let <m> \bar { H } _ { g , n } </m> be the moduli space -LRB- or moduli stack -RRB- of <m> n </m> - pointed stable hyperelliptic curves . i am interested in understanding its rational picard group . in the case <m> n = 0 </m> , the rational picard group is generated by the irreducible components of the boundary <m> \partial \bar { H } _ { g , n } </m> , and these are linearly independent . the boundary components are obtained by intersecting those of <m> \bar { M } _ { g , n } </m> with <m> \bar { H } _ { g , n } </m> , all but one components remain irreducible . the way this is proved is by considering maps from the ausiliary moduli of admissible double covers . one then proves that they are linearly independent , for example this is done in geometry of algebraic curves ii , page 391 -LRB- thm 8.4 -RRB- . all of this i think i understand well . has the analogous procedure been carried out somewhere for <m> n > 0 </m> ? i am having trouble generalizing the definition of admissible covers to <m> n </m> - pointed admissible covers . for example , if i take them to be <m> ( \pi : C \to D , p _ 1 , \dots , p _ n \in C </m> not in the ramification locus of <m> \pi </m> , <m> ( D , \pi ( p _ i ) , B ) </m> stable , where <m> B </m> is the branch divisor of <m> \pi </m> -RRB- then after contraction i do n't get those hyperelliptic stable marked curves such that the involution is ramified at the markings .
i 'd like to know a notion for a morphism between algebraic varieties in characteristic <m> p </m> that plays the role of a <m> C ^ { \infty } </m> - fiber bundle . it should be , in particular , flat . i 'm not assuming the morphism to be smooth ; e.g. a family of nodal curves <m> X _ t </m> with <m> p _ a = 2 </m> and such that the <m> j </m> - invariant of the normalizations <m> \widetilde { X } _ t </m> is not constant in <m> t , </m> would certainly qualify . motivation : if <m> f : X \to Y </m> is a proper morphism of complex algebraic varieties , then by morse theory , there exists a `` stratification of <m> f " ; </m> in particular , over each stratum of <m> Y , \ f </m> is a <m> C ^ { \infty } </m> - fiber bundle . i wonder if this could be true in char . <m> p , </m> but the first thing is to have an analogous notion .
suppose there exist functions <m> f , g , h </m> such that <m> h ( z ) = g ( f ( z ) ) </m> . if <m> f </m> and <m> h </m> are non-constant holomorphic function on domains in <m> \mathbb C ^ n , \, n > 1 </m> , then is <m> g </m> holomorphic ? we also assume that domain of <m> g </m> is same as range of <m> f </m> as otherwise one could define <m> g </m> to be anything outside the range of <m> f </m> to break the analyticity . for the case <m> n = 1 </m> , this is indeed true , however most proofs that i found -LRB- e.g https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/206652/if-composition-of-one-function-and-the-other-holomorphic-function-is-holomorphic -RRB- relies on one variable techniques ! it seems that the problem could be reduced to asking the same at the image of critical points of <m> f </m> . it would be really nice to have some references .
let <m> N </m> be an integer <m> \geq 3 </m> and <m> X ( N ) \rightarrow \mathrm { S p e c } \mathbb { Z } [ 1 / N ] </m> is the projective smooth modular curve defined in deligne-rappoport . is there an exemple of <m> N </m> for which the special fibre <m> X _ { \mathbb { F } _ p } ( N ) </m> of <m> X ( N ) </m> at some prime <m> p \nmid N </m> is isomorphic to the projective <m> \mathbb { P } ^ { 1 } _ { \mathbb { F } _ p } </m> ? another question : is there some technics to compute the genus of <m> X _ { \mathbb { F } _ p } ( N ) </m> ?
let <m> A </m> be a von neumann algebra acting on a hilbert space <m> H </m> , and suppose that <m> \Omega \in H </m> is a cyclic and separating vector for <m> A </m> . then in tomita-takesaki theory one defines an unbounded operator <m> S </m> to be the closure of the operator <m> a \triangleright \Omega \mapsto a ^ { * } \triangleright \Omega . </m> it then turns out that if we consider the polar decomposition <m> S = J \Delta ^ { 1 / 2 } </m> into an anti-linear unitary involution <m> J </m> and an unbounded positive operator <m> \Delta ^ { 1 / 2 } </m> it follows that the map <m> A \ni a \mapsto J a ^ { * } J \in ( A ' ) ^ { \operatorname { o p p } } </m> is an isomorphism . -LRB- here the superscript opp stands for opposite algebra . -RRB- now , let <m> A </m> be any von neumann algebra , then a standard form for <m> A </m> is a quadruple <m> ( A , H , J , P ) </m> , where <m> H </m> is a hilbert space in which <m> A </m> acts , <m> J </m> is an antilinear operator in <m> H </m> , and <m> P </m> is a self-dual cone , which satisfy the following properties .
let <m> V \subset H </m> be a dense and compact embedding . let <m> \lVert u _ n \rVert _ { L ^ \infty ( 0 , T ; H ) } + \lVert u _ n \rVert _ { L ^ 2 ( 0 , T ; V ) } < C </m> where <m> C </m> is independent of <m> n </m> . it follows that eg . <m> u _ n \rightharpoonup u </m> in <m> L ^ 2 ( 0 , T ; V ) </m> and <m> u _ n \rightharpoonup ^ * u </m> in <m> L ^ \infty ( 0 , T ; H ) </m> for some <m> u </m> .
is anything like <m> \dfrac n { \phi ( n ) } < \dfrac { \sigma ( n ) } n < e ^ \gamma \log \log n </m> known/conjectured for the generalizations of these functions ? let <m> n = p _ 1 ^ { a _ 1 } \cdots p _ t ^ { a _ t } </m> be the canonical prime factorization of <m> n </m> . combining these bounds we get the well-known inequality , <m> \dfrac { \phi ( n ) \sigma ( n ) } { n ^ 2 } < 1 </m> , but from the definitions <m> J _ k ( n ) = \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ t \left ( p _ i ^ { k a _ i } - p _ i ^ { k ( a - 1 ) } \right ) </m> and <m> \sigma _ k ( n ) = \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ t \dfrac { p _ i ^ { k ( a _ i + 1 ) } - 1 } { p _ i ^ k - 1 } </m> it 's clear that <m> \dfrac { J _ k ( n ) \sigma _ k ( n ) } { n ^ { 2 k } } = \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ t \left ( 1 - p _ i ^ { - k ( a _ i + 1 ) } \right ) < 1 </m> are any other good pairs of upper bounds for <m> J _ k ( n ) </m> and <m> \sigma _ k ( n ) </m> known for <m> k \ne 1 </m> of a form similar to those for <m> k = 1 </m> ? edit : i figure we should have something like <m> \dfrac { n ^ k } { J _ k ( n ) } < \dfrac { \sigma _ k ( n ) } { n ^ k } < B _ k ( n ) </m> , where <m> B _ k ( n ) </m> is the upper bound in question . as in the case <m> k = 1 </m> , it may be known for the totient function , but not for the divisor function .
consider the <m> L ^ p </m> estimate of the laplacian on a compact boundaryless riemannian manifold , suppose that <m> - \Delta _ g e _ { \lambda } = \lambda ^ 2 e _ \lambda ( x ) , x \in M </m> . c.d. sogge proved that we have the following <m> \| e _ { \lambda } \| _ { L ^ p ( M ) } \leq C \lambda ^ { ( \frac { 1 } { 2 } - \frac { 1 } { p } ) } \| e _ { \lambda } \| _ { L ^ 2 ( M ) } , \quad 2 \leq p \leq 6 , \, \| e _ { \lambda } \| _ { L ^ p ( M ) } \leq C \lambda ^ { 2 ( \frac { 1 } { 2 } - \frac { 1 } { p } ) - \frac { 1 } { 2 } } \| e _ { \lambda } \| _ { L ^ 2 ( M ) } , \quad 6 \leq p \leq \infty . </m> such estimates are sharp because for the round sphere <m> S ^ 2 </m> , the first one is sharp because of the highest weight spherical harmonics and the second one is sharp due to the zonal functions on <m> S ^ 2 </m> . a natural question is if we can get improved estimates under some additional assumption , indeed , if the manifold is everywhere nonpositive , then again sogge can show that , when <m> 2 < p < 6 </m> , the above bound can improve to be <m> o ( \lambda ^ { ( \frac { 1 } { 2 } - \frac { 1 } { p } ) } ) </m> , but the endpoint case <m> p = 6 </m> is not known , however , it 's valid for the standard torus <m> \mathbb T ^ 2 </m> due to a result by zygmund who showed that one has <m> \frac { \| e _ { \lambda } \| _ { L ^ 4 ( \mathbb T ^ 2 ) } } { \| e _ { \lambda } \| _ { L ^ 2 ( \mathbb T ^ 2 ) } } = o ( 1 ) </m> and interpolation with <m> p = \infty </m> my question is that why is it hard to prove the improved bound for <m> p = 6 </m> in general -LRB- with nonpositive curvature -RRB- ? the improved bound is of interested since one of its application can lead to the better lower bounds of the measure of the nodal sets , which is still open for the <m> C ^ \infty </m> case .

hi guys !! i 'm new in this forum . i have a simple question for you . let <m> k </m> an algebraically closed field . consider <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 \times \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> and <m> T _ { \mathbb { P } ^ 1 \times \mathbb { P } ^ 1 } </m> the tangent sheaf . how can i prove that <m> \dim _ k \Gamma ( \mathbb { P } ^ 1 \times \mathbb { P } ^ 1 , T _ { \mathbb { P } ^ 1 \times \mathbb { P } ^ 1 } ) = 6 </m> ??? good ... i 'm so stupid ... it 's enough observe that <m> \Omega _ { A \otimes _ R B / R } \cong A \otimes \Omega _ { B / R } \oplus \Omega _ { A / R } \otimes B </m> . then dualize this and use the euler sequence for <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m>
suppose <m> K </m> is an extension of <m> \mathbb { Q } _ { 2 } </m> -LRB- i could ask this for any <m> p </m> , but i 'm especially interested in <m> p = 2 </m> -RRB- which contains the hilbert class field -LRB- i.e. , maximal unramified extension -RRB- of <m> \mathbb { Q } _ { 2 } </m> and also contains all roots of unity -LRB- including <m> 2 </m> - power ones ! -RRB- then does <m> K </m> contain all roots of all elements of <m> \mathcal { O } _ { K } ^ { \times } </m> ? this seems to boil down to knowing the ramification behavior of extensions obtained by adjoining roots of units in <m> \mathcal { O } _ { K } ^ { \times } </m> . i feel like this should be hidden somewhere in the main results of class field theory , but i 'm not sure .

-LRB- this is an extension and specification of a question which i initially asked in mse having now one comment -LRB- which i could not yet digest completely -RRB- and which i also detailed further -LRB- after working on it much -RRB- so that i think this is a better place here -RRB- initially out of idle curiosity i considered whether on a -LRB- small -RRB- circle with radius <m> | \varepsilon | </m> around a nontrivial root -LRB- where <m> \zeta ( \rho ) = 0 + 0 </m> -RRB- is also a point with <m> \zeta ( \rho + \varepsilon ) = a + a </m> with some <m> a </m> - with the simple background that the same condition -LRB- the real part is equal to the imaginary part -RRB- holds also on the root . in extension of this i speculated , whether there might be even continuous lines of arguments <m> \rho + \varepsilon </m> with increasing distance to <m> \rho </m> , all with the same ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the zeta at this points ; and that those lines -LRB- `` isogones '' or `` isogonals '' -RRB- should cross the root because the real and imaginary part both being zero is compatible with any proportion/ratio . in mse daniel fischer gave an initial small comment that such lines actually exist , but i 'm now interested in a more intuitive and possibly more general argument for the basic idea and then for the generalizations of the subsequent observations which i 've seen when i played with this problem numerically . assume a circle with small radius <m> r </m> around some zero of the zeta . let <m> w _ \varphi </m> denote some point on this circle :

the torus <m> \mathbb { T } ^ n </m> , the sphere <m> \mathbb { S } ^ n </m> and the hyperbolic space <m> \mathbb { H } ^ n </m> admit metrics of constant -LRB- sectional -RRB- curvature <m> 0 , 1 , - 1 </m> respectively . do they afford metrics of constant curvature in <m> \{ 0 , 1 , - 1 \} </m> for a different value ? -LRB- e.g. does the torus admit a metric of curvature <m> - 1 </m> , or <m> 1 </m> ? -RRB- in the 2-dimensional case , the gauss-bonnet theorem answers the question negatively , but what about higher dimensions ?

consider <m> ( \mathbb { C } ^ 2 , \omega ) </m> where <m> \omega </m> is a non-degenerate complex skew-symmetric bilinear form on <m> \mathbb { C } ^ 2 </m> . let us write <m> V = ( \mathbb { C } ^ 2 , \omega ) </m> there are many spaces one can construct from <m> V </m> . for instance <m> S y m ^ n ( V ) </m> is a vector space endowed with a non-degenerate complex bilinear form -LRB- respectively a non-degenerate complex skew-symmetric bilinear form -RRB- if n is even -LRB- respectively odd -RRB- . thus , we have realized <m> O ( 2 k + 1 , \mathbb { C } ) </m> and <m> S p ( 2 k , \mathbb { C } ) </m> as groups of symmetry of a natural space constructed from <m> V </m> . a more complicated example is <m> G _ 2 </m> , which is the group of symmetries of <m> S y m ^ 6 ( \mathbb { C } ^ 2 ) </m> , endowed with a complex skew-symmetric trilinear form which can be defined using <m> \omega </m> only . see for instance theorem 1.1 -LRB- page 2 -RRB- in https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.2813 , though i am sure it goes back way before -LRB- not sure who is the first -RRB- . i am still struggling to get <m> O ( 2 n , \mathbb { C } ) </m> that way , as the group of symmetries of a natural space constructed from <m> V </m> , and i wonder whether the remaining exceptional lie groups can be viewed this way . i remark that there are more complicated spaces one can build from <m> V </m> , such as the kernel of the `` symmetrization map '' : <m> S y m ^ k ( \mathbb { C } ^ 2 ) \otimes S y m ^ l ( \mathbb { C } ^ 2 ) \to S y m ^ { k + l } ( \mathbb { C } ^ 2 ) </m> or , the kernel of : <m> S y m ^ k ( \mathbb { C } ^ 2 ) \otimes S y m ^ l ( \mathbb { C } ^ 2 ) \to S y m ^ { k - l } ( \mathbb { C } ^ 2 ) </m> if <m> k \geq l </m> , the map being defined by contracting using the symplectic form <m> \omega </m> . -LRB- i believe that the right term for `` natural space constructed from <m> V </m> '' is a schur functor , a term i have just met in one of prof. robert bryant 's answers to another post -RRB- .

if we denote the parabolic subgroup of <m> S L ( 2 , \mathbb { C } ) </m> by <m> P </m> , then we have the well known isomorphism <m> S L ( 2 , \mathbb { C } ) / P \simeq S ^ 2 </m> , where <m> S ^ 2 </m> is the two sphere . now the compact real form of <m> S L ( 2 , \mathbb { C } ) </m> is given by <m> S U ( 2 , \mathbb { C } ) </m> , and it gives us the alternative presentation <m> S U ( 2 , \mathbb { C } ) / S ^ 1 \simeq S ^ 2 </m> , where <m> S ^ 1 </m> is the circle group . what i would like to know is whether one has a similar description of <m> S ^ 2 </m> using <m> S L ( 2 , \mathbb { R } ) </m> the split real form of <m> S L ( 2 , \mathbb { C } ) </m> , i.e does there exist a subgroup <m> L \subset S L ( 2 , \mathbb { R } ) </m> , such that <m> S L ( 2 , \mathbb { R } ) / L \simeq S ^ 2 </m> , and if so , what is <m> L </m> ? moreover , is this description of <m> S ^ 2 </m> -LRB- if it exists -RRB- an affine variety ?

i am studying the construction of the motivic stable homotopy category of schemes <m> \mathbf { S H } ( S ) </m> following riou 's paper categorie homotopiquement stable d'un site suspendu avec intervalle -LRB- click to see the paper -RRB- and i have a problem due to my weakness in homotopy theory . riou proves that <m> \mathbf { S H } ( S ) </m> is a triangulated category out of a result of quillen in his book homotopical algebra . the result riou uses is the following -LRB- cf. corollaire 3.4 in riou 's paper -RRB- corollary 3.4 : let <m> C </m> be a pointed model category and let <m> H </m> be its homotopy category . assume that the suspension functor <m> \Sigma \colon H \rightarrow H </m> is an autoquivalence of categories . then <m> H </m> is a triangulated category . riou then proves that <m> \mathbf { S H } ( S ) </m> is a triangulated category in the following result -LRB- i state it for the case of the stable homotopy category of schemes -RRB- : theorem 3.10 : recall there is an isomorphism <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 \simeq S ^ 1 \wedge \mathbb { G } _ m </m> in <m> H _ \bullet ( S ) </m> . then the functor <m> \underline { \phantom { a } } \wedge S ^ 1 \colon \mathbf { S p t } ^ { \mathbb { P } ^ 1 } \to \mathbf { S p t } ^ { \mathbb { P } ^ 1 } </m> induces an equivalence of categories <m> \mathbf { S H } ( S ) \rightarrow \mathbf { S H } ( S ) </m> . the category <m> \mathbf { S H } ( S ) </m> is therefore canonically triangulated . lemma 3.11 : if the suspension functor <m> \mathbf { S H } ^ { S ^ 1 } ( S ) </m> is an equivalence of categories then so is the suspension in <m> \mathbf { S H } ^ { S ^ 1 \wedge \mathbb { G } _ m } ( S ) = \mathbf { S H } ( S ) </m> . he assumes that the suspension functor in <m> \mathbf { S H } </m> is <m> \underline { \phantom { a } } \wedge \mathbb { P } ^ 1 \colon \mathbf { S p t } ^ { \mathbb { P } ^ 1 } \to \mathbf { S p t } ^ { \mathbb { P } ^ 1 } </m> . my question is the following : question : quillen 's suspension on a model category <m> C </m> is a very concrete one he defines in terms of the model structure -LRB- cf. i. 2 theorem 2 of homotopical algebra -RRB- it is natural to expect that the suspension on <m> \mathbf { S H } </m> is <m> \underline { \phantom { a } } \wedge \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> . but : why is quillen suspension functor <m> \underline { \phantom { a } } \wedge \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> in <m> \mathbf { S H } ( S ) </m> ? how does one prove such a thing ? thank you very much in advance for your time and help .
i understand the work in cohen and lenstra 's paper that leads up to the heuristics themselves , where they count weighted averages of functions defined over isomorphism classes of <m> A </m> - modules , where <m> A </m> is a number ring . when they get to the heuristics themselves , they start by saying : `` let <m> \Gamma </m> be an abelian group of order <m> N </m> and <m> r _ 1 , r _ 2 </m> chosen such that <m> r _ 1 + 2 r _ 2 = N </m> . finally we let <m> A = A _ { \Gamma } </m> be the maximal order in the ring <m> \mathbb { Q } [ \Gamma ] / \sum _ { g \in \Gamma } g </m> . it is well known that <m> A _ { \Gamma } </m> is unique and that it is a product of rings of integers of number fields '' . i do n't really understand their notation . is this supposed to be a quotient of the group ring <m> \mathbb { Q } [ \Gamma ] </m> ? also , what do they mean by `` maximal order '' ? is n't an order just a subring of a number ring ? and for a number ring <m> \mathcal { O } </m> , <m> \mathcal { O } </m> itself is the maximal order contained in <m> \mathcal { O } </m> . but <m> \mathbb { Q } [ \Gamma ] / \sum _ { g \in \Gamma } g </m> is not a number ring ? finally , what is the intuition behind the ring <m> A _ { \Gamma } </m> ? i assume it is supposed to be related in some way to an abelian extension of <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> with galois group <m> \Gamma </m> .
what is the closed form of <m> \sum _ { k = 0 } ^ n \frac { x ^ k } { k ! } </m> as a function of <m> x </m> and <m> n </m> ? knowing that it converges to <m> e ^ x </m> when <m> n \to \infty </m> .
an uncountably categorical theory always has a strongly minimal set definable over its prime model , but sometimes this set needs parameters to define . by a <m> \varnothing </m> - definable imaginary i mean the quotient of some finite power of the home sort by a <m> \varnothing </m> - definable equivalence relation . no added generality is gained by considering quotients of definable sets , since we can always just extend the equivalence relation and send everything in the complement to a single point . every example of an uncountably categorical theory i can think of has a <m> \varnothing </m> - definable strongly minimal imaginary . so the question is :
let <m> K </m> be a finite field , and <m> \overline { K } </m> its algebraic closure . it is well known that two curves are isomorphic over <m> \overline { K } </m> if and only if they have the same <m> j </m> - invariant . if two such curves are also <m> K </m> - isogenous , i believe we can conclude that they are <m> K </m> - isomorphic , but i can not find any reference or elementary proof of this fact ; is it easy to see , or does anyone have a reference ? -LRB- it seems that this result is implicitly used in the algorithms for isogeny graphs of elliptic curves , like kohel 's , where the isogenous curves are encoded by there <m> j </m> - invariant -RRB- . as a side question , given a <m> j \in K </m> , how many curves over <m> K </m> have this <m> j </m> - invariant , up to <m> K </m> - isomorphisms ? for example , a -LRB- non-supersingular -RRB- curve and its quadratic twist both have the same <m> j </m> - invariant , but are not <m> K </m> - isogenous , so not <m> K </m> - isomorphic , so we have at least two <m> K </m> - isomorphism classes ; is this it ?
this is some sort of `` follow-up '' to the -LRB- unanswered -RRB- question posted here . let 's denote <m> \varphi : O ( 2 n ) \rightarrow O ( 2 n ) ; A \mapsto d e t ( A ) \cdot A . </m> then <m> \varphi </m> is an automorphism of <m> O ( 2 n ) </m> , and as is shown in the above link , when <m> n </m> is even , <m> H ^ 2 ( B \varphi ; Z / 2 ) : H ^ 2 ( B O ( 4 k ) ; Z / 2 ) \rightarrow H ^ 2 ( B O ( 4 k ) ; Z / 2 ) </m> switches the classes <m> w _ 2 </m> and <m> w _ 2 + w _ 1 ^ 2 </m> . since the extension <m> Z / 2 \rightarrow P i n ^ { - } ( 4 k ) \rightarrow O ( 4 k ) </m> is classified by the class <m> w _ 2 </m> and <m> Z / 2 \rightarrow P i n ^ { + } ( 4 k ) \rightarrow O ( 4 k ) </m> is classified by the class <m> w _ 2 + w _ 1 ^ 2 </m> c.f. introduction of kirby , taylor , `` a calculation of pin ^ -LCB- + -RCB- bordism groupos '' comment . math . helvetici 65 -LRB- 1990 -RRB- 434-447 , we conclude that <m> \varphi </m> pulls back the one extension to the other . in particular , as lie groups <m> P i n ^ + ( 4 k ) </m> and <m> P i n ^ - ( 4 k ) </m> are isomorphic . now my questions are :

a fairly ubiquitous object in elementary calculus is a function of the shape <m> r = f ( \theta ) </m> , where <m> r </m> is the radius and <m> \theta </m> the argument . common examples include the cardiod and limacon , and of course the circle can also be expressed this way . i understand the value of the substitution <m> x = r \cos ( \theta ) , y = r \sin ( \theta ) </m> since this helps with understanding complex variables , and when doing contour integration helps immensely . but i do n't recall in my entire undergraduate career , did i ever encounter a function of the shape <m> r = f ( \theta ) </m> past the examples shown in first year calculus . are these objects of any importance to any mathematically related field ? if so , what are they ? if not , then why are these objects still so dominant in the curriculum ? i understand one ` application ' is arc length computation , which in cartesian coordinates is notoriously difficult -LRB- to do exactly -RRB- . for instance , the arc length of <m> y = \sin ( x ) </m> say is ` difficult ' since <m> \sqrt { 1 + \cos ^ 2 ( x ) } </m> has no anti-derivative in elementary functions . if we have <m> r = f ( \theta ) </m> then the integral to be computed looks something like <m> \displaystyle \int _ { \alpha } ^ \beta f ( \theta ) d \theta </m> , which is fairly straightforward . but this ` application ' does n't really simplify things in practice , since a relationship of the form <m> r = f ( \theta ) </m> itself is rare and difficult to obtain , and numerical methods can give us practical ways to compute arc length anyway . any insight would be appreciated .
let <m> S p </m> be a suitably nice model of a suitably nice category of spectra . by this i mean that <m> S p </m> is a symmetric monoidal closed stable model category , where we can make sense of homotopy `` groups '' and so on . i 'm not sure how to formalise this , but i 'm thinking about the cases where <m> H o ( S p ) </m> is the classical stable homotopy category , or the <m> G </m> - equivariant stable homotopy category for some -LRB- finite -RRB- group <m> G , </m> or the morel-voevodsky <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 1 </m> - stable category of <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 1 </m> - spectra over a perfect field . now let <m> A </m> be a commutative ring object in <m> S p . </m> then by general theory the category <m> A - M o d </m> of module objects in <m> S p </m> over <m> A </m> has essentially the same formal properties as <m> S p . </m> however one notion which i have not seen established for <m> A - M o d </m> is that of a <m> t </m> - structure . so question does the category <m> A - M o d </m> admit a -LRB- nice -RRB- <m> t </m> - structure ? is this written down anywhere ? in a bit more detail : the category <m> H o ( S p ) </m> affords a <m> t </m> - structure . let 's concentrate on the <m> G </m> - equivariant case , <m> G </m> finite , since this seems to be middle ground in difficulty between ordinary stable homotopy and motivic stable homotopy . we can define homotopy presheaves <m> \underline \pi _ n : H o ( G - S p ) \to F u n ( \mathcal { O } , A b ) , </m> where <m> \mathcal { O } </m> is just the subcategory of <m> H o ( G - S p ) </m> consisting of the suspensions of <m> G / H _ + </m> for subgroups <m> H </m> of <m> G . </m> one proves that <m> ( G / H _ + ) </m> generate <m> H o ( G - S p ) </m> and so the functors <m> \underline \pi _ * </m> form a conservative system . we tentatively put <m> H o ( G - S p ) ^ { \le 0 } = \{ X | \underline \pi _ n ( X ) = 0 \text { i f } n > 0 \} </m> and similarly for <m> H o ( G - S p ) ^ { \ge 0 } . </m> unless i 'm mistaken one can prove this specifies a <m> t </m> - structure . namely we can use the fact that the sphere spectrum is connective to kill off homotopy groups using cones -LRB- and homotopy colimits i guess -RRB- thus giving one of the truncation functors , and the rest should follow . one may moreover prove that <m> H o ( G - S p ) ^ { \ge 0 } </m> is generated under homotopy colimits and extensions by <m> \mathcal { O } . </m> in particular the smash product of connective spectra is connective . so here is a more refined question : let <m> A </m> be a connective commutative highly structured ring spectrum in the <m> G </m> - equivariant stable homotopy category , for <m> G </m> a finite group . do <m> H o ( A - M o d ) ^ { \ge 0 } = \{ X : \underline \pi _ n ( X ) = 0 \text { f o r } n < 0 \} </m> and <m> H o ( A - M o d ) ^ { \le 0 } = \dots </m> specify a <m> t </m> - structure on <m> H o ( A - M o d ) </m> ? is the derived smash product over <m> A </m> right -LRB- t - -RRB- exact ? a more philosophical question to end : it seems to me that if this is true , it should be rather formal and so valid in much greater generality . what is the natural setting of such an observation , and where can i learn about it ?
sorry if this sounds like a silly reference request , but i was n't able to track down any . i 'm looking for proof , via forcing , that axiom of choice can fail in a model of <m> Z F </m> . all of papers i found where either proving something more sophisticated or , if it was some introductory paper/book , it showed that <m> \neg C H </m> is consistent relative to <m> Z F C </m> . again , sorry if this question sounds silly , but i would appreciate any help ! thanks in advance !
does the deligne-mumford space -LRB- without ordering for marked points -RRB- <m> \bar M _ { g , n } / S _ { n } </m> has fundamental chain in signular simplicial chains ? -LRB- because i read costello 's paper gw potential to tcft , as a orbifold , what 's the fundamental chain ? -RRB-

it is well-known that the set of nonnegative integers <m> \mathbb { N } </m> is definable in the ring of integers <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> . indeed , by lagrange 's four squares theorem we have <m> \mathbb { N } = \{ n \in \mathbb { Z } : \varphi ( n ) \} </m> , where <m> \varphi </m> is the formula <m> \varphi ( x ) : = \exists a \, \exists b \, \exists c \, \exists d \; x = a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 + c ^ 2 + d ^ 2 </m> however , lagrange 's theorem is not so trivial , so i wonder : is there a more elementary and self-contained proof of the definability of <m> \mathbb { N } </m> in the ring of integers ? thank you .
let <m> n , k </m> be positive integers . what is the smallest value of <m> N </m> such that for any <m> N </m> vectors -LRB- may be repeated -RRB- in <m> ( \mathbb Z / ( n ) ) ^ k </m> , one can pick <m> n </m> vectors whose sum is <m> 0 </m> ? my guess is <m> N = 2 ^ k ( n - 1 ) + 1 </m> . it is certainly sharp : one can pick our set to be <m> n - 1 </m> copies of the set <m> ( a _ 1 , . . . , a _ k ) </m> , with each <m> a _ i = 0 </m> or <m> 1 </m> . the case <m> k = 1 </m> is some math competition question -LRB- i think , but ca n't remember the exact reference -RRB- . does anyone know of some references ? thanks .
for example , consider the following <m> \lim _ { T \rightarrow \infty } \frac { 1 } { ( 2 T ) ^ 2 } \int ^ T _ { - T } \int ^ T _ { - T } \big [ \cos ( v / a ) - \cos ( u / b ) \big ] \cos ( \sqrt { u ^ 2 + v ^ 2 } ) \ d u \ d v , </m> where <m> a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = 1 </m> and <m> a , b > 0 </m> . the periodicity in the radial direction only coincides with that in the cartesian directions along four rays -LRB- which incidentally make the integrand vanish -RRB- . is the limit therefore nonexistent ? would any choice of the shape of integration region or discretization of <m> T </m> allow the limit to exist as a function of <m> a </m> -LRB- and/or <m> b </m> -RRB- ? are there any references that address similar problems in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> ?
if <m> V </m> is a real vector space , then the complexification of <m> V </m> is formally defined as <m> V ^ { \mathbb { C } } = V \otimes _ { \mathbb { R } } \mathbb { C } </m> . is there an analogous complexification operation for a real <m> n </m> - dimensional riemannian manifold <m> ( M , g ) </m> ? idea : the notion of complexification exists for lie groups , so perhaps one can `` complexify '' a real riemannian manifold by realizing it as a lie group -LRB- or the quotient of one -RRB- . it seems that under complexification of a real manifold some additional information must be added to determine a complex structure .
is there any reference written in english for the proof of langlands conjecture for <m> G L _ n </m> over function fields ?
this question is motivated by my discussion -LRB- via comments -RRB- with @fedja regarding this earlier question . in any case the question is whether there is any concise characterization of finite dimensional subspaces of <m> L ^ 1 . </m> i found some papers by our own bill johnson on finite dimensional subspaces of <m> L ^ p </m> spaces , but they appear to -LRB- a -RRB- be for <m> p > 1 </m> and -LRB- b -RRB- use a lot of language hard to understand for us troglodytes . in the meantime , the question is very concrete : i give you a centrally symmetric convex body in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ d , </m> and i ask whether this is the unit ball of the sup norm of the linear combinations of some <m> d </m> functions <m> f _ 1 , \dots , f _ d . </m> edit as @fedor points out , i asked a different question from what i intended : i had meant to ask about <m> L ^ \infty , </m> but the answers to this are very interesting , so i will let it stand , and i guess will ask a different question to avoid -LRB- or increase -RRB- confusion .
problem . does a compact metric space of finite packing dimension admit an equi-hölder embedding into a hilbert space ? a map <m> f : X \to Y </m> between metric spaces <m> ( X , d _ X ) </m> , <m> ( Y , d _ Y ) </m> is called equi-hölder embedding if there are positive real constants <m> c , C , \alpha </m> such that <m> c \cdot d _ X ( x , y ) ^ \alpha \le d _ Y ( f ( x ) , f ( y ) ) \le C \cdot d _ X ( x , y ) ^ \alpha </m> for all <m> x , y \in X </m> . the packing dimension of a compact metric space <m> ( X , d ) </m> in the -LRB- finite or infinite -RRB- number <m> D i m ( X ) = \limsup _ { \varepsilon \to 0 } \frac { \ln N _ \varepsilon ( X ) } { \ln ( 1 / \varepsilon ) } , </m> where <m> N _ \varepsilon ( X ) </m> is the cardinality of the smallest cover of <m> X </m> by subsets of diameter <m> \le \varepsilon </m> . remark . by the assouad embedding theorem , a metric space <m> X </m> admits an equi-hölder embedding in a finite-dimensional hilbert space if and only if <m> X </m> is doubling . it can be shown that doubling metric spaces have finite packing dimension .
let <m> R </m> be a noetherian ring , and <m> B </m> a finite locally free <m> R </m> - algebra . since <m> B </m> is locally free , for every <m> b \in B </m> , multiplication by <m> b </m> gives an <m> R </m> - linear endomorphism of <m> B </m> as a locally free <m> R </m> - module . thus , we may consider its characteristic polynomial <m> P _ b ( T ) : = \text { d e t } ( T - b ) \in R [ T ] </m> ie , we cover spec <m> R </m> with open neighborhoods <m> U _ i </m> where <m> B </m> is free , and on each <m> U _ i </m> we pick a basis , compute the characteristic polynomial there , and using basis-invariance of the char poly , we glue them together to obtain the char poly '' <m> P _ b ( T ) : = \text { d e t } ( T - b ) </m> '' in <m> R [ T ] </m> . this construction seems so natural and yet so strange at the same time . in terms of algebraic geometry , what does this characteristic polynomial represent/tell you ? is there a good reference/book that discusses the properties of this characteristic polynomial in this setting ? -LRB- i 'm of course familiar with the situation where <m> R </m> is a field . i 'm just wondering what carries over from the field case to our case here -RRB- .

it is easy to show that <m> n </m> -LRB- mutually different -RRB- circles on the plane can have maximum <m> n ( n - 1 ) </m> intersection points . in our optimal graph drawing research we have encountered a counterpart of this result . for a natural number <m> n </m> let <m> c _ 3 ( n ) </m> denotes the maximum number of triple intersection points of <m> n </m> -LRB- mutually different -RRB- circles on the plane . -LRB- a point is a triple intersection point if in belongs to at least three circles of the family -RRB- . this problem looks natural and simple , so it should be already known . thus i tried to google for it . surprisingly , i found nothing , hence i decided to ask here for a reference . we can easily show that <m> c _ 3 ( n ) \le n ( n - 1 ) / 3 </m> , by counting intersection points -LRB- there are at most <m> n ( n - 1 ) </m> of them -RRB- taking into account their multiplicity -LRB- each triple intersection point needs at least there of them -RRB- and maybe the value of <m> c _ 3 ( n ) </m> is asymptotically close to this upper bound . but for our applications we are mainly interested in upper bounds for small values of <m> n \le 1 0 </m> . for instance , the following pictures combined with the above upper bound shows that <m> c _ 3 ( 5 ) = 6 </m> , <m> 8 \le c _ 3 ( 6 ) \le 1 0 </m> , and <m> 1 2 \le c _ 3 ( 7 ) \le 1 4 </m> .
all rings below are commutative with unity . if <m> R </m> has a.c.c. on radical ideals i.e. if <m> S p e c R </m> is noetherian under zariski topology , then so is <m> R [ X ] </m> , this is theorem 2.5 in the following paper by ohm and pendleton https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.dmj/1077377788 . my question is : if <m> R </m> satisfies a.c.c. on radical ideals , then is it true that so does <m> R [ [ X ] ] </m> ? if this is not true in general , is there any additional hypothesis on <m> R </m> that would force this ?
let <m> X </m> be a -LRB- let us say smooth to obscure any confusions i have between <m> H ( X ) </m> and <m> H _ c ( X ) </m> -RRB- algebraic variety defined over some subfield of <m> \mathbb { C } </m> . i have occasionally overheard the expression '' <m> H ^ * ( X ) </m> is hodge-tate '' used to mean something which , as far as i could tell from context , resembled one of the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- <m> H ^ * ( X ) </m> is generated by <m> ( p , p ) </m> classes , i.e. those in some intersection <m> W _ { 2 p } H ^ i ( X , \mathbb { Q } ) \cap F ^ p H ^ i ( X , \mathbb { C } ) </m> , where <m> W </m> and <m> F </m> are the weight and hodge filtrations from the mixed hodge structure . in particular were <m> X </m> smooth and proper , <m> H ^ * ( X ) = \bigoplus H ^ { p , p } ( X ) </m> . -LRB- 2 -RRB- spread <m> X </m> out as appropriate and reduce mod a good prime , then it is ` polynomial count ' , i.e. the number of points over <m> \mathbb { F } _ { p ^ n } </m> is a polynomial in <m> p ^ n </m> . -LRB- 3 -RRB- spread <m> X </m> out as appropriate and reduce mod a good prime , then all the eigenvalues of frobenius are powers of <m> p </m> . -LRB- 4 -RRB- the class of <m> X </m> in the grothendieck group of varieties is in <m> \mathbb { Z } [ \mathbb { A } ^ 1 ] </m> but when i searched for `` hodge-tate '' on google , i arrived at some description of `` hodge-tate numbers '' etc which seemed to have something to do with p-adic hodge theory and apply to any variety . anyway my question is as in the title ,
i am looking for information about the symplectic groups <m> S p _ { 2 m } ( 2 ) </m> as permutation group acting on quadratic forms . consider the block matrices <m> e = \begin {pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end {pmatrix} , \qquad f = \begin {pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ - 1 & 0 \end {pmatrix} = e - e ^ T </m> on the vector space <m> ( \mathbb { F } _ 2 ) ^ { 2 d } </m> equipped with the standard basis . consider the symmetric bilinear form <m> \phi ( u , v ) = u f v ^ T </m> , and let <m> \Omega </m> be the set of all quadratic forms <m> \theta ( u ) </m> such that <m> \phi ( u , v ) = \theta ( u + v ) - \theta ( u ) - \theta ( v ) . </m> in particular the quadratic form <m> \theta _ 0 ( u ) = u e u ^ T </m> is <m> \in \Omega </m> , and any other element of <m> \Omega </m> can be shown to be of the form <m> \theta _ a = \theta _ 0 ( u ) + \phi ( u , a ) . </m> now <m> S p _ { 2 m } ( 2 ) </m> acts on <m> \Omega </m> , and it turns out that the action splits in two distinct orbits <m> \Omega ^ + = \{ \theta _ a | \theta _ 0 ( a ) = 0 \} , \qquad \Omega ^ - = \{ \theta _ a | \theta _ 0 ( a ) = 1 \} , </m> of size respectively <m> 2 ^ { m - 1 } ( 2 ^ m + 1 ) </m> and <m> 2 ^ { m - 1 } ( 2 ^ m - 1 ) </m> . the group <m> S p _ { 2 m } ( 2 ) </m> acts <m> 2 </m> - transitively on each of these orbits , see chap . 7 of permutation groups -LRB- dixon , mortimer -RRB- for more details . question : what can be said of the action of these two sets ? here are two more specific questions : is the stabilizer of one point acting imprimitevely , for some block structure ? what are the orbits of a <m> 2 </m> - point stabilizer ? motivation : i am studing the galois groups of polynomials -LRB- trinomials -RRB- over function fields in characteristic <m> p </m> , which can be proven to be <m> 2 </m> - transitive . this was done by abhyankar , galois theory on the line in nonzero characteristic -LRB- 1996 -RRB- , which computed the galois group of many trinomials , and i think that his results can be extended to cover more cases . if i 'm wrong i will happen to have learned something about <m> 2 </m> - transitive groups . the <m> 2 </m> - transitive permutations groups are classified -LRB- affine groups , alternating/symmetric , projective , symplectic <m> S p _ { 2 m } ( 2 ) </m> , unitary <m> P G U _ 3 ( q ^ 3 ) </m> , suzuki <m> S z ( q ) </m> and ree <m> R ( q ) </m> , plus a few sporadic groups -RRB- . computing the local galois group at a ramified place it is possible to describe the action of a subgroup , the inertia subgroup , as a permutation group on the roots . this allows to rule out certain familes of <m> 2 </m> - transitive groups , and sometimes it is possible to determine completely the galois group . and the symplectic group at the moment is the family that i find more difficult to understand .
this question was asked on mathstackexchange here , but there was no answer , so i am asking it here . let <m> x _ 1 = 2 , \quad x _ { n + 1 } = { { x _ n ( x _ n + 1 ) } \over 2 } . </m> what can we say about the behavior of <m> x _ n \text { m o d } 2 </m> ? is there an exact formula for <m> x _ n \text { m o d } 2 </m> ?

i am looking for a reference/proof that shows that the morava <m> K </m> - theory spectra , <m> K ( n ) </m> are not <m> E _ { \infty } </m> ring spectra . i suspect that this should be a calculation but i ca n't quite get it right . thank you as always .
let <m> G _ 2 </m> denote the exceptional lie group <m> G _ 2 </m> as a <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> - algebraic group . suppose that is also given a matrix representation <m> \rho : G _ 2 \rightarrow S O ( 7 ) </m> . let <m> M </m> be a matrix with integral coefficients in the image of this representation . what would be an approach to prove that there is no <m> S </m> , with integral coefficients , in the image of this representation , such that <m> M = S ^ k </m> . my first attempt was to use jordan decomposition <m> M = M _ s \cdot M _ u </m> and reduce to the semi-simple case , but that did n't work . any help is welcome . thanks !
let <m> \Delta ( \kappa , \mu ) </m> be the statement : `` let <m> F </m> be a family of cardinality <m> \kappa </m> of sets of cardinality less than <m> \mu </m> . then there is a family <m> G \subset F </m> of cardinality <m> \kappa </m> and a set <m> r </m> such that <m> a \cap b = r </m> for every <m> a , b \in G </m> '' . we know that if <m> \kappa </m> is a regular cardinal and <m> \lambda ^ { < \mu } < \kappa </m> , for every <m> \lambda < \kappa </m> then <m> \Delta ( \kappa , \mu ) </m> holds . my question is :
the reading of -LRB- hopkins - -RRB- lurie 's on the classification of topological field theories -LRB- arxiv : 0905.0465 -RRB- suggests that a stronger version of the cobordism hypothesis should hold ; namely , that -LRB- under eventually suitable technical assumptions -RRB- , the inclusion of symmetric monoidal <m> ( \infty , n ) </m> - categories with duals into <m> ( \infty , n ) </m> - categories should have a left adjoint , the `` free symmetric monoidal <m> ( \infty , n ) </m> - category with duals on a given category <m> \mathcal { C } </m> '' , and that this free object should be given by a suitably <m> \mathcal { C } </m> - decorated <m> ( \infty , n ) </m> - cobordism <m> B o r d _ n ( \mathcal { C } ) </m> . this would be an higher dimensional generalization of joyal-street-reshetikhin-turaev decorated tangles . such an adjunction would in particular give a canonical symmetric monoidal duality preserving functor <m> Z : B o r d _ n ( \mathcal { C } ) \to \mathcal { C } </m> which seems to appear underneath the constructions in freed-hopkins-lurie-teleman 's topological quantum field theories from compact lie groups -LRB- arxiv : 0905.0731 -RRB- . yet , i 've been unable to find an explicit statement of this conjectured adjointness in the above mentioned papers , and my google searches for `` free symmetric monoidal n-category '' only produce documents in which this continues with `` generated by a single fully dualizable object '' , as in the original form of the cobordism hypothesis . is anyone aware of a formal statement or treatment of the cobordism hypothesis from the left adjoint point of view hinted to above ?
i 'm trying to understand and learn more about `` almost surely bounded '' markov chains on countable state spaces . i 'm looking for references where i can learn how to work with more complicated examples of the following phenomenon . the most simplified example is the markov chain on <m> \mathbb { N } </m> with transition probabilities <m> p _ { \rightarrow } ( n ) = 1 / ( 1 + n ) \qquad p _ \leftarrow ( n ) = n / ( 1 + n ) </m> i want to answer question about the stationary distribution like upper bounds for the probability of observing a large state . i think of this model as a spring : there is a constant force pushing to the right , and proportional force to the left . in this simple example things can be worked out with elementary probability . the actual problem is in <m> \mathbb { N } ^ n </m> with a finite number of transitions on each vertex , each with likelihoods . the likelihood to move out to infinity is constant and the likelihood to move back is proportional to the size of the state . i then want probabilities to stay in inside some polyhedron for long time . to be specific : what are good references for markov chains on <m> \mathbb { N } ^ n </m> whose transitions are given by a finite set <m> E \subset \mathbb { Z } ^ n </m> , with probabilities for each transition <m> e \in E </m> depending on the state <m> u \in \mathbb { N } ^ n </m> ?

the segre cubic primal <m> X \subset P ^ 4 </m> is the git quotient of 6 points on <m> P ^ 1 </m> . let <m> M _ { 0 , 6 } </m> the dm compactification of the moduli of 6-pointed rational curves . the segre primal <m> X </m> is a cubic 3-fold with ten double points and there exists a natural map <m> M _ { 0 , 6 } \to X </m> that contracts 10 boundary divisors -LRB- each iso to <m> P ^ 1 \times P ^ 1 </m> -RRB- to the singular points . now if i blow up the singular points of <m> X </m> , since they are ordinary double points , i get a <m> P ^ 1 \times P ^ 1 </m> exceptional divisor over each of them . call <m> \tilde { X } </m> the blown up variety . maybe it is a silly question , but it is clear that there exists an iso <m> \tilde { X } \cong M _ { 0 , 6 } </m> ? why ?
using the chinese remainder theorem , it is very straight forward to find a sequence of consecutive integers starting at <m> x </m> where each of the first <m> n </m> prime numbers is a least prime factor for a given number in the sequence and no number in the sequence has a least prime factor greater than <m> p _ n </m> . trivially , we know that this first occurs for the first <m> n </m> primes at <m> x = 2 </m> . for example , the first <m> 3 </m> primes are least prime factors in <m> 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 </m> each of these sequences can be characterized by the prime ordering of least prime factors which can be represented as <m> p _ 1 : p _ 2 : \cdots : p _ n </m> a sequence with the first <m> 4 </m> primes is trivially found at <m> x = 2 </m> in <m> 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 </m> . in this sequence , the prime ordering of the first occurrence of least prime factors is <m> 2 : 3 : 5 : 7 </m> . the second trivial occurrence is found at <m> x = 3 </m> since <m> 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 </m> shows the prime ordering <m> 3 : 2 : 5 : 7 </m> a third trivial occurrence is found at <m> x = 4 </m> since <m> 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 </m> shows the prime ordering <m> 2 : 5 : 7 : 3 </m> . i consider these sequences as `` trivial '' because for <m> n \ge 3 </m> , <m> 2 </m> such sequences at <m> x = 2 </m> and <m> x = 3 </m> . there are multiple of these sequences in sequential order at <m> y = x + i </m> since if <m> 2 : p _ i : p _ { i + 1 } : \cdots </m> is an ordering so is <m> p _ i : 2 : p _ { i + 1 } : \cdots </m> . depending on the number of primes , the same type of pattern will work for <m> 3 </m> or any other of the smaller primes . for example , if <m> x </m> is such a sequence and has the prime ordering of <m> 3 : 2 : 5 : 7 </m> , then necessarily , <m> x + 1 </m> is such a sequence and has the prime ordering of <m> 2 : 5 : 7 : 3 </m> at <m> x + 1 </m> the first nontrivial occurrence for the <m> 7 </m> is found at <m> x = 9 0 </m> since <m> 9 0 , 9 1 , 9 2 , 9 3 , 9 4 , 9 5 </m> shows the prime ordering of <m> 2 : 7 : 3 : 5 </m> i consider this nontrivial because <m> x > p _ { n + 1 } </m> . there is always a long sequence of consecutive integers where no least prime factor is greater than <m> p _ n </m> between <m> 2 </m> and <m> p _ { n + 1 } - 1 </m> . i know that there 's been very interesting work with jacobthal 's function that details the upper bound for this type of sequence . iwaniec has shown that <m> j ( n ) \ll ( \log n ) ^ 2 . </m> by <m> j ( n ) </m> , i mean the jacobthal functions which is defined as -LRB- from the oeis wiki -RRB- :
i have the following matrix arising when i tried to discretize the green function ， now to show the convergence of my algorithm i need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix <m> G </m> and show it has absolute value less than 1 for certain choices of <m> N </m> . note that the explicit formula for entry <m> ( i , j ) </m> is <m> - i ( N + 1 - j ) </m> when <m> i \le j </m> and it is symmetric , so we can get the formulas for <m> i > j </m> by interchanging <m> i </m> and <m> j </m> in the <m> i \le j </m> case . any one has any ideas about how to find the analytical representation of eigenvalues of the matrix <m> G </m> , i , e , the eigenvalues represented by <m> N </m> ? thank you so much for any help ! <m> \begin {pmatrix} - N & - N + 1 & - N + 2 & - N + 3 & \ldots & 1 ( - 2 ) & 1 ( - 1 ) \\ - N + 1 & 2 ( - N + 1 ) & 2 ( - N + 2 ) & 2 ( - N + 3 ) & \ddots & 2 ( - 2 ) & 2 ( - 1 ) \\ - N + 2 & 2 ( - N + 2 ) & 3 ( - N + 2 ) & 3 ( - N + 3 ) & \ddots & 3 ( - 2 ) & 3 ( - 1 ) \\ - N + 3 & 2 ( - N + 3 ) & 3 ( - N + 3 ) & 4 ( - N + 3 ) & \ddots & 4 ( - 2 ) & 4 ( - 1 ) \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\ - 2 & 2 ( - 2 ) & 3 ( - 2 ) & 4 ( - 2 ) & \ddots & ( - 1 + N ) ( - 2 ) & ( - 1 + N ) ( - 1 ) \\ - 1 & 2 ( - 1 ) & 3 ( - 1 ) & 4 ( - 1 ) & \ldots & ( - 1 + N ) ( - 1 ) & N ( - 1 ) \\ \end {pmatrix} </m>
i am studying the proof of the <m> \infty </m> - categorical version of the barr-beck theorem in lurie 's higher algebra , but there is a step of the proof that is puzzling me . in lemma 4.7.3.13 , a simplicial object <m> M _ { \bullet } </m> in the <m> \infty </m> - category <m> \mathrm { L M o d } _ T ( \mathcal C ) </m> is constucted as <m> \operatorname { B a r } _ T ( T , M ) _ { \bullet } </m> . my question is : what are the correct choices of <m> \mathcal C ^ { \otimes } </m> , <m> F _ 0 </m> and <m> f </m> in construction 4.4.2.7 in order to obtain the <m> \operatorname { B a r } _ T ( T , M ) _ { \bullet } </m> used in the proof of lemma 4.7.3.13 ? as far as i understand , the idea is to apply the bar construction -LRB- construction 4.4.2.7 -RRB- , to the cocartesian fibration of <m> \infty </m> - operads <m> \mathcal A ^ { \otimes } \to \mathcal { L M } ^ { \otimes } </m> -LRB- here i am using <m> \mathcal A </m> instead of <m> \mathcal C </m> to avoid the conflict of notation with the <m> \mathcal C </m> of lemma 4.7.3.13 -RRB- expressing <m> \mathcal C </m> as weakly enriched over <m> \mathrm { E n d } ( \mathcal C ) ^ { \otimes } </m> -LRB- that is , with <m> \mathcal A ^ { \otimes } _ { \mathfrak m } \simeq \mathcal C </m> and <m> \mathcal A ^ { \otimes } _ { \mathfrak a } \simeq \mathrm { E n d } ( \mathcal C ) ^ { \otimes } </m> -RRB- . my problem is now how to define <m> F _ 0 </m> and <m> f </m> -LRB- with the notations of construction 4.4.2.7 -RRB- in order to get <m> \operatorname { B a r } _ T ( T , M ) _ { \bullet } </m> , and even how to make sense of the `` bimodule instance '' of <m> T </m> in that expression . to be more precise , <m> F _ 0 </m> should determine two bimodules in <m> \mathcal C </m> , but since <m> \mathcal C </m> is only left tensored over <m> \mathrm { E n d } ( \mathcal C ) ^ { \otimes } </m> , i do n't know how to make sense of the construction -LRB- in fact , i do n't know how to make sense of the construction for any base <m> \infty </m> - operad other than <m> \mathcal O ^ { \otimes } = \mathcal { B M } ^ { \otimes } </m> -RRB- . moreover , even interpreting <m> M </m> as some sort of bimodule -LRB- maybe with some kind of trivial right action , but i am just guessing -RRB- , i ca n't find a way to interpret the second instance of <m> T </m> in the expression <m> \operatorname { B a r } _ T ( T , M ) _ { \bullet } </m> . or maybe i am just considering the wrong cocartesian fibration of <m> \infty </m> - operads to begin with , but then i have no clue about any other possible option .
let <m> p </m> be an odd prime and <m> G = ( \mathbb Z / ( p ) ) ^ \times = \{ 1 , 2 , . . . , p - 1 \} </m> i.e. <m> G </m> is a cyclic group of order <m> p - 1 </m> . let <m> \hat G : = \{ \chi : G \to \mathbb C ^ \times : \chi </m> is a group homomorphism <m> \} </m> . for any set <m> X </m> , let <m> \mathbb C ^ X </m> denote the set of all functions from <m> X </m> to <m> \mathbb C </m> , and note that this can be given a usual <m> \mathbb C </m> - algebra structure as <m> ( f + g ) ( x ) : = f ( x ) + g ( x ) , \forall x \in X </m> ; <m> ( f . g ) ( x ) = f ( x ) g ( x ) , \forall x \in X </m> , and <m> ( k . f ) ( x ) : = k f ( x ) , \forall x \in X </m> . let <m> n = p - 1 </m> , let <m> \omega = e ^ { 2 \pi i / p } </m> and define a function <m>  </m> as <m> f ( A ) ( \chi ) = \begin {pmatrix} \chi ( 1 ) & . . . & \chi ( p - 1 ) \end {pmatrix} A \begin {pmatrix} \omega \\ \omega ^ 2 \\ . \\ . \\ . \\ \omega ^ n \end {pmatrix} , \forall A \in M ( n , \mathbb C ) , \forall \chi \in \hat G </m> . it easily follows that <m> f </m> is a <m> \mathbb C </m> - linear function . moreover , <m> f ( A ) = 0 \implies A \begin {pmatrix} \omega \\ \omega ^ 2 \\ . \\ . \\ . \\ \omega ^ n \end {pmatrix} = 0 </m> . from this , it follows that since the minimal polynomial of <m> \omega </m> over <m> \mathbb Q </m> has degree <m> p - 1 = n </m> , so <m> A \in M ( n , \mathbb Q ) </m> and <m> A \begin {pmatrix} \omega \\ \omega ^ 2 \\ . \\ . \\ . \\ \omega ^ n \end {pmatrix} = 0 \implies A = O </m> , thus <m> A \in M ( n , \mathbb Q ) </m> and <m> f ( A ) = 0 \implies A = O </m> . now my questions are the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- for every <m> A , B \in M ( n , \mathbb Q ) </m> , does there exist <m> C \in M ( n , \mathbb Q ) </m> such that <m> f ( A ) . f ( B ) = f ( C ) </m> ? -LRB- notice that such a <m> C </m> , if exists , must be unique -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- how to show that there exists hermitian matrices <m> A _ 1 , . . . , A _ n </m> of rank <m> 1 </m> such that <m> f ( I ) = f ( A _ 1 ) + . . . + f ( A _ n ) </m> and <m> f ( A _ j ) f ( A _ k ) = 0 , \forall j \ne k </m> ? -LRB- may be this has something to do with orthogonality of characters ? -RRB-
let <m> G </m> be a connected , reductive group over a <m> p </m> - adic field <m> k </m> . let <m> P _ 0 </m> be a minimal parabolic subgroup of <m> G </m> containing a maximal split torus <m> A _ 0 </m> . let <m> K </m> be a maximal compact open subgroup of <m> G </m> in good position relative to <m> P _ 0 </m> , so we have <m> G = P _ 0 K </m> -LRB- if <m> G </m> is unramified , we can take <m> K </m> to be a conjugate of <m> G ( \mathcal O _ k ) </m> -RRB- . for each standard parabolic <m> P </m> , let <m> M </m> be the unique levi subgroup of <m> P </m> containing <m> A _ 0 </m> . does there always exist an open subgroup <m> H </m> of <m> K </m> such that we have <m> H = \bigg ( \prod \limits _ { \alpha \in \Phi ( A _ M , P ) _ { \textrm { r e d } } } ( H \cap N _ { - \alpha } ) \bigg ) ( H \cap M ) \bigg ( \prod \limits _ { \alpha \in \Phi ( A _ M , P ) _ { \textrm { r e d } } } ( H \cap N _ { \alpha } ) \bigg ) </m> ? here <m> A _ M </m> is the split component of <m> M </m> , and <m> N _ { \alpha } </m> is the product of the root subgroups <m> U _ a </m> for <m> a \in \Phi ( A _ 0 , G ) , a | _ { A _ M } = \alpha </m> . this is claimed in waldspurger 's notes on the plancherel measure for <m> p </m> - adic groups , based on harish-chandra 's lectures , section i. 1 .
hopefully this question is of an appropriate level for this site : i 'm reading some notes by claire voisin titled géométrie algébrique et géométrie complexe . let <m> X </m> be a smooth <m> k - </m> scheme . in these notes , one constructs the -LRB- algebraic -RRB- de rham complex <m> 0 \xrightarrow { } \mathscr { O } _ X \xrightarrow { d } \Omega _ { X / k } \xrightarrow { d } \Omega _ { X / k } ^ 2 \xrightarrow { d } \cdots \xrightarrow { d } \Omega _ { X / k } ^ n \xrightarrow { } 0 </m> where <m> n = \dim ( X ) </m> . now , one constructs the algebraic de rham cohomology by way of using the hypercohomology of the complex , <m> H ^ l _ { d R } ( X / k ) : = \mathbb { H } ^ l ( \Omega _ { X / k } ^ { \cdot } ) </m> . my question is not regarding the construction of the hypercohomology . i am just wondering why one should think to not use the ordinary cohomology of the complex in this case .
is the union of the complete curves on <m> \mathcal M _ g </m> zariski dense ? -LRB- <m> g \gg 0 </m> -RRB- i know it is hard to find higher-dimensional complete subvarieties of <m> \mathcal M _ g </m> , but a quasiprojective variety can have lots of complete curves but nothing higher dimensional , e.g. the complement of a codimension 2 linear subspace of <m> \mathbb P ^ n </m> . i am curious whether the known complete curves can deform in <m> \mathcal M _ g </m> .
we know from ramanujan and riemann that , <m> \pi ( x ) = \operatorname { l i } ( x ) - \tfrac 1 2 \operatorname { l i } ( x ^ { 1 / 2 } ) - \tfrac 1 3 \operatorname { l i } ( x ^ { 1 / 3 } ) - \tfrac 1 5 \operatorname { l i } ( x ^ { 1 / 5 } ) + \dots </m> with prime counting function <m> \pi ( x ) </m> and logarithmic integral <m> \operatorname { l i } ( x ) </m> . i was wondering if we truncate the <m> \text { R H S } </m> up to the second term and consider the function , <m> F ( x ) = \frac { \operatorname { l i } ( x ^ { 1 / 2 } ) } { \operatorname { l i } ( x ) - \pi ( x ) } </m> it turns out it has an interesting plot that peaks and dips excruciatingly slow . the plot below shows the first <m> 1 0 ^ 7 </m> positive integer <m> x </m> with the vertical axis as <m> F ( x ) </m> . when <m> x = \text { S k e w e s ' n u m b e r } </m> , of course it dips into a negative value , <m> \hspace { 1 . 8 i n } </m> it reaches <m> F ( x ) > 3 </m> first at <m> x _ 3 = 5 9 7 5 3 </m> , <m> \hspace { 1 . 8 i n } </m> <m> F ( x ) > 4 </m> at <m> x _ 4 = 3 0 9 0 2 1 2 9 </m> , <m> \hspace { 1 . 8 i n } </m> <m> F ( x ) > 5 </m> at <m> x _ 5 = 1 1 0 0 8 7 9 5 3 \approx 1 . 1 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 } </m> , <m> \hspace { 1 . 8 i n } </m> from this post , we find <m> x _ 6 = 3 3 0 9 4 6 4 7 4 0 7 3 \approx 3 . 3 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 } \, x _ 7 \overset { \color { red } ? } { = } 1 3 2 4 7 8 3 7 2 1 1 3 3 8 4 6 7 3 3 \approx 1 . 3 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 8 } </m> note : it seems there is a large jump to <m> x _ 7 </m> , so i 'm curious how high we have to go find <m> F ( x ) > 8 </m> .
i am searching for a book/lecture notes/articles where i can find the definition and properties of the <m> p r o - p </m> iwahori subgroup of <m> G L _ n ( F ) </m> , -LRB- with examples if possible -RRB- the iwahori decomposition of it , and its applications concerning the hecke algebra . the subgroups play an important role in the work of m.f. vigneras as evident from the appendix of this paper . my background : i know the basic theory of connected reductive groups -LRB- eg , book of humphreys -RRB- i know the basic elements of representation theory -LRB- eg , induction , restriction , parabolic induction and restriction , basic definition of relative hecke algebra for locally profinite groups -RRB- thank you for your help .
look at the expression <m> f ( x _ 1 , x _ 2 , x _ 3 ) = x _ 1 ^ 2 + x _ 2 ^ 2 + x _ 3 ^ 2 + x _ 1 x _ 2 + x _ 2 x _ 3 + x _ 3 x _ 1 . </m> the numbers <m> x _ 1 , x _ 2 , x _ 3 </m> are non-negative , and i assume that <m> x _ 1 + x _ 2 + x _ 3 = 3 </m> . this is a sum of squares and `` cyclic correlations '' of consecutive variables . then you can check that <m> f </m> is minimized for the values <m> x _ 1 = x _ 2 = x _ 3 = 1 </m> . now look at <m> g ( x _ 1 , x _ 2 , x _ 3 , x _ 4 ) = x _ 1 ^ 2 + x _ 2 ^ 2 + x _ 3 ^ 2 + x _ 4 ^ 2 + x _ 1 x _ 2 + x _ 2 x _ 3 + x _ 3 x _ 4 + x _ 4 x _ 1 , </m> under the assumption that <m> x _ 1 + x _ 2 + x _ 3 + x _ 4 = 4 </m> . again , this is minimized by <m> x _ 1 = x _ 2 = x _ 3 = x _ 4 = 1 </m> . a similar thing happens if i add `` second-order cyclic correlations '' : let <m> h ( x _ 1 , x _ 2 , x _ 3 , x _ 4 ) = x _ 1 ^ 2 + x _ 2 ^ 2 + x _ 3 ^ 2 + x _ 4 ^ 2 + x _ 1 x _ 2 + x _ 2 x _ 3 + x _ 3 x _ 4 + x _ 4 x _ 1 + x _ 1 x _ 3 + x _ 2 x _ 4 + x _ 3 x _ 1 + x _ 4 x _ 2 , </m> again under the assumption that <m> x _ 1 + x _ 2 + x _ 3 + x _ 4 = 4 </m> . this is also minimized for the values <m> x _ 1 = x _ 2 = x _ 3 = x _ 4 = 1 </m> . is there a simple explanation for this ? is there a simple argument showing that the same will happen for , say , 12 variables and correlations of order up to 3 ?

my question refers to an argument used in torsten ekedahl 's paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.3148 in example ii -RRB- -LRB- page 8 -RRB- : we consider a finite subgroup of affine transformation of <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 1 </m> . the main goal is to show that the class of the classifying stack <m> \{ B G \} </m> is <m> 1 </m> in <m> K _ o ( S t c k _ k ) </m> -LRB- the terminology is explained at the beginning -RRB- . here the excerpt :

let <m> L </m> be a dihedral quartic field . that is , we have <m> [ L : \mathbb { Q } ] = 4 </m> and the galois closure <m> M </m> of <m> L </m> is a degree 8 extension of <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> with galois group isomorphic to the dihedral group <m> D _ 4 </m> of order 8 . it is well-known -LRB- see the diagram on page 6 of this paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01729 -RRB- that <m> M </m> contains five subfields which are degree 4 extensions of <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> ; say <m> L = L _ 1 , L _ 2 , L _ 0 , L _ 3 , L _ 4 </m> . in particular , <m> L _ 1 , L _ 2 </m> are galois conjugates and contain a common quadratic field <m> K _ 1 </m> , <m> L _ 0 </m> is a galois extension of <m> \mathbb { Q } </m> and has galois group isomorphic to <m> C _ 2 \times C _ 2 </m> , while <m> ( L _ 3 , L _ 4 ) </m> is related to <m> ( L _ 1 , L _ 2 ) </m> via an outer automorphism which comes from the group theory of <m> D _ 4 </m> , which we denote by <m> \phi </m> . in this language , we identify <m> L _ 3 = \phi ( L _ 1 ) , L _ 4 = \phi ( L _ 2 ) </m> and <m> L _ 3 , L _ 4 </m> are galois conjugates . given <m> L </m> , it is of course possible -LRB- say via the primitive element theorem -RRB- to find a quartic polynomial <m> f </m> such that for some root <m> \alpha </m> of <m> f </m> we have <m> L = \mathbb { Q } ( \alpha ) </m> . my question is , given a quartic polynomial <m> f </m> such that for some root <m> \alpha </m> of <m> f </m> we have <m> L = \mathbb { Q } ( \alpha ) </m> is a dihedral quartic field , how to find a polynomial <m> g </m> whose coefficients are algebraic functions of the coefficients of <m> f </m> such that for some root <m> \beta </m> of <m> g </m> we have <m> \phi ( L ) = \mathbb { Q } ( \beta ) </m> ? moreover , can one take advantage of the invariant theory of the homogenized binary quartic form <m> F ( x , y ) = y ^ 4 f ( x / y ) </m> ? that is , is <m> g </m> naturally given by some quartic covariant of <m> F </m> ?
let algebras be finite dimensional over a field <m> K </m> and let <m> J </m> denote the jacobson radical -LRB- this is the intersection of all maximal right ideals -RRB- of an algebra . being hereditary means that the algebra has global dimension at most 1 . question :
let <m> X </m> be a projective variety -LRB- so , with some -LRB- edit : fixed nondegenerate closed -RRB- embedding -RRB- with the following curious property : for every hyperplane section <m> H </m> , we have that <m> X - H \cong \mathbb { A } ^ n </m> . then is <m> X </m> necessarily isomorphic to <m> \mathbb { P } ^ n </m> ? assuming we are over the complex numbers for simplicity , one can show that <m> X </m> has the same hodge diamond as <m> \mathbb { C P } ^ n </m> using purely topological arguments -LRB- such as long exact sequence of a pair , duality as in the proof of lefschetz hyperplane , etc. -RRB- but this does not rule out these potential fake projective spaces . this question is motivated by the fact that spheres are characterized by a similar property ; i.e. , a closed oriented manifold that is contractible upon removal of any point will be homeomorphic to a sphere .
let <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> be two finite dimensional <m> k </m> - algebra where <m> k </m> is a field . suppose that a left <m> A \otimes B </m> - module <m> H </m> is flat as left <m> A </m> - module and flat as left <m> B </m> - module , i would like to know if <m> H </m> is also flat as a left <m> A \otimes B </m> - module ?
the following question has been on math.se for several days . without having a satisfying answer , i 'd like to ask the experts here . in mathematics , the big <m> O </m> notation is used to describe the limiting behavior of a function . it is abuse of notation to say <m> f ( x ) = O ( g ( x ) ) . </m> but this is understandable . however , in the class of numerical analysis , i found that the teacher used the big <m> O </m> notation as the following :
is it possible that <m> \mathbb { P } ^ n </m> is an algebraic vector bundle over some algebraic variety ? this is an interesting question that my friend asked in a student seminar . i believe that the answer is not . because the only global sections of <m> \mathcal { O } _ { \mathbb { P } ^ n } </m> are constants . however as a total space of vector bundles <m> E </m> over <m> X </m> , the global sections are all in <m> \Gamma ( X , \oplus S y m ^ n E ) = \oplus \Gamma ( X , S y m ^ n E ) </m> which may not be <m> \mathbb { C } </m> in general . the trouble case is when <m> \Gamma ( X , E ) = 0 </m> ? am i correct ? is there any other explanation ? edit : thanks to everyone for your comments and answer . it seems that compactness is the correct way to follow . however , i still wondering that why the argument on sections does n't work . in other words , is there an example of a non-proper algebraic variety whose structure sheaf only has constant global sections .
let <m> X </m> be a smooth stack and <m> \mathcal O _ X </m> the ring of smooth functions on <m> X </m> , i.e. for any smooth <m> M \to X </m> , <m> \mathcal O _ X ( M \to X ) = C ^ \infty ( M ) </m> . in higheralgebra , the derived category <m> \mathcal D ( X ) </m> is defined to be the differential graded nerve of <m> \mathrm { M o d } ( \mathcal O _ X ) ^ \circ </m> , the full subcategory spanned by the fibrant objects -LRB- note that <m> \mathrm { M o d } ( \mathcal O _ X ) </m> is grothendieck abelian -RRB- . are there good references for the theory of derived functors in this setting ? is it known when projection formula and -LRB- flat -RRB- base change work ? edit : let me explain why i think that the second question is a sensible one to ask . -LRB- i must admit that i found these sources after i posted that question -RRB- there are some rather general results for the unbounded derived category in spaltenstein . propositions -LRB- 6.18 -RRB- and -LRB- 6.20 -RRB- prove base change and projection formula in the case of ringed spaces -LRB- given some finiteness-condition on the ring -RRB- . closer and at the same time further from my setting -LRB- topological stacks , but only sheaves of abelian groups and the push-forward has to have finite cohomological dimension -RRB- is lemma -LRB- 6.5.7 -RRB- in this article . one of the applications i have in mind is proving that fourier-mukai transformations are closed under composition - the only proof i know relies on base change and the projection formula .
just started learning the stone-cech compactification of discrete groups this week . my motivation comes from a question on <m> \beta \mathbb { Z } </m> . surprisingly , i realized there are muchhhh more literature devoted to <m> \beta \mathbb { N } </m> than to <m> \beta \mathbb { Z } </m> . i wonder why is that ? after all , algebraically <m> \mathbb { N } </m> is a semigroup while <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> is a group , and as discrete topological spaces they are homeomorphic . from your experience , how far <m> \beta \mathbb { N } </m> and <m> \beta \mathbb { Z } </m> are different in behaviour ? also , is <m> \beta \mathbb { N } </m> -LRB- or -LRB- <m> \beta \mathbb { N } \setminus \mathbb { N } </m> -RRB- easier to deal with ?
the question i would be asking is roughly : do the smooth sobolev functions defined on an open bounded domain extend to smooth sobolev functions on the euclidean space ? for detail : fix <m> p \geq 1 . </m> by the word ` smooth ' , i will always mean <m> C ^ { \infty } </m> . let <m> U , V </m> be two bounded , connected open domains in <m> \mathbb { R } ^ n </m> with smooth boundary , so that <m> \bar { U } \subset V </m> . let <m> u \in W ^ { 1 , p } ( U ) \cap C ^ 0 ( \bar { U } ) </m> . in many pde books -LRB- for example , l.c. evans ' `` partial differential equations '' , p. 254 -RRB- there are standard methods described to produce an extension <m> E u </m> of <m> u </m> such that : <m> E u \in W ^ { 1 , p } ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) , s u p p o r t ( E u ) \subset V , E u = u </m> a.e.on <m> U </m> . the method is first to treat the case where <m> u \in W ^ { 1 , p } ( U ) \cap C ^ 0 ( \bar { U } ) \cap C ^ { \infty } ( \bar { U } ) </m> , locally flatten the boundary <m> \partial { U } </m> , extend <m> u </m> by higher order reflection across the boundary , using partition of unity and then approach arbitrary <m> u \in W ^ { 1 , p } ( U ) </m> by <m> C ^ { \infty } ( \bar { U } ) </m> functions in <m> W ^ { 1 , p } ( U ) </m> - norm . we do not even need <m> u \in C ^ 0 ( \bar { U } ) </m> in this proof . i understand that if <m> u \in C ^ { \infty } ( \bar { U } ) </m> as well . , then <m> E u \in C ^ \infty ( \mathbb { R } ^ n ) </m> , but is the same true if <m> u \in C ^ { \infty } ( U ) \cap C ^ 0 ( \bar { U } ) </m> only , not <m> C ^ { \infty } ( \bar { U } ) </m> ? this is my main question .

i would like to calculate the set of <m> z \in \mathbb { C } ^ d </m> such that there exists a constant <m> C > 0 </m> such that for every homogeneous polynomial <m> p </m> in <m> d </m> variables <m> | p ( z ) | \leq C \sup _ { x \in [ 0 , 1 ] ^ d } | p ( x ) | . </m> or at least the interior of this set . i can show that it contains a polydisk of radius <m> 1 / 1 0 0 0 </m> or so , but i assume better bounds are attainable or known . that is , the described set contains the <m> z \in \mathbb { C } ^ d </m> such that each <m> | z _ i | < 1 / 1 0 0 0 . </m> so specifically , is there an exact description of this set ?

the question has relevance for constructing scott sets with certain extra desirable properties . suppose that <m> \mathfrak X </m> is a countable arithmetically closed family of subsets of <m> \mathbb N </m> : whenever <m> B \in \mathfrak X </m> and <m> C </m> is definable in <m> \langle \mathbb N , + , \cdot , < , B , 0 , 1 \rangle </m> , then <m> C \in \mathfrak X </m> . let us fix some <m> C \notin \mathfrak X </m> . i would like to find a set <m> A </m> that is almost contained in either <m> B </m> or <m> B ^ c </m> for every <m> B \in \mathfrak X </m> , which has the property that <m> C </m> is not in the arithmetic closure of <m> \mathfrak X </m> with <m> A </m> . thus , closing <m> \mathfrak X </m> and <m> A </m> under definability does not introduce <m> C </m> . i am willing to add such an <m> A </m> by forcing -LRB- for a ground model set <m> C </m> -RRB- but i am inclining more and more towards a counterexample . is there an arithmetically closed family <m> \mathfrak X </m> and a set <m> C \notin \mathfrak X </m> so that an <m> A </m> almost contained in every element of <m> \mathfrak X </m> or its complement always `` codes in '' <m> C </m> ?
what kind of singularity is commonly meant by <m> A _ { \infty } </m> ?
let <m> N _ H ^ G </m> be the norm functor from orthogonal <m> H </m> - spectra to orthogonal <m> G </m> - spectra . we know the category of orthogonal <m> G </m> - spectra <m> \mathcal { S } _ G </m> is enriched over the category of based <m> G </m> - spaces <m> \mathcal { T } _ G </m> -LRB- working with compactly generated weak hausdorff spaces -RRB- . we also know that <m> \mathcal { S } _ G </m> is tensored over <m> \mathcal { T } _ G </m> using the level-wise smash product <m> ( X \wedge E ) ( V ) = X \wedge E ( V ) , </m> where <m> X </m> is a <m> G </m> - space and <m> E </m> is a <m> G </m> - spectrum , and <m> \mathcal { S } _ G </m> is also cotensored over <m> \mathcal { T } _ G </m> using the internal hom space <m> F ( - , - ) </m> again applied level-wise <m> ( F ( X , E ) ) ( V ) = F ( X , E ( V ) ) . </m> on page 140 , remark a. 55 of hill , hopkins and ravenel -LRB- kervaire invariant one v4 -RRB- it is stated that because <m> N _ H ^ G </m> is strong symmetric monoidal , then it extends to a functor of enriched categories , which implies that we have a map <m> \phi : N _ H ^ G ( \mathcal { S } _ H ( E , E ' ) ) \longrightarrow \mathcal { S } _ G ( N _ H ^ G E , N _ H ^ G E ' ) . </m> by specialising to the case where the <m> E </m> above is a suspension spectrum , using the shift desuspension-evaluation -LRB- or maybe generalised suspension-loop -RRB- adjunction <m> \mathcal { S } _ G ( \Sigma ^ { \infty + V } X , E ) \cong \mathcal { T } _ G ( X , E ( V ) ) </m> and the interaction of <m> N _ H ^ G </m> with free spectra <m> \Sigma ^ { \infty + V } X </m> , i would like to make a statement about this map <m> \phi </m> is the case below . <m> \Phi : N _ H ^ G ( F ( X , E ) ) \longrightarrow F ( N _ H ^ G X , N _ H ^ G E ) </m> specifically i would love to know when this map is a weak -LRB- stable -RRB- equivalence of orthogonal <m> G </m> - spectra . i have a feeling it will be when <m> E </m> is cofibrant and maybe even <m> X </m> is also cofibrant . i can not seem to tick the right boxes and piece it all together . i appreciate anyone 's insight .
consider the <m> \ell ^ 2 </m> complex hilbert space . let <m> m \in \mathbb { N } ^ * </m> be a fixed number , and set <m> S = \left \{ x = ( x _ n ) _ n \subset \ell ^ 2 \ : \ \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ m \frac { | x _ n | ^ 2 } { n ^ 2 } = 1 \right \} . </m>
let <m> G _ n </m> be the complete graph whose vertices are the <m> 2 ^ n </m> <m> n </m> - bit strings . let <m> H _ n </m> denote the hamiltonian path through <m> G _ n </m> that uses the maximum number of edges that correspond to a single bit transition <m> 0 \mapsto 1 </m> . what is this maximum number ? and is there an algorithm that generates this hamiltonian path ? the classical gray code is a hamiltonian path that uses only edges with <m> 0 \mapsto 1 </m> or <m> 1 \mapsto 0 </m> transitions -LRB- single bit flips in both directions -RRB- . i want to use as many single bit flips as possible in one direction -LRB- <m> 0 \to 1 </m> -RRB- and have no restrictions on other transitions . here is an example for <m> n = 4 </m> that uses 10 <m> ( 0 \mapsto 1 ) </m> transitions <m> ( \rightarrow ) </m> and 6 others <m> ( \Rightarrow ) </m> : <m> 0 0 0 0 \rightarrow 0 0 0 1 \rightarrow 0 0 1 1 \rightarrow 0 1 1 1 \rightarrow 1 1 1 1 \Rightarrow 0 0 1 0 \rightarrow 0 1 1 0 \rightarrow 1 1 1 0 \Rightarrow 0 1 0 0 \rightarrow 0 1 0 1 \rightarrow 1 1 0 1 \Rightarrow 1 0 0 0 \rightarrow 1 0 0 1 \rightarrow 1 0 1 1 \Rightarrow 1 0 1 0 \Rightarrow 1 1 0 0 \Rightarrow 0 0 0 0 </m>
my question extends this one : 1 . in hermann koenig 's book : eigenvalue distribution of compact operators -LRB- page 145 -RRB- , the mercer 's theorem is stated with an extra claim . given a mercer 's kernel <m> k </m> , the hilbert-schmidt integral operator is defined as <m> T _ k : ( T _ k f ) ( x ) = \int _ y k ( x , y ) f ( y ) d y </m> then the book claims that the eigenfunctions for <m> T _ k </m> are uniformly bounded in the <m> L _ \infty </m> norm : <m> \sup _ { n } \| f _ n \| _ \infty < \infty </m> . here eigenfunctions <m> f _ n </m> have unit <m> L _ 2 </m> norm . see a scanned copy of the page here : 2 . the answers in the above link have constructed a counter-example . however i 'm wondering if there is any natural condition we can put on the kernel in order to guarantee the uniform boundedness . for example , it surely holds true for the standard gaussian rbf kernel . but how about the kernel <m> k ( x , y ) = \frac { 1 } { 2 - x ^ \top y } </m> over the unit ball in <m> R ^ n </m> ? it 's sometimes called inverse kernel , but i do n't want to confuse with the `` inverse of the kernel '' .
-LRB- disclaimer : i 'm totally ignorant about <m> \mathbb { F } _ 1 </m> theory -RRB- there are now -LRB- several -RRB- working definitions of the `` field with one element '' <m> \mathbb { F } _ 1 </m> -LRB- not literally a field , of course -RRB- , and certain mathematical objects `` over <m> \mathbb { F } _ 1 </m> '' are recognized . for example , <m> \mathbb { F } _ 1 </m> - vector spaces are pointed sets , <m> \mathrm { G L } _ n ( \mathbb { F } _ 1 ) </m> is the symmetric group <m> \mathfrak { S } _ n </m> on <m> n </m> elements -LRB- or was it <m> n - 1 </m> ? <m> n + 1 </m> ? -RRB- . as far as i remember there 's even a notion of `` algebraic variety over <m> \mathbb { F } _ 1 </m> '' : they are related to toric varieties . so , my question :
one way to define the compact group <m> S p i n ( 7 ) </m> is as the stabilizer of a certain 4-form on euclidean <m> \mathbb R ^ 8 </m> -LRB- see e.g. this mo question -RRB- . this 4-form can be defined in various ways . for example , it can be interpreted in terms of octonions as <m> \Omega ( w , x , y , z ) = \langle w , x ( \bar y z ) - z ( \bar y x ) \rangle ) </m> where <m> y \mapsto \bar y </m> is octonionic conjugation and <m> \langle , \rangle </m> is the standard inner product . a curious fact about this 4-form is that the indices that appear in each monomial are precisely the -LRB- length four -RRB- words in the hamming code <m> H a m ( 8 , 4 ) </m> . is this just a coincidence -LRB- perhaps because all of these objects relate to the octonions -RRB- ? the <m> E _ 8 </m> - lattice can be constructed from <m> H a m ( 8 , 4 ) </m> in a routine way .
2d topological field theories <m> Z : \mathrm { C o b } ( 2 ) \to \mathrm { V e c t } </m> are classified by commutative frobenius algebras . what can be said about <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> 2d tfts <m> Z : \mathrm { C o b } ( 2 ) \to \mathcal { S } </m> with values in a symmetric monoidal <m> ( \infty , 1 ) </m> - category <m> \mathcal { S } </m> ? i am interested in different targets <m> \mathcal { S } </m> . i know that <m> Z ( \mathbb { S } ^ 1 ) </m> is naturally an <m> E _ 2 </m> - algebra in <m> \mathcal { S } </m> , but certainly it has more structure . please note that i do not refer to fully extended -LRB- i.e. 2-1-0-dimensional -RRB- tfts .
suppose that <m> R </m> is a -LRB- local -RRB- ring and <m> r \in R </m> . when do the equations <m> A n n _ R ( A n n _ R ( r ) ) = R r </m> or <m> \sqrt { A n n _ R ( A n n _ R ( r ) ) } = \sqrt { R r } </m> hold ? i already know that it holds for artinian gorenstein rings -LRB- due to an exercise in bruns-herzog -RRB- and it seems to be true for <m> R = \Bbb { Z } / n \Bbb { Z } </m> . the question is more interesting when we also assume that <m> A n n _ R ( r ) \in A s s ( R ) </m>
from brooks ' theorem , we know that if a graph <m> G </m> satisfies that <m> \Delta ( G ) = 4 </m> and there is no <m> 5 </m> - clique in <m> G </m> , then <m> \chi ( G ) \leq 4 </m> . and it is easy to find a counterexample to the following : if a graph <m> G </m> satisfies that <m> \Delta ( G ) = 4 </m> and there is no <m> 4 </m> - clique in <m> G </m> , then <m> \chi ( G ) \leq 3 </m> . i want to ask whether the following conclusion is right or please give a counterexample ! if a graph <m> G </m> satisfies that <m> \Delta ( G ) = 4 </m> and there is no <m> 3 </m> - clique in <m> G </m> , then <m> \chi ( G ) \leq 3 </m> .
as part of a project related to kinematic fluid dynamics , the following integral appeared in the moment expansion <m> \int _ 0 ^ { \alpha } t ^ m \, _ 2 F _ 0 \left ( \begin {matrix} - \ell - \frac { 1 } { 2 } , m + 2 \\ - \end {matrix} ; \frac { t - 1 } { \epsilon } \right ) d t </m> now while i have no illusions that this has a closed form , it is sufficient to be able to evaluate it numerically . since <m> \alpha </m> is usually positive and not large compared to 1 , a numeric integration should be fairly efficient provided there is an efficient way to calculate <m> _ 2 F _ 0 </m> . unfortunately , i ca n't seem to find good routines to do that . most special function packages have the related function <m> _ 1 U _ 1 </m> , but that often requires evaluating it at very large arguments , raising concerns about accuracy . does anyone know of a good numerical method for calculation <m> _ 2 F _ 0 </m> directly ?
let <m> X </m> be a smooth complex algebraic variety , and <m> \mathscr { E } </m> a torsion-free coherent sheaf on <m> X </m> .
let <m> L </m> be an elliptic operator of the form <m> L u : = ( - 1 ) ^ m \sum _ { | \alpha | = 2 m } a _ \alpha ( x ) D ^ \alpha u + \sum _ { | \alpha | \leq 2 m - 1 } b _ \alpha ( x ) D ^ \alpha u </m> with smooth coefficients and <m> u </m> defined in a smooth bounded domain of <m> R ^ N </m> , <m> N \geq 2 m </m> . are there some kind of schauder type estimates for solutions of the problem <m> L u = f ( x ) , </m> coupled with some boundary conditions -LRB- for example dirichlet or navier boundary conditions -RRB- . as far as i know such kind or results exist but for operator of the form <m> L u = ( - \Delta ) ^ m u + \sum _ { | \alpha | \leq 2 m - 1 } c _ \alpha ( x ) D ^ \alpha u . </m>
the isomorphism <m> { ( M \otimes _ { S } N ) } _ { f } = M _ { f } \otimes _ { S _ { f } } N _ { f } </m> is well-known . here , <m> S </m> is a graded ring , and <m> M , N </m> are graded <m> S </m> modules . now , let <m> f </m> be any homogeneous element of <m> S </m> of degree 1 . i want to have <m> { ( M \otimes _ { S } N ) } _ { ( f ) } = M _ { ( f ) } \otimes _ { S _ { ( f ) } } N _ { ( f ) } </m> . here , <m> L _ { ( f ) } </m> means the zero-degree part of <m> L _ { f } </m> for any graded <m> S </m> - module <m> L </m> . by using the first formula , the problem reduces to the following assertion : can the zero-degree part of <m> M _ { f } \otimes _ { S _ { f } } N _ { f } </m> be identified with <m> M _ { ( f ) } \otimes _ { S _ { ( f ) } } N _ { ( f ) } </m> ? i see that there is a canonical homomorphism <m> M _ { ( f ) } \otimes _ { S _ { ( f ) } } N _ { ( f ) } \to M _ { f } \otimes _ { S _ { f } } N _ { f } </m> , and i also see that the image of this homomorphism equals to the zero-degree part of <m> M _ { f } \otimes _ { S _ { f } } N _ { f } </m> . however , i can not prove that this homomorphism is injective .
let us say a set <m> X </m> satisfies property a if <m> \liminf _ { n \to \infty } { { \left | X ^ { \le n } \right | } \over n } = 0 . </m> are there recursive sets <m> X </m> satisfying property a that contain infinitely many incompressible strings ?
let <m> n </m> be a positive integer . the euler <m> \phi </m> - function is defined by <m> \displaystyle \phi ( n ) = \# \{ 1 \leq a \leq n - 1 : \gcd ( a , n ) = 1 \} . </m> it is in fact a multiplicative function , and one has the formula <m> \displaystyle \phi ( n ) = n \prod _ { p | n } \left ( 1 - \frac { 1 } { p } \right ) . </m> let <m> S _ \phi ( X ) </m> be the number of <m> 1 \leq n \leq X </m> such that <m> \gcd ( n , \phi ( n ) ) = 1 </m> . does <m> S _ \phi ( X ) </m> have an asymptotic formula ? it is easy to see that for any prime <m> p </m> we have <m> \gcd ( p , \phi ( p ) ) = 1 </m> , so <m> \displaystyle S _ \phi ( X ) \gg X ( \log X ) ^ { - 1 } , </m> but whenever <m> n </m> is not square-free , we have <m> \gcd ( n , \phi ( n ) ) > 1 </m> . therefore <m> S _ \phi ( X ) \leq ( 1 - \zeta ( 2 ) ^ { - 1 } ) X </m> .
hi , let g be a smooth commutative <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> - group scheme of finite type and let <m> G _ 0 </m> be the <m> \mathbb { Q } _ p </m> - fiber . we have an embedding <m> G ( \mathbb { Z } _ p ) \subseteq G _ 0 ( \mathbb { Q } _ p ) </m> . my question is does every torsion point in <m> G _ 0 ( \mathbb { Q } _ p ) </m> come from a torsion point in <m> G ( \mathbb { Z } _ p ) </m> ? i am mostly interested in the prime-to-p part of the torsion group . i think that the answer to this quesiton is yes , but i ca n't figure out how to prove it . any ideas or references would be greatly appreciated . thanks in advance !
hello , i 'm interested in the distribution of the trace of an inverse-wishart matrix <m> W _ n ^ { - 1 } ( I , n ) </m> , where <m> I </m> is <m> n \times n </m> identity matrix . more precisely , i seek for an asymptotic estimate -LRB- when <m> n \to \infty </m> -RRB- for a function <m> f ( n ) </m> such that <m> P r [ T r ( W ) < f ( n ) ] > 2 / 3 </m> , say . what i 've learned so far :
i am trying to understand the notation <m> \rho ^ { \vee } ( - 1 ) </m> . let <m> T </m> be a maximal torus of a semi-simple algebraic group <m> G </m> and <m> \mathbb { G } _ m </m> the multiplicative group . i think that <m> \rho ^ { \vee } </m> is a map <m> \mathbb { G } _ m \to T </m> which satisfies <m> \alpha _ i ( \rho ^ { \vee } ( s ) ) = s </m> for all <m> s \in \mathbb { G } _ m </m> , where <m> \alpha _ i : T \to \mathbb { G } _ m </m> are simple roots . suppose that <m> G = S L _ n </m> . then elements in <m> T </m> are <m> n \times n </m> matrices . the element <m> \rho ^ { \vee } ( - 1 ) \in T </m> is an <m> n \times n </m> matrix . how to write this matrix explicitly ? thank you very much .

i would like to know what can be said about -LRB- global -RRB- deformations of holomorphic/algebraic rank two vector bundles on <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 3 </m> . i am particularly interested in the case of topologically trivial bundles , i.e. , where the chern classes as well as atiyah-rees - <m> \alpha </m> - invariant are trivial . a precise question would be : is it true that every topologically trivial rank two vector bundle on <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 3 </m> can be deformed to the trivial bundle ? if not , how could one define a reasonable invariant to distinguish non-deformable bundles ? -LRB- the parameter space of the deformation could be anything , not necessarily irreducible or smooth . -RRB- i guess this question could possibly be phrased asking if the moduli of vector bundles of topologically trivial rank two bundles is connected but this is a bit delicate because we are dealing with unstable bundles and so there is no coarse moduli space as such . i only know a single paper discussing questions like this for rank two bundles on <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 3 </m> -LRB- apart from the huge body of literature which focuses only on stable bundles -RRB- :
let <m> K </m> be a compact hausdorff space . i wonder whether there are characterizations of <m> K </m> such that <m> C ( K ) </m> contains no copy of <m> l _ { 1 } </m> . there are some compact hausdorff spaces <m> K </m> such that <m> C ( K ) </m> contains no copy of <m> l _ { 1 } </m> , for example , if <m> K </m> is a countable compact metric space and has finite cantor-bendixson index . are there more compact hausdorff spaces <m> K </m> such that <m> C ( K ) </m> contains no copy of <m> l _ { 1 } </m> ? thank you !

my conjecture is that if <m> G ( z ) </m> has no zeros then <m> \sum \limits _ { i = 0 } ^ \infty { \left | { { q _ i } } \right | } < \infty </m> . if this conjecture is not ture , can somebody give me a counterexample . the problem 1 is similar to an open problem ： problem 2 . let <m> f ( t ) = \sum \limits _ { k = 0 } ^ \infty { { a _ k } { e ^ { k i t } } } </m> , we use the norm <m> \left \| f \right \| = \sum \limits _ { k = 0 } ^ \infty { \left | { { a _ k } } \right | } </m> . under which conditions on <m> f </m> is the sequence <m> \left \| { { f ^ n } } \right \| </m> bounded ?

consider the <m> n </m> - dimensional hamming cube , <m> C = \{ - 1 , 1 \} ^ n </m> . given an <m> n \times n </m> orthogonal matrix <m> O </m> , i 'll measure `` how close <m> O </m> is to being an isometry of <m> C </m> '' by the following scoring function : <m> s ( O ) = \frac { 1 } { 2 ^ n } \sum _ { x \in C } \left | \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } ( O x ) _ i \right | . </m> intuitively , <m> s ( O ) </m> measures how close the image of each <m> x \in C </m> is to belonging in <m> C </m> , averaged over all <m> x \in C </m> . it 's not hard to see that <m> s ( O ) \le 1 </m> for all <m> O </m> , with equality if and only if <m> O </m> is just a product of reflections and permutations of the <m> n </m> coordinates -LRB- i.e. , `` trivial '' -RRB- . my question is the following : if <m> s ( O ) </m> is non-negligibly large -LRB- say , <m> \ge n ^ { - O ( 1 ) } </m> -RRB- , then must <m> O </m> be `` close '' to a product of reflections and permutations of the coordinates ? here , by `` close , '' i mean that <m> O </m> contains some diagonal whose product is at least <m> n ^ { - O ( 1 ) } </m> in absolute value . i should mention that my summer student sumegha garg did a computer search for interesting examples of such <m> O </m> , for <m> n </m> up to about <m> 1 0 </m> , but did n't find much . when <m> n = 4 </m> , the hadamard matrix does fairly well , achieving <m> s ( O ) = 1 / 2 </m> , but we 've checked that <m> s ( O ) </m> decreases exponentially with <m> n </m> for <m> n \times n </m> fourier and hadamard matrices and tensor products thereof . a few words about where this question came from : it 's not hard to show that the permanent of an <m> n \times n </m> matrix <m> A </m> can be expressed in the following form -LRB- the so-called `` glynn formula '' -RRB- . <m> \operatorname { P e r } ( A ) = \frac { 1 } { 2 ^ n } \sum _ { x \in C } \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } x _ i ( A x ) _ i </m> . so in particular , we have <m> \left | \operatorname { P e r } ( A ) \right | \le s ( A ) </m> , and if <m> O </m> is orthogonal , then <m> \left | \operatorname { P e r } ( O ) \right | \le s ( O ) \le 1 </m> , with equality achieved if and only if <m> O </m> is a product of reflections and permutations of the coordinates . now , for reasons arising from linear-optical quantum computing , my student alex arkhipov and i would like to know whether there are any <m> n \times n </m> orthogonal matrices <m> O </m> satisfying <m> \left | \operatorname { P e r } ( O ) \right | \ge n ^ { - O ( 1 ) } </m> , which are far from the `` trivial '' examples -- i.e. , reflections and permutations of the coordinates . -LRB- actually , we 'd like to know the answer for unitary matrices , but if we do n't even know it for real orthogonal matrices , then we might as well start there . -RRB- and this naturally led to the stronger conjecture that there is n't even any nontrivial rotation <m> O </m> of the hamming cube that produces a large value of <m> s ( O ) </m> . as a final remark , arkhipov managed to show that , if <m> O </m> is orthogonal and <m> \left | \operatorname { P e r } ( O ) \right | \ge \sqrt { 1 - 1 / e } </m> , then <m> O </m> is close to a product of reflections and permutations of the coordinates . i 'm not sure whether his proof generalizes to all <m> O </m> such that <m> s ( O ) \ge \sqrt { 1 - 1 / e } </m> . in any case , the techniques do n't seem to generalize to <m> s ( O ) \ge n ^ { - O ( 1 ) } </m> . update : sumegha garg notes that , if we consider <m> n \times n </m> unitary matrices <m> U </m> rather than just real orthogonal matrices <m> O </m> , then there is a way to get <m> s ( U ) = 1 </m> , despite <m> U </m> not containing any diagonal whose product is <m> n ^ { - O ( 1 ) } </m> in absolute value . the way to do it is to let <m> U </m> be block-diagonal , with <m> 2 \times 2 </m> blocks of the form <m>  </m> . on the other hand , this is essentially the only counterexample we know , and even in the complex case , the conjecture could easily be reformulated to account for it .
this relates to this question : existence of maximal totally ramified extensions of an arbitrary cdvf let <m> K </m> be a local field with finite residue field of characteristic <m> p > 0 </m> . does there exist a maximal totally ramified <m> p </m> - extension of <m> K </m> ? in other words , if <m> K ^ { t a m e } </m> is the maximal tamely ramified extension of <m> K </m> , does the short exact sequence <m> 1 \longrightarrow G a l ( K ^ { s e p } / K ^ { t a m e } ) \longrightarrow G a l ( K ^ { s e p } / K ) \longrightarrow G a l ( K ^ { t a m e } / K ) \longrightarrow 1 </m> split ? my guess would be that it does n't , but maybe there is some trick i am missing here .
let <m> S </m> be a sub-ring of a commutative ring with unity <m> R </m> . then <m> S </m> is called factorially closed in <m> R </m> if <m> a , b \in R </m> and <m> a b \in S \setminus \{ 0 \} \implies a , b \in S </m> . let <m> k </m> be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic . let <m> A </m> be a factorially closed , finitely generated , <m> k </m> - sub-algebra of <m> k [ X _ 1 , X _ 2 , X _ 3 ] </m> such that <m> t r . d e g _ k A = 2 </m> . then is it true that <m> A </m> is a polynomial ring in <m> 2 </m> - variables over <m> k </m> i.e. <m> A </m> is isomorphic as a <m> k </m> - algebra to <m> k [ T _ 1 , T _ 2 ] </m> ? when <m> k </m> is algebraically closed and of characteristic zero , then the answer is affirmative -LSB- theorem 1 , factorially closed subrings of commutative rings , pp. 1140 -RSB-

let <m> K </m> be a multiplicatively written semigroup -LRB- either commutative or not -RRB- and <m> H </m> a subsemigroup of <m> K </m> . we say that <m> H </m> is divisor-closed -LRB- in <m> K </m> -RRB- if <m> x \in H </m> for all <m> x , y \in K </m> such that <m> x \mid _ K y </m> -LRB- i.e. , <m> y = u x v </m> for some <m> u , v \in K </m> -RRB- and <m> y \in H </m> . accordingly , we say that a semigroup <m> S </m> is annular -LRB- bear with me , i do n't have a better word for the moment -RRB- if it embeds as a divisor-closed subsemigroup into the multiplicative monoid of a ring . so here is my question :
in hilbert 's nullstellensatz is in the polynomial hierarchy , p. koiran showed that , given a system of <m> S </m> of <m> m </m> polynomials on <m> n </m> variables of maximum degree <m> d </m> , along with a number <m> x _ 0 </m> exponential in <m> m , n , d </m> , whether or not <m> f _ 1 [ x _ 1 , \cdots , x _ n ] = \cdots = f _ m [ x _ 1 , \cdots , x _ n ] = 0 \: \: \: ( * ) </m> with coefficients in <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> has a solution in <m> \mathbb { C } ^ n </m> , depends on the number <m> \pi _ S ( x _ 0 ) </m> of primes <m> \le x _ 0 </m> modulo which there 's a solution . in more detail , if <m> ( * ) </m> does not have a solution in <m> \mathbb { C } ^ n </m> , then the number <m> \pi _ S ( x _ 0 ) </m> of primes <m> p </m> such that there is a witness <m> \bar { w } = ( \bar { x } _ 1 , \cdots , \bar { x } _ n ) \in \mathbb { Z } ^ n </m> with <m> f _ 1 [ \bar { x } _ 1 , \cdots , \bar { x } _ n ] = \cdots = f _ m [ \bar { x } _ 1 , \cdots , \bar { x } _ n ] = 0 </m> modulo <m> p </m> is <m> \le A </m> for some number <m> A </m> exponential in <m> m , n , d </m> . however . if <m> ( * ) </m> does have a solution in <m> \mathbb { C } ^ n </m> , then -LRB- assuming the generalized riemann hypothesis -RRB- , the number <m> \pi _ S ( x _ 0 ) </m> is <m> \ge B = 8 A \text { l o g } ( A + 3 ) </m> . in general , although there may be a finite number of primes modulo which <m> ( * ) </m> is satisfiable if <m> ( * ) </m> is not satisfiable in <m> \mathbb { C } </m> , and an infinite number of primes modulo which <m> ( * ) </m> is satisfied if <m> ( * ) </m> is satisfiable in <m> \mathbb { C } </m> , in the latter case the density of primes modulo which a solution exists , by the chebotariv density theorem , is <m> \frac { | C | } { | G | } </m> , where <m> G </m> is the galois group of <m> f </m> and <m> C </m> is the set of permutations <m> g \in G </m> which have at least one fixed point . one of koiran 's insights is that because there 's enough of a gap <m> A </m> between and <m> B </m> , he can use universal hashing for his algorithm . specifically , the first algorithm that koiran proposes is to utilize a good random hash <m> H </m> onto a set of size <m> B </m> to find a prime <m> \hat { p } </m> such that both <m> H ( \hat { p } ) = 0 </m> and there 's a witness <m> \hat { w } = ( \hat { x } _ 1 , \cdots , \hat { x _ n } ) </m> with <m> f _ 1 [ \hat { x } _ 1 , \cdots , \hat { x } _ n ] = \cdots = f _ m [ \hat { x } _ 1 , \cdots , \hat { x } _ n ] = 0 </m> modulo <m> \hat { p } </m> . the two requirements - finding a <m> \hat { p } </m> that hashes on to <m> 0 </m> , and a <m> \hat { w } </m> such that <m> ( * ) </m> is satisfied modulo <m> \hat { p } </m> - seem difficult independent problems . i can look for a prime whose hash is <m> 0 </m> , and then i have to find a witness to <m> ( * ) </m> modulo that prime . although hashing a prime is easy , finding a prime that hashes onto <m> 0 </m> is exponentially difficult , and further still , finding a witness such that <m> ( * ) </m> is satisfied modulo the hashed prime feels like solving a difficult <m> \mathsf { S A T } </m> problem . thus , the complexity seems like two exponentially difficult problems . however , i suspect that this is , in a certain sense , reversible - that is , i can guess a witness prior to hashing .
i was beginning to read bruhat and tits article groupes reductifs sur un corps locale and was confused on a point in the beginning of the section on affine root systems . <m> \mathbf { A } </m> is a finite dimensional real affine space with corresponding vector space <m> ^ v \mathbf { A } </m> , and we are given a locally finite collection <m> \mathfrak H </m> of hyperplanes in <m> \mathbf { A } </m> . the choice of a scalar product on <m> ^ v \mathbf { A } </m> gives us a notion of orthogonality in <m> \mathbf { A } </m> . about each hyperplane <m> L </m> , we then have an orthogonal reflection <m> s _ L </m> in <m> \mathbf { A } </m> about <m> L </m> . the group <m> W </m> generated by all the <m> s _ L </m> , with the discrete topology , is assumed to act properly on <m> \mathbf { A } </m> , and <m> \mathfrak H </m> is assumed to be closed under the action of <m> W </m> .

this question concerns a set-theoretic aspect that i found interesting in the recent question asked by user nick r. , namely , is <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 3 \setminus \mathbb { Q } ^ 3 </m> simply connected ? he had asked whether <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 3 </m> remains simply connected after deleting a countable set of points , such as the collection of rational points <m> \mathbb { Q } ^ 3 </m> . that question was answered affirmatively by martin m. w. my question is , can we do better ? specifically , i want to understand , in general context where the continuum may be very large , exactly how many points we may freely delete from <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 3 </m> , whilst remaining simply connected . what is the fewest number of points that we must delete from <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 3 </m> in order to make it no longer simply connected ? let us define the simply connected deletion number , <m> \delta </m> , to be the smallest cardinality of a subset <m> A \subset \mathbb { R } ^ 3 </m> , such that the complement <m> \mathbb { R } ^ 3 \setminus A </m> is no longer simply connected . martin 's answer to the earlier question shows that deleting any countable number of points preserves the simply connected property , and so the simply connected deletion number is definitely uncountable , at least <m> \omega _ 1 </m> . and since it is clearly at most the continuum , the question is settled if the continuum hypothesis holds . like all other cardinal characteristics of the continuum , this number is more interesting when the continuum hypothesis fails . in a comment , i had suggested that martin 's argument suggested that the simply connected deletion number should be at least as large as cov <m> ( \cal { M } ) </m> , the covering number of the meager ideal , which is the fewest number of meager sets whose union is the whole space . my reason for suggesting this was that as far as i understand martin 's answer -LRB- which i admit is imperfectly -RRB- , he is proposing that for any one point <m> x </m> , there is a comeager set of homotopies that avoids <m> x </m> . so in order to avoid all the points in a set <m> P </m> , we need to know that the intersection of <m> | P | </m> many comeager sets in his space of homotopies is nonempty . this is the same as knowing that the unions of <m> | P | </m> many meager sets -LRB- the complements -RRB- is not the whole space of homotopies , in order that there is at least one desired homotopy that avoids every point in <m> P </m> . if this is right , then we would deduce that the simply connected deletion number is at least cov <m> ( \cal { M } ) </m> , provided that the covering number for meager sets in his space was the same as for our other more familiar spaces . -LRB- if someone could explain and confirm this inequality in greater detail , please post an answer ! i would want to see more details than martin had provided about the space of homotopies . -RRB- question . what is the simply connected deletion number exactly ? is it consistent that this number is strictly less than the continuum ? is it necessarily the continuum ? how does it relate to the other standard cardinal characteristics of the continuum ? what is the value under martin 's axiom ? is it equal to cov -LRB- <m> \cal { M } </m> -RRB- ? can it be strictly larger than cov <m> ( \cal { M } ) </m> ?
the derivative of the floquet transform equals the floquet tranform of the derivative . but can the floquet tranform of the derivative of a function <m> f ( r ) </m> can be expressed in terms of the floquet tranform of the function <m> f ( r ) </m> ? so , is there a relation between <m> ( U \frac { \partial f } { \partial r } ) ( r ) </m> and <m> ( U f ) ( r ) </m> -LRB- like there is for the fourier transform , i.e. <m> ( F \frac { \partial f } { \partial r } ) ( r ) = i ( F f ) ( r ) </m> ? many thanks in advance ! jeff
let <m> F \subseteq k ( x _ 1 , \dots , x _ n ) </m> be a subfield with <m> k \subseteq F </m> . i know that <m> F = k ( \psi _ 1 , \dots , \psi _ r ) </m> for rational functions <m> \psi _ i \in k ( x _ 1 , \dots , x _ n ) </m> . i 'm interested in the intersection <m> F \cap k [ x _ 1 , \dots , x _ n ] </m> . can i always write this intersection as <m> k ( f _ 1 , \dots , f _ m ) \cap k [ x _ 1 , \dots , x _ n ] </m> for polynomials <m> f _ j \in k [ x _ 1 , \dots , x _ n ] </m> -LRB- instead of rational functions -RRB- ? background : hilbert 's 14th problem asks about the finite generation of this intersection . but in his original formulation , hilbert starts out by taking polynomials <m> f _ 1 , \dots , f _ m </m> in <m> n </m> variables , and then asks if the intersection <m> k ( f _ 1 , \dots , f _ m ) \cap k [ x _ 1 , \dots , x _ n ] </m> -LRB- the relatively integer functions -RRB- is finitely generated . the modern formulation of the problem takes any subfield <m> F </m> as above and intersects it with the polynomial ring . so i thought there should be a `` way back '' from the modern formulation to hilbert 's original one . that is , if i can decide if <m> k ( f _ 1 , \dots , f _ m ) \cap k [ x _ 1 , \dots , x _ n ] </m> is finitely generated for arbitrary polynomials <m> f _ i </m> , i hope i should be able to decide if <m> F \cap k [ x _ 1 , \dots , x _ n ] </m> is finitely generated for an arbitrary <m> F </m> . but i do n't see a way to break it down to polynomials . i guess that this is a very simple problem , but just ca n't wrap my head around it . i tried asking on mse , but there has n't been an answer yet , which may be because i did n't make it really clear what i wanted . thanks for your help in advance !
i asked this question on math stack exchange some time ago and a similar question recently appeared regarding <m> L ^ 1 </m> instead see here this has prompted me to bring it to this community in the hopes of getting an answer , partial answer , or even perhaps literature that addresses this question . text from initial post below . original post .
given a semigroup <m> S </m> , a subset <m> I </m> is called an ideal iff for every <m> s \in S </m> we have <m> s I , I s \subseteq I </m> . further we set <m> s \le _ { \mathcal J } t : \Leftrightarrow S s S \cup \{ s \} \subseteq S t S \cup \{ t \} </m> i.e. the principal ideals generated are contained in each other . this gives a preorder , and by passing to the partial order by the usual identification <m> s \equiv _ { \mathcal J } t </m> iff <m> s \le _ { \mathcal J } t </m> and <m> t \le _ { \mathcal J } s </m> we get an equivalence relation , whose equivalence classes are called <m> \mathcal J </m> - classes , a particular green relation . for a given ideal <m> I </m> we have for <m> s \in I </m> that <m> [ s ] _ { \equiv _ { \mathcal J } } \subseteq S s S \cup \{ s \} \subseteq I </m> , hence every ideal is a disjoint union of equivalence classes . is there any useful characterisation of when an arbitrary union of equivalence classes forms an ideal ?
if <m> p = 4 k + 1 </m> , then p has the form <m> a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 </m> . my question : is there <m> p = k n + h </m> with <m> g c d ( k , h ) = 1 </m> , such that for significant <m> k </m> and <m> h </m> , and <m> n _ 1 </m> , <m> p = a ^ { n _ 1 } + b ^ { n _ 1 } </m> -LRB- <m> k > 2 </m> , <m> h > 1 </m> , <m> n _ 1 > 2 </m> -RRB- .

short version : what can we say about subsets of <m> \omega _ 2 </m> which - in a generic extension where <m> \omega _ 2 </m> is the new <m> \omega _ 1 </m> - contain a club ? we could of course generalize beyond <m> \omega _ 2 </m> , but already the questions seem hard .
i have read definitions in my pde book as follows : if <m> M </m> is a smooth paracompact manifold , the space of all linear functional on <m> C ^ \infty ( M ) </m> is denoted by <m> E ' </m> and the space of all linear functional on <m> C ^ \infty _ 0 ( M ) </m> is denoted by <m> D ' </m> . i have already known the topologies of these 4 spaces when <m> M </m> is <m> R ^ n </m> , can you give me the general description of the topologies of these spaces ?
it 's well known that <m> S L _ 2 ( \widehat { \mathbb { Z } } ) </m> contains <m> S L _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> as a dense and finitely generated subgroup . however , <m> G L _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> is not dense in <m> G L _ 2 ( \widehat { \mathbb { Z } } ) </m> , since <m> G L _ 2 ( \mathbb { Z } ) </m> is contained in the closed subgroup of matrices with determinant <m> \pm 1 </m> , which is very far from the entirety of <m> G L _ 2 ( \widehat { \mathbb { Z } } ) </m> -LRB- whose determinant map surjects onto <m> \widehat { \mathbb { Z } } ^ \times </m> -RRB- is there a finitely generated dense subgroup of <m> G L _ 2 ( \widehat { \mathbb { Z } } ) </m> ?
i wanted to test my understanding of the atiyah-patodi-singer theorem by studying flat bundles on <m> T ^ 3 </m> explicitly , and miserably failed . namely , i computed the eta invariant explicitly for flat bundles with known chern-simons invariants -LRB- taken from borel-friedman-morgan -RRB- but they did n't agree . could you point out where i did mistakes in the following computation ? first , let 's take an orthonormal metric on <m> T ^ 3 </m> , and consider the standard dirac operator <m> D _ \alpha </m> on the spin bundle tensored by the flat line bundle <m> L _ \alpha </m> , whose holonomies <m> ( \alpha _ 1 , \alpha _ 2 , \alpha _ 3 ) </m> around three generators of <m> T ^ 3 </m> are all <m> \alpha _ { i } \in \{ \pm 1 \} </m> . the eigenvalues of <m> D _ \alpha </m> can be easily found by explicit computation : <m> \pm \sqrt { n _ 1 ^ 2 + n _ 2 ^ 2 + n _ 3 ^ 2 } </m> where <m> n _ i </m> is in <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> -LRB- in <m> \mathbb { Z } + 1 / 2 </m> -RRB- if <m> \alpha _ i = + 1 </m> -LRB- if <m> \alpha _ i = - 1 </m> -RRB- . from this we see that <m> \eta _ \alpha ( s ) = 0 </m> and in particular <m> \eta _ \alpha ( 0 ) = 0 </m> , and <m> \xi _ \alpha : = \frac { h _ \alpha + \eta _ \alpha ( 0 ) } 2 </m> is 1 or 0 iff <m> ( \alpha _ 1 , \alpha _ 2 , \alpha _ 3 ) = ( + 1 , + 1 , + 1 ) </m> or not . now , let 's consider two flat <m> S p i n ( n ) </m> bundles on <m> T ^ 3 </m> . the first one <m> P _ 1 </m> is the trivial one with trivial holonomy , and the second one <m> P _ 2 </m> has the holonomies -LRB- when projected to <m> S O ( n ) </m> -RRB- <m> g _ 1 = d i a g ( + , + , + , + , - , - , - , - , + , + , \ldots , + ) </m> <m> g _ 2 = d i a g ( + , + , - , - , + , + , - , - , + , + , \ldots , + ) </m> <m> g _ 3 = d i a g ( + , - , + , - , + , - , + , - , + , + , \ldots , + ) </m> around <m> T ^ 3 </m> . in borel-firedman-morgan it was shown that the difference of the cs invariants of <m> P _ 2 </m> and <m> P _ 1 </m> is <m> 1 / 2 </m> -LRB- where the cs is defined mod 1 -RRB- . -LRB- for those who are n't familiar with b-f-m , the moduli space of flat <m> S p i n ( n ) </m> connections on <m> T ^ 3 </m> has two components , and these two are representatives from each . -RRB- now , take an irreducible representation <m> V </m> of <m> S p i n ( n ) </m> , and consider the dirac operator <m> D _ { V , i } </m> on the spin bundle of <m> T ^ 3 </m> tensored with <m> P _ i \times _ { S p i n ( n ) } V </m> . the atiyah-patodi-singer theorem says that <m> \frac { \xi _ { V , 1 } - \xi _ { V , 2 } } { 2 k ( V ) } = C S ( P _ 1 ) - C S ( P _ 2 ) </m> mod 1 , where <m> k ( V ) </m> is the quadratic casimir of <m> V </m> normalized so that <m> k ( a d j ) </m> is the dual coxeter number . so , i wanted to check this . when <m> V </m> is the <m> n </m> - dimensional defining representation of <m> S O ( n ) </m> , the <m> \xi _ { V , i } </m> can be found by summing <m> \xi _ \alpha </m> computed above , by writing <m> P _ 2 \times _ { S p i n ( n ) } V = L _ 1 \oplus L _ 2 \oplus \cdots \oplus L _ { n } . </m> <m> L _ 2 </m> ... <m> L _ 8 </m> give <m> \xi _ \alpha = 1 </m> , while the others give zero . furthermore , <m> k ( V ) = 1 </m> . then we see <m> 7 / 2 = 1 / 2 </m> mod 1 , so far so good . now i have a problem when we take <m> W </m> to be the adjoint representation . we have <m> P _ 2 \times _ { S p i n ( n ) } W = \bigoplus _ { i < j } L _ i \otimes L _ j </m> and again i can easily compute the <m> \xi </m> invariants . for definiteness , take <m> n = 8 </m> . then every choice <m> i < j </m> gives <m> \xi _ \alpha = 1 </m> . and <m> k ( W ) = k ( a d j ) = 6 </m> . so i seem to have <m> \frac { 2 8 } { 1 2 } = 1 / 2 </m> mod 1 , which is not true .
i am a physics student , recently i read a paper using homotopy <m> \pi _ 4 ( S U ( 2 ) ) = Z _ 2 </m> , i guess mathematicians have some visualization or explanation of this result . so i come here ask for help . cross-post from https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/46284/homotopy-pi-4su2-z-2
i asked the following question in mse , but i 've got no answer so far . let <m> K </m> be an algebraic number field . let <m> A </m> be the ring of integers in <m> K </m> . let <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> be a prime ideal of <m> K </m> . let <m> A _ \mathfrak { p } </m> be the localization of <m> A </m> at <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> . let <m> A _ \mathfrak { p } ^ \times </m> be the group of invertible elements of <m> A _ \mathfrak { p } </m> . elements of <m> A _ \mathfrak { p } ^ \times </m> are called <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> - units . let <m> I </m> be a non-zero ideal of <m> A </m> . an element <m> \alpha </m> of <m> A </m> is called an <m> I </m> - unit if <m> \alpha </m> is a <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> - unit for every prime divisor <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> of <m> I </m> . let <m> L </m> be a finite etension of <m> K </m> . let <m> B </m> be the ring of integers in <m> L </m> . let <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> be a prime ideal of <m> K </m> . let <m> \lambda > 0 </m> be an integer . let <m> \alpha \in A _ \mathfrak { p } ^ \times </m> . if there exists a <m> \mathfrak { p } B </m> - unit <m> \Gamma \in L </m> such that <m> \frac { \alpha } { N _ { L / K } ( \Gamma ) } \equiv 1 </m> -LRB- mod <m> \mathfrak { p } ^ \lambda A _ \mathfrak { p } ) </m> , <m> \alpha </m> is called a norm residue of <m> \mathfrak { p } ^ \lambda </m> with respect to <m> L / K </m> . such <m> \alpha </m> form a subgroup of <m> A _ \mathfrak { p } ^ \times </m> . this group is called the norm residue group of <m> \mathfrak { p } ^ \lambda </m> with respect to <m> L / K </m> . we denote this group by <m> \mathfrak { N } ( \mathfrak { p } ^ \lambda ) </m> . the following proposition is crucial in the classical proof of the global class field theory . the usual proof uses <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> - adic completion . proposition let <m> L </m> be a finite cyclic extension of <m> K </m> . let <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> be a prime ideal of <m> K </m> . let <m> e </m> be the ramification index of <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> in <m> L </m> . then there exists an integer <m> \lambda _ 0 > 0 </m> such that <m> [ A _ \mathfrak { p } ^ \times \colon \mathfrak { N } ( \mathfrak { p } ^ \lambda ) ] = e </m> for all integer <m> \lambda \ge \lambda _ 0 </m> . my question how do we prove this without using the <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> - adic completion ? remark i think hasse 's `` bericht '' proves this without using the <m> \mathfrak { p } </m> - adic completion . however , my german is not good .
let <m> f : \mathbb { S } ^ 2 \to \mathbb { S } ^ 2 </m> with degree <m> d </m> . it is well known that the induced map <m> f _ \ast : \pi _ 3 ( \mathbb { S } ^ 2 ) = \mathbb { Z } \to \pi _ 3 ( \mathbb { S } ^ 2 ) = \mathbb { Z } </m> is given by multiplication by <m> d ^ 2 </m> . but , <m> \mathbb { S } ^ 2 = \mathbb { C } P ^ 1 </m> and <m> [ \mathbb { C } P ^ n , \mathbb { C } P ^ n ] = \mathbb { Z } </m> for <m> n \geq 1 </m> and for any <m> f : \mathbb { C } P ^ n \to \mathbb { C } P ^ n </m> determined by <m> d \in \mathbb { Z } </m> the induced map <m> f _ \sharp : H _ { 2 k } ( \mathbb { C } P ^ n ) = \mathbb { Z } \to H _ { 2 k } ( \mathbb { C } P ^ n ) = \mathbb { Z } </m> is given by multiplication by <m> d ^ k </m> for <m> 1 \leq k \leq n </m> . question : is it true that the map <m> f _ \ast : \pi _ { 2 n + 1 } ( \mathbb { C } P ^ n ) = \mathbb { Z } \to \pi _ { 2 n + 1 } ( \mathbb { C } P ^ n ) = \mathbb { Z } </m> is determined by multiplication by <m> d ^ { n + 1 } </m> ?

let <m> R = \frac { \mathbb { Q } [ t ] } { ( t ^ 2 - 1 ) } </m> ; trivially , <m> R </m> is not an integral domain , since <m> ( \overline { t - 1 } ) ( \overline { t + 1 } ) = \overline { t ^ 2 - 1 } = \overline { 0 } </m> .
this sounds like something that must have been answered long ago , but for some reason i can find nothing on it in the internet . -LRB- there has been lots of recent activity in diagonal covariants , related to the <m> n ! </m> conjecture , but invariants seem to have become a stepchild in this process . -RRB- let <m> k </m> be a field of characteristic <m> 0 </m> . let <m> n \in \mathbb N </m> . the group <m> S _ n \times S _ n </m> acts on the polynomial ring <m> k \left [ X _ 1 , X _ 2 , . . . , X _ n , Y _ 1 , Y _ 2 , . . . , Y _ n \right ] </m> by <m> \left ( \sigma , \tau \right ) \left ( P \right ) = P \left ( X _ { \sigma \left ( 1 \right ) } , X _ { \sigma \left ( 2 \right ) } , . . . , X _ { \sigma \left ( n \right ) } , Y _ { \tau \left ( 1 \right ) } , Y _ { \tau \left ( 2 \right ) } , . . . , Y _ { \tau \left ( n \right ) } \right ) </m> . thus , the symmetric group <m> S _ n </m> also acts on <m> k \left [ X _ 1 , X _ 2 , . . . , X _ n , Y _ 1 , Y _ 2 , . . . , Y _ n \right ] </m> due to the diagonal embedding <m> S _ n \to S _ n \times S _ n </m> . since the action of <m> S _ n </m> is not generated by pseudoreflections , it follows from the converse of the chevalley-shephard-todd theorem that <m> k \left [ X _ 1 , X _ 2 , . . . , X _ n , Y _ 1 , Y _ 2 , . . . , Y _ n \right ] </m> is not a free <m> k \left [ X _ 1 , X _ 2 , . . . , X _ n , Y _ 1 , Y _ 2 , . . . , Y _ n \right ] ^ { S _ n } </m> - module . but it is easy to see that <m> k \left [ X _ 1 , X _ 2 , . . . , X _ n , Y _ 1 , Y _ 2 , . . . , Y _ n \right ] </m> is a free <m> k \left [ X _ 1 , X _ 2 , . . . , X _ n , Y _ 1 , Y _ 2 , . . . , Y _ n \right ] ^ { S _ n \times S _ n } </m> - module of rank <m> n ! ^ 2 </m> . question : is <m> k \left [ X _ 1 , X _ 2 , . . . , X _ n , Y _ 1 , Y _ 2 , . . . , Y _ n \right ] ^ { S _ n } </m> a free <m> k \left [ X _ 1 , X _ 2 , . . . , X _ n , Y _ 1 , Y _ 2 , . . . , Y _ n \right ] ^ { S _ n \times S _ n } </m> - module ?
let <m> \overline { \mathcal { M } } _ { g , n } </m> be the deligne-mumford moduli space of stable algebraic curves . i would like to know which rational cohomology classes or at least which tautological classes on <m> \overline { \mathcal { M } } _ { g , n } </m> vanish when restricted to the divisor <m> \delta _ { \mathrm { i r r } } </m> of curves with one non-separating node . an example would be the top hodge class <m> \lambda _ g \in H ^ { 2 g } ( \overline { \mathcal { M } } _ { g , n } ) </m> . i know that arbarello and cornalba proved here that <m> i ^ * : H ^ * ( \overline { \mathcal { M } } _ { g , n } , \mathbb { Q } ) \to H ^ * ( \overline { \mathcal { M } } _ { g - 1 , n + 2 } , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> is injective for <m> k \leq 2 g - 2 </m> for <m> g \leq 7 </m> and for <m> k \leq g + 5 </m> for <m> g \geq 7 </m> . i also understand that it 's probably irrealistic to expect an explicit and general description of <m> \ker i ^ * </m> , either in cohomology or the tautological ring . so here is a perhaps more approachable question : is <m> \ker i ^ * \subset R H ^ * ( \overline { \mathcal { M } } _ { g , n } , \mathbb { Q } ) </m> strictly bigger than the ideal generated by <m> \lambda _ g </m> ? i guess so ! if yes , can i get some examples , maybe something working in any genus ? for instance , what is there in cohomological degree between the bounds of arbarello and cornalba and <m> 2 g </m> ?
this might be the most stupid question i am ever posting here : i am asking for a proof or a counterexample to a problem i proposed on mathlinks long ago . let <m> G </m> be a bipartite graph , i. e. , a graph such that the set of its vertices is the union of two sets <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> , and each edge of the graph <m> G </m> connects a vertex from <m> A </m> with a vertex from <m> B </m> . for every subset <m> U </m> of <m> A </m> and every integer <m> k </m> , let <m> N _ { k } \left ( U \right ) </m> denote the set of all vertices from <m> B </m> which have at least <m> k </m> neighbours in the set <m> U </m> . assume that <m> \left | A \right | = \left | B \right | </m> . some matchings of <m> G </m> are called disjoint if there is no edge common to two or more of these matchings . let <m> m </m> be a positive integer . prove or disprove that the graph <m> G </m> has <m> m </m> disjoint perfect matchings if and only if the inequality <m> \left | N _ { 1 } \left ( U \right ) \right | + \left | N _ { 2 } \left ( U \right ) \right | + . . . + \left | N _ { m } \left ( U \right ) \right | \geq m \left | U \right | </m> holds for every subset <m> U </m> of <m> A </m> . note that probably the assumption <m> \left | A \right | = \left | B \right | </m> can be dropped if we replace `` perfect matchings '' by '' <m> A </m> - complete matchings '' -LRB- i. e. , every vertex of <m> A </m> is matched in every of these matchings -RRB- . also note that the `` only if '' direction is easy . finally , of course , for <m> m = 1 </m> , this is hall 's marriage theorem . the fact that i have posted the above problem on mathlinks in 2007 speaks for it being easy , but the fact that i have always been too lazy to write up my solution speaks for it being wrong . i have tried the obvious induction approach now , but i fail to obtain a reasonable inequality for <m> m - 1 </m> instead of <m> m </m> after deleting the first perfect matching . any ideas ?
for a projective variety <m> X </m> over an algebraically closed field of characteristic <m> 0 </m> , why the condition <m> \mathrm { C H } _ 0 ( X ) \simeq \mathbb Z </m> does not imply that <m> X </m> is rationally -LRB- chain -RRB- connected ?
let <m> G </m> be a finite group and let <m> g \in G </m> be an element of order <m> p q </m> , where <m> p < q </m> are prime numbers . denote by <m> g ^ G </m> the conjugacy class of <m> g </m> in <m> G </m> . under which conditions does the following hold ? : <m> | ( g ^ p ) ^ G | = | ( g ^ q ) ^ G | = | ( g ^ { q p } ) ^ G | </m> -- is it possible that this happens ?
this is a question about the action of the formal tori defined in recent papers of andreatta , iovita and pilloni . the notations are heavy , so i will follow the paper triple product p-adic l-functions associated to finite slope p-adic families of modular forms . at the end of the proof of thm . 4.6 , when considering the action of the formal tori <m> I ^ \mathrm { e x t } </m> on certain element in <m> \mathbb { W } </m> , the authors wrote : by density , we only need to consider the action of <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p ^ \times </m> . what is the reason lying behind for the density result ? it seems <m> \mathbb { Z } _ p ^ \times </m> is in general not dense in <m> I ^ \mathrm { e x t } </m> in a naive sense . would anyone help me understand this ? thanks very much .
if <m> G </m> is a discrete or topological group , <m> G </m> is a closed subgroup of <m> E G </m> , and normal iff <m> G </m> is abelian , according to segal , cohomology of topological groups , symposia mathematica iv -LRB- 1970 -RRB- -LRB- a reference i found from two answers by chris schommer-pries : classifying space of a group extension and good functorial model for bg -RRB- . hence for <m> G </m> not abelian , <m> G </m> is not normal in <m> E G </m> , hence <m> B G = E G / G </m> is not a group . on the other hand , we also learn from segal that the reason <m> E G </m> is a group is that the universal bundle functor <m> E </m> is monoidal with respect to the cartesian monoidal structure . any monoidal functor takes group objects in one category to group objects in another simply by functoriality . but the classifying space functor <m> B </m> is also monoidal -LRB- see good functorial model for bg or peter may 's answer at group structure on eilenberg-maclane spaces -RRB- . hence <m> B G </m> should be a group ?
consider <m> G = S O ( 2 n ) </m> and <m> K = U ( n ) </m> . <m> ( G , K ) </m> is a symmetric pair . i 'm interested in -LRB- zonal -RRB- spherical functions on <m> G / K </m> which are matrix elements with respect to <m> K </m> - fixed vectors in irreducible representations of <m> G </m> .
we know that <m> B O ( 1 ) = \mathbb { R } P ^ \infty </m> has closed , finite-dimensional manifold approximations <m> \mathbb { R } P ^ 1 \subset \mathbb { R } P ^ 2 \subset \cdots . </m> similarly <m> B O ( 2 ) </m> can be approximated by closed , finite-dimensional manifolds , as follows . there is a fibration <m> B S O ( 2 ) \to B O ( 2 ) \to B O ( 1 ) , </m> where the projection is given by the determinant . both the base space <m> B O ( 1 ) = \mathbb { R } P ^ \infty </m> and the fibre <m> B S O ( 2 ) = \mathbb { C } P ^ \infty </m> can be approximated by finite-dimensional manifolds . hence the total space <m> B O ( 2 ) </m> can be approximated by the dold manifolds <m> P ( n , m ) = \mathbb { C } P ^ n \times _ { \mathbb { Z } / 2 } S ^ m , </m> where the generator of <m> \mathbb { Z } / 2 </m> acts on the sphere by <m> - 1 </m> and on <m> \mathbb { C } P ^ n </m> by complex conjugation .
here we consider the fractional sobolev spaces and suppose <m> u </m> is a vector function in <m> \mathbb R ^ 2 </m> . for <m> q > 2 </m> , is the following always true ? <m> \Vert D u \Vert _ { L ^ { \infty } ( \mathbb R ^ 2 ) } \leq C \Vert D u \Vert ^ { 1 - \alpha } _ { L ^ { q } ( \mathbb R ^ 2 ) } \Vert D ^ { \beta } u \Vert ^ { \alpha } _ { L ^ { q } ( \mathbb R ^ 2 ) } </m> where we can calculate the relation between <m> \alpha </m> , <m> \beta </m> and <m> q </m> by scaling .
let <m> G </m> be a nontrivial finite group . given <m> n \in \mathbb { Z } _ { \geq 1 } </m> , let <m> G ^ n </m> be the cartesian product of <m> n </m> copies of <m> G </m> . further let <m> S \subseteq G ^ n </m> be a generating set of <m> G ^ n </m> . question : do we always have <m> | S | \geq n </m> ?
for any set <m> X </m> , let <m> [ X ] ^ 2 = \big \{ \{ x , y \} : x \neq y \in X \big \} </m> . let <m> f : [ \omega ] ^ 2 \to \{ 0 , 1 \} </m> be a function . the principal goal is to find a partition of <m> \omega </m> such that if <m> m \neq n \in \omega </m> are in the same block of the partition , then <m> f ( \{ m , n \} ) = 0 </m> , and if <m> m , n </m> are not in the same block , then <m> f ( \{ m , n \} ) = 1 </m> . it is easy to see that given <m> f : [ \omega ] ^ 2 \to \{ 0 , 1 \} </m> it is not always possible to find such a `` perfect '' partition that meets the requirement above . so for any partition <m> P </m> of <m> \omega </m> we define the collection of wrong members of <m> [ \omega ] ^ 2 </m> , denoted by <m> W _ P \subseteq [ \omega ] ^ 2 </m> in the following way .
let <m> C </m> be a smooth projective irreducible curve over <m> \mathbb C </m> . let <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> be distinct points of <m> C </m> . we say that <m> f </m> is totally ramified at a point <m> p </m> if the ramification index of <m> p </m> equals <m> \deg ( f ) </m> . does <m> C </m> admit a finite map <m> f \colon C \to \mathbb P ^ 1 </m> which is totally ramified at <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> ?
let <m> \ell _ p ^ n </m> be the <m> n </m> - dimensional real or complex <m> \ell _ p </m> - space and let <m> \mathscr { B } ( \ell _ p ^ n ) </m> be the space of matrices on <m> \ell _ p ^ n </m> endowed with the operator norm . i am looking for any references which give -LRB- reasonable -RRB- estimates for the banach-mazur distance between <m> \mathscr { B } ( \ell _ p ^ n ) </m> and <m> \ell _ p ^ { n ^ 2 } </m> . i am also wondering whether there is a banach space <m> E </m> with a schauder basis <m> ( e _ n ) </m> and corresponding basis projections <m> ( P _ n ) </m> which satisfies <m> \sup _ { n \in \mathbb { N } } \; d _ { { \rm B M } } \big ( \mathscr { B } ( P _ n ( E ) ) ) , P _ { n ^ 2 } ( E ) \big ) = \infty . </m>
i am trying to classify all modules of length <m> 4 </m> over the ring <m> A = \mathbb C [ x , y ] </m> , supported at the origin <m> 0 \in \mathbb C ^ 2 </m> , up to -LRB- <m> A </m> - linear -RRB- isomorphism . let <m> \mathfrak m = ( x , y ) </m> be the ideal of the origin and <m> k \simeq \mathbb C </m> the residue field . here is what i found so far :
let <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> be two <m> n \times n </m> matrices with entries in <m> \mathbb Z _ p </m> , the <m> p </m> - adic integers . is it true that <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> are conjugate iff they 're conjugate over <m> \mathbb Q _ p </m> and over <m> \mathbb F _ p </m> ?
there are two ways to define <m> A _ \infty </m> structures . the elementary one seems rather intuitive when i think of higher homotopies . i.e. an <m> A _ \infty </m> structure on a <m> \mathbb { Z } </m> - graded vector <m> A </m> space is a sequence of maps <m> ( m _ n ) _ { n \in \mathbb { N } } </m> , where <m> m _ n : A ^ { \otimes n } \to A </m> is of degree <m> n - 2 </m> , satisfying the <m> A _ \infty </m> - relations : <m> \sum _ { r + s + t = n - 1 } ( - 1 ) ^ { r + s t } m _ n \circ ( i d ^ { \otimes r } \otimes m _ s \otimes i d ^ { \otimes s } ) = 0 . </m> this definition is then usually `` restated in a more efficient way '' . for example , in keller 's introductory paper :
suppose <m> R </m> is a localization of a normal closed point of a variety of dimension <m> n </m> over an algebraically closed field <m> k </m> with maximal ideal <m> \mathfrak { m } </m> . suppose also that the associated graded <m> \operatorname { G r } _ { \mathfrak { m } } R </m> is isomorphic to the degree <m> d </m> veronese subring <m> S _ d </m> of <m> k [ X _ 1 , \ldots , X _ n ] </m> . is this enough to conclude that the completion of <m> R </m> is isomorphic to the completed local ring of <m> S _ d </m> at the origin ? are there counterexamples ?
i am taking a course in descriptive set theory , and the exam is approaching on sunday . in the framework of proving that for an uncountable polish space <m> X </m> the following holds : <m> \Delta ^ 0 _ \alpha ( X ) \subsetneqq \Sigma ^ 0 _ \alpha ( X ) , \Pi ^ 0 _ \alpha ( X ) \subsetneqq \Delta ^ 0 _ \beta ( X ) </m> . we did not only prove that there is a set which is <m> \Sigma ^ 0 _ \alpha \setminus \Pi ^ 0 _ \alpha </m> but also proved that for every uncountable polish space there are no <m> \Delta ^ 0 _ \alpha </m> - universal sets based on any polish space . the proof is very simple that for <m> X </m> there is no universal set based on <m> X </m> itself , as well for <m> \alpha > 2 </m> the proof is quite simple . for <m> \alpha = 2 </m> the proof given to us goes through great lengths in a rather complex proof . is there a rather general and relatively simple statement which does not separate the cases <m> \alpha = 2 </m> and <m> \alpha > 2 </m> ? -LRB- i could not find the general theorem in either kechris nor moschovakis , but only for the case we wish to base the universal set on <m> X </m> -RRB- edit : i am somewhat under the impression that this theorem has not been published before . my teacher claims that it is unlikely that a unified argument will hold for <m> \alpha \ge 2 </m> and separation must be made . i 'm still not 100 % convinced .
i am trying to get a better understanding of `` real '' <m> C ^ * </m> - algebras . i encountered them in the paper d. voiculescu , dual algebraic structures , j. operator theory 17 -LRB- 1987 -RRB- , 85-98 , which cites g.g. kasparov , hilbert <m> C ^ * </m> - modules : theorems of stinespring and voiculescu , j. operator theory , 4 -LRB- 1980 -RRB- , 133-150 . roughly speaking , these `` real '' <m> C ^ * </m> - algebras are complexifications of real <m> C ^ * </m> - algebras . they are defined as complex <m> C ^ * </m> - algebras equipped with an additional antilinear multiplicative involution . i would be grateful for any pointers to additional literature on these algebras . -LRB- the quotation marks and the star in their name make it more tricky to find them with google ... -RRB- .
let <m> S </m> be a smooth surface -LRB- let 's say over an algebraically closed field -RRB- and let <m> D </m> be a smooth divisor in <m> S </m> . let also <m> G </m> be a connected algebraic group . assume that we are given a principal <m> G </m> - bundle <m> { \mathcal F } </m> on <m> S \backslash D </m> . under what conditions can we extend it to all of <m> S </m> ? do i understand correctly , that this is always the case when the derived group <m> [ G , G ] </m> is simply connected ?
let <m> a , b , n </m> be natural numbers such that <m> a ! b ! \mid n ! </m> . i am looking for a -LRB- somehow best -RRB- upper bound of <m> a + b </m> in terms of <m> n </m> -LRB- for large values on <m> n </m> -RRB- . for example it is clear to see that we must have <m> a + b \leq 2 n </m> . but unfortunately i am looking for much smaller bound ! any idea would be helpful .
define <m> f : [ 0 , 1 ] \to [ 0 , 1 ] </m> by <m> f ( 0 ) = 0 </m> , and <m> f ( x ) = \sum \limits _ { r _ n \le x } 2 ^ { - n } </m> with <m> 0 \lt x \le 1 </m> where <m> [ r _ n ] _ { n \in \mathbb { Z ^ + } } = \mathbb { Q } \cap ( 0 , 1 ) </m> . how to show that the derivative <m> f ' ( x ) = 0 </m> a.e. ? i can show this function is increasing and discontinuous at every rational , and how to word on ?
let <m> M </m> be a closed non-haken hyperbolic <m> 3 </m> - manifold . are there two , nonhomotopic , <m> \pi _ 1 </m> - injective closed surfaces in <m> M </m> , and which do not intersect ?
conjecture - no natural number <m> k </m> exists such that :
if <m> n </m> is odd then <m> S ^ { n - 1 } </m> does n't admit a nowhere-vanishing vector field , and if <m> n </m> is even then there does exist one -LRB- hairy ball theorem -RRB- . we can then ask , on <m> S ^ { n - 1 } </m> , what is the maximum number <m> k ( n ) </m> of linearly independent vector fields ? rewriting <m> n = 2 ^ { 4 a + b } ( 2 s + 1 ) </m> , adams computes <m> k ( n ) = 2 ^ b + 8 a - 1 </m> . in particular , on the <m> ( 4 n + 1 ) </m> - spheres , there is only one nowhere-vanishing vector field up to linear-independence , whereas in every other -LRB- odd -RRB- dimension there are more . example : on the circle <m> S ^ 1 </m> there are the vector fields generated by -LRB- counter -RRB- clockwise rotation , but these are the same up to a scalar . this makes sense : i start flowing along this single dimension and then i have to continue flowing in that direction until i come back to my starting point . i tried considering the difference between <m> S ^ 3 </m> and <m> S ^ 5 </m> , which fiber over <m> \mathbb { C } P ^ 1 </m> and <m> \mathbb { C } P ^ 2 </m> respectively . a nowhere-vanishing vector field in both cases is given by taking the standard nowhere-vanishing vector field on the <m> S ^ 1 </m> - fiber . but for <m> S ^ 3 </m> there are three linearly-independent fields -LRB- the <m> i , j , k </m> - directions when representing <m> S ^ 3 </m> as the unit quaternions -- is there a way to see this using the fibration picture ? -RRB- , whereas for some reason <m> S ^ 5 </m> can only admit the one . what can be the differential/topological reasoning behind this ? i.e. is there a down-to-earth way to deduce this result on <m> S ^ { 4 n + 1 } </m> , or for starters , <m> S ^ 5 </m> ? could there possibly be an analogous index theorem going on here , in the same way that the poincare-hopf theorem provides us the hairy ball result ?
the standard universal <m> R </m> - matrix for quantum group algebra <m> U _ { q } \left ( \mathfrak { g } \right ) </m> , where <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> is of finite type , is <m> R _ { q } = e x p \left ( q \sum _ { i , j } \left ( B ^ { - 1 } \right ) _ { i j } H _ { i } \otimes H _ { j } \right ) \prod _ { \beta } e x p _ { q _ { \beta } } \left [ \left ( 1 - q _ { \beta } ^ { - 2 } \right ) E _ { \beta } \otimes F _ { \beta } \right ] </m> where the product is over all the positive roots of <m> \mathfrak { g } </m> , and the order of the terms is such that <m> \beta _ { r } </m> appears to the left of <m> \beta _ { s } </m> if <m> r \ge s </m> -LSB- cp95 , theorem 8.3.9 -RSB- . i conjecture that brading on the borel subalgebra <m> U _ { q } ^ { + } \left ( \mathfrak { g } \right ) \otimes U _ { q } ^ { 0 } \left ( \mathfrak { g } \right ) </m> is determined by the restriction of this universal <m> R </m> - matrix to that subalgebra , and that restriction is <m> R _ { q } = e x p \left ( q \sum _ { i , j } \left ( B ^ { - 1 } \right ) _ { i j } H _ { i } \otimes H _ { j } \right ) </m> indeed , consider the braiding in <m> U _ { q } ^ { + } \left ( \mathfrak { g } \right ) \otimes U _ { q } ^ { 0 } \left ( \mathfrak { g } \right ) </m> . the expressions that define it can include <m> H _ i </m> , <m> E _ \beta </m> , but not <m> F _ \beta </m> . the also have to be consistent with the universal <m> R </m> - matrix for <m> U _ { q } ^ { 0 } \left ( \mathfrak { g } \right ) </m> . since the definition of <m> U _ { q } ^ { + } \left ( \mathfrak { g } \right ) \otimes U _ { q } ^ { 0 } \left ( \mathfrak { g } \right ) </m> is the same as of <m> U _ { q } ^ { 0 } \left ( \mathfrak { g } \right ) </m> except that expressions with <m> F _ \beta </m> are omitted or <m> F _ \beta </m> is considered to be zero as appropriate , the restriction of the universal <m> R </m> - matrix to <m> U _ { q } ^ { + } \left ( \mathfrak { g } \right ) \otimes U _ { q } ^ { 0 } \left ( \mathfrak { g } \right ) </m> is obtained by omitting the terms with <m> F _ \beta </m> / setting <m> F _ \beta </m> to zero , which makes the arguments of the <m> e x p _ { q \beta } </m> 's zero . question how can this argument be improved ? i would appreciate any suggestions or helpful references . reference -LSB- cp95 -RSB- vyjayanthi chari and andrew pressley , a guide to quantum groups , 1st paperback -LRB- with corrections -RRB- ed. , cambridge university press , cambridge , 1995 .
can anyone sum up this series ? <m> f ( z , t ) = \sum _ { m \in \mathbb { Z } } e ^ { - i m ^ 2 t } e ^ { i m z } . </m> in the mathematical sense , each term of this series is of modulus 1 , and the series is not convergent . but , this series is from a physical problem , and the problem is to some extent how to make sense of it . it is actually the propagator of a free particle on a circle .

for a field <m> F </m> let <m> p ( F ) = p </m> if the characteristic of <m> F </m> is a prime <m> p </m> , and <m> p ( F ) = + \infty </m> if <m> F </m> is of characteristic zero . in 2007 i considered the linear extension of the erdos-heilbronn conjecture , and conjectured -LRB- cf. sun and zhao - linear extension of the erdos-heilbronn conjecture -RRB- that , for any nonzero elements <m> \lambda _ 1 , \dotsc , \lambda _ n </m> of a field <m> F </m> with <m> p ( F ) \ne n + 1 </m> and a finite subset <m> A </m> of <m> F </m> we have <m>  </m> a _ 1 , \ dotsc , a _ n <m> a r e d i s t i n c t e l e m e n t s o f </m> a <m>  </m> where <m> \delta = 1 </m> if <m> n = 2 </m> and <m> \lambda _ 1 + \lambda _ 2 = 0 </m> , and <m> \delta = 0 </m> otherwise . motivated by the above as well as question 316142 of mine , here i ask the following question . question : is my following conjecture true ? conjecture . let <m> \lambda _ 1 , \ldots , \lambda _ n \ ( n \ge 3 ) </m> be positive integers with <m> \gcd ( \lambda _ 1 , \ldots , \lambda _ n ) = 1 </m> and <m> \lambda _ { k + 1 } - \lambda _ k \in \{ 0 , 1 \} </m> for all <m> k = 1 , \ldots , n - 1 </m> . let <m> F </m> be a field with <m> p ( F ) > n + 1 </m> . then , for any finite subset <m> A </m> of <m> F </m> with <m> | A | \ge n + \delta _ { n , 3 } </m> we have <m>  </m> a _ 1 , \ dotsc , a _ n <m> a r e d i s t i n c t e l e m e n t s o f </m> a <m>  </m> now let me explain where the lower bound comes from . suppose that <m> A </m> is just the subset <m> \{ 1 , \ldots , m \} </m> of the rational field <m> \mathbb Q </m> . for the set <m>  </m> a _ 1 , \ dotsc , a _ n <m> a r e d i s t i n c t e l e m e n t s o f </m> a <m>  </m> its minimal element should be <m> \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ n \lambda _ k ( n + 1 - k ) </m> , while its maximal element should be <m> \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ n \lambda _ k ( m - n + k ) </m> . note that <m> \biggl \lvert \biggl \{ \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ n \lambda _ k ( n + 1 - k ) , \ \dotsc , \ \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ n \lambda _ k ( m - n + k ) \biggr \} \biggr \rvert \, = ( \lambda _ 1 + \ldots + \lambda _ n ) ( m - n ) + \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { \lfloor n / 2 \rfloor } ( n + 1 - 2 k ) ( \lambda _ { n + 1 - k } - \lambda _ k ) + 1 . </m> if <m> \lambda _ k = k </m> for all <m> k = 1 , \dotsc , n </m> , then <m> \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { \lfloor n / 2 \rfloor } ( n + 1 - 2 k ) ( \lambda _ { n + 1 - k } - \lambda _ k ) = \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { \lfloor n / 2 \rfloor } ( n + 1 - 2 k ) ^ 2 = \frac { n ( n ^ 2 - 1 ) } 6 . </m> any comments are welcome !
hello , my question is related to teichmuller theory . let <m> D </m> be the open unit disk and <m> X = D / { \Gamma } </m> be a hyperbolic riemann surface of the fuchsian group <m> \Gamma </m> . in teichmuller theory , we have the concept of <m> \Gamma </m> - compatible beltrami cofficients <m> \mu </m> on <m> D </m> which satisfy : <m> \mu ( z ) = \mu ( \gamma ( z ) ) . \frac { \bar { \gamma ' ( z ) } } { \gamma ' ( z ) } </m> -LRB- which corresponds to beltrami differential forms on the riemann surface <m> X = D / { \Gamma } </m> . as in the standard literature , denote : <m> M ( \Gamma ) </m> : ={ <m> \Gamma </m> - compatible beltrami coefficients on <m> D </m> -RCB- = -LCB- beltrami differential forms on riemann surface <m> X </m> -RCB- = -LCB- measurable complex-antilinear bundle automorphims/self-maps of <m> T X </m> of sup . norm <m> < 1 </m> -RCB- . here is my question : -LRB- i -RRB- can we have a non-zero <m> \mu \in M ( \Gamma ) </m> such that <m> \mu \in C ^ 0 ( \bar { D } ) </m> , or even <m> C ^ k ( \bar { D } ) </m> ? put in other words , is there a non-zero element in <m> M ( \Gamma ) \cap C ^ 0 ( \bar { D } ) </m> ? note that if such a <m> \mu </m> is constant , then obviously <m> \mu = 0 </m> , so the question is same as asking whether there is a non-constant <m> \mu </m> . i was suspecting that in many cases there might not be any such <m> \mu </m> , because i was thinking the following might be correct , although could n't prove it , so this could be my -LRB- related -RRB- second question : -LRB- ii -RRB- <m> \text { T r u e o r F a l s e ? } </m> let <m> X = D / { \Gamma } </m> be a hyperbolic riemann surface . let <m> z \ne w \in D </m> , fix them . then there is <m> \zeta \in S ^ 1 = \partial { D } </m> such that there are sequences <m> \gamma _ n \in \Gamma , \nu _ n \in \Gamma </m> so that <m> \gamma _ n ( z ) \to \zeta , \nu _ n ( w ) \to \zeta </m> as <m> n \to \infty . </m> if -LRB- ii -RRB- is true , then it partially answers -LRB- i -RRB- , but implies that <m> | \mu | </m> = constant . because if there is a non-absolutely constant <m> \mu \in M ( \Gamma ) \cap C ^ 0 ( \bar { D } ) </m> , then there are <m> z \ne w \in D </m> such that <m> | \mu ( z ) | \ne | \mu ( w ) | </m> . now , as <m> \gamma _ n ( z ) \to \zeta , \nu _ n ( w ) \to \zeta </m> as <m> n \to \infty , </m> and <m> | \mu ( \gamma _ n ( z ) ) | = | \mu ( z ) | </m> , therefore passing to <m> \zeta , n \to \infty </m> , we have boundary values of <m> \mu </m> not matching up at <m> \zeta </m> . any hints/solutions/references will be highly appreciated ! i would be happy if the answer to -LRB- i -RRB- is yes though , because then we might look at the `` smooth '' subset of teichmuller spaces : -LCB- restriction of <m> \mu </m> - quasiconformal maps fixing <m> 1 , - 1 , i </m> to <m> S ^ 1 , \mu \in C ^ 0 ( \bar { D } ) </m> -RCB- , and we might consider its contractibility , complex structure etc. :-RRB-
today it is known that <m> A D </m> -LRB- the axiom of determinacy of games played with integers -RRB- is true in <m> L ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> . has it been proven that this is the only model in which <m> A D </m> is true ? have other models been identified in which <m> A D </m> is true ? of course , i am asking about genuine models , since we can force over <m> L ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> and still keep enough <m> A D </m> . a related question is the following : how different from <m> L ( \mathbb { R } ) </m> is the universe <m> V </m> ? thx .
here , i am considering one of the simplest random dynamical systems that one can consider , and yet i realise that i do not know the answer to one of the most basic questions that one can ask about it ! let <m> \Omega </m> be the set of all continuous functions <m> \omega : \mathbb { R } \to \mathbb { R } </m> satisfying <m> \omega ( 0 ) = 0 </m> . let <m> \mathcal { F } </m> be the smallest <m> \sigma </m> - algebra on <m> \Omega </m> satisfying the requirement that the map <m> \omega \mapsto \omega ( t ) </m> is <m> ( \mathcal { F } , \mathcal { B } ( \mathbb { R } ) ) </m> - measurable for all <m> t \in \mathbb { R } </m> . -LRB- it is known that <m> \mathcal { F } </m> coincides with the borel <m> \sigma </m> - algebra of the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets . -RRB- for any <m> \omega \in \Omega </m> , define <m> \theta \omega \in \Omega </m> by <m> \theta \omega ( t ) = \omega ( t + 1 ) - \omega ( 1 ) </m> for all <m> t \in \mathbb { R } </m> . for each <m> \alpha \in \mathbb { R } </m> , let <m> R _ \alpha : \mathbb { S } ^ 1 \to \mathbb { S } ^ 1 </m> denote the anticlockwise rotation through angle <m> 2 \pi \alpha </m> . define the function
recently malliaris and shelah proved that <m> \mathfrak { p } = \mathfrak { t } </m> -LRB- see : http://math.uchicago.edu/~mem/malliaris-shelah-cst.pdf -RRB- . their results are far more general , however for the specify context of this question what they showed is that if <m> G </m> is an ultrafilter on <m> \omega </m> , then the ultra product <m> \omega ^ \omega / G </m> is a linear order with no <m> ( \kappa , \lambda ) </m> - gaps with <m> \kappa , \lambda < \mathfrak { t } </m> . they can obtain the desired equality combining it with a result of shelah on the existence of a certain type of small gap -LRB- i.e. with both sequences in the gap of size smaller than <m> \mathfrak { t } </m> -RRB- in structures of the form <m> \omega ^ \omega / G </m> in the case <m> \mathfrak { p } < \mathfrak { t } </m> . recall that
there 's already a question -LRB- which got several interesting answers -RRB- asking about examples of the phenomenon of non -LRB- essential -RRB- injectivity of the functor <m> U : A l g \to A n E s p </m> , mapping each algebraic variety to its associated -LRB- reduced -RRB- complex analytic space . i would like to complement that question by asking :
let <m> \mathcal { G } _ { n , \frac { 1 } { 2 } } </m> be the probability space of <m> n \times n </m> matrices over <m> \{ 0 , 1 \} </m> and each entry of the matrix is independently equal to 1 with probability <m> \frac { 1 } { 2 } </m> and equal to 0 otherwise . define a real-valued random variable <m> X </m> : <m> X ( M ) = \prod \limits _ { 1 \leq i , j \leq n } ( \sum \limits _ { k = 1 } ^ n a _ { i k } - \sum \limits _ { k = 1 } ^ n a _ { k j } ) , \ M = ( a _ { i j } ) \in \mathcal { G } _ { n , \frac { 1 } { 2 } } . </m> it is easy to see that <m> E ( X ) = 0 </m> when <m> n </m> is odd . i am interested in the case when <m> n </m> is even . i computed up to <m> n = 2 , 4 , 6 </m> roughly and observed that for most <m> M </m> with no row sum equal to a column sum , <m> X ( M ) > 0 . </m> so i guess <m> E ( X ) > 0 </m> when <m> n </m> is even , is that right ?
i know that if <m> R </m> is noetherian local with a finite module of finite injective dimension , then <m> R </m> is cohen-macaulay .
let <m> V _ n </m> be the standard permutation representation of the symmetric group <m> S _ n </m> , and let <m> \mathbb { S } _ { \lambda } </m> denote the schur functor associated to the partition <m> \lambda </m> . let <m> \lambda </m> range over all partitions of some natural number <m> k </m> . we may ask for the smallest <m> n </m> making the characters of the representations <m> \mathbb { S } _ { \lambda } V _ n </m> linearly independent . a little experimentation indicates that <m> n = k </m> . if instead <m> \lambda </m> ranges over all partitions of natural numbers less than or equal to <m> k </m> , it seems that <m> n = 2 k </m> . are these patterns correct ?
given a local commutative -LRB- commutative only if needed ... -RRB- selfinjective -LRB- non-semisimple -RRB- finite dimensional algebra <m> A </m> over a field <m> K </m> with enveloping algebra <m> A ^ e = A \otimes _ K A ^ { o p } </m> . then <m> E x t _ { A ^ { e } } ^ { 1 } ( A , A ) \neq 0 </m> -LRB- here we might need commutativity ? -RRB- . because of <m> E x t _ { A ^ { e } } ^ { 1 } ( A , A ) \cong \underline { H o m _ { A ^ { e } } } ( \Omega _ { A ^ { e } } ^ { 1 } ( A ) , A ) ) </m> there is a map <m> \Omega _ { A ^ { e } } ^ { 1 } ( A ) \rightarrow A </m> in the stable category representing a nonzero element of <m> E x t _ { A ^ { e } } ^ { 1 } ( A , A ) </m> . question : given a finite dimensional non-projective module <m> M </m> over <m> A </m> , can we tensor a certain such map <m> \Omega _ { A ^ { e } } ^ { 1 } ( A ) \rightarrow A </m> with m to obtain an element <m> \Omega ^ { 1 } ( M ) \rightarrow M </m> in the stable category which represents a nonzero element of <m> E x t _ A ^ { 1 } ( M , M ) </m> ? if the question is too general , we can assume first that <m> A </m> is the group ring of a finite -LRB- commutative -RRB- p-group .
the 6 and 15 dimensional representations of <m> S U ( 3 ) </m> are irreducible . the 90 dimensional tensor product representation <m> 6 \times 1 5 </m> decomposes into a sum of irreducible representations . what factors occur and with what multiplicity ? note : by 6 i mean the 2 index symmetric representation and not its complex conjugate -LRB- which is also 6 dimensional -RRB- . similarly for 15 .
is the canonical height of a non-torsion <m> \mathbb { F } _ q ( T ) </m> - rational point of an elliptic curve over <m> \mathbb { F } _ q ( T ) </m> known or supposed to be bounded from below by an absolute positive number -LRB- or perhaps by a number depending just on <m> q </m> but not on the elliptic curve -RRB- ? the corresponding question for <m> \mathbb { C } ( T ) </m> has a positive answer by the work of hindry and silverman -LRB- invent . math . 93 , 1988 -RRB- , who prove more precisely lang ' conjecture : the height of a non-torsion and non-constant <m> \mathbb { C } ( T ) </m> - rational point is larger than an absolute constant multiple of the degree of the minimal discriminant . however , their proof uses the abc conjecture , which does not hold in unaltered form for <m> \mathbb { F } _ q ( T ) </m> . does the argument go through if we restrict only to elliptic curves whose <m> j </m> - invariant has non-zero derivative ? -LRB- szpiro 's discriminant-conductor inequality holds for such curves with the absolute constant <m> 6 </m> . -RRB- is there any reason -LRB- involving for example some use of the frobenius substitution <m> T \to T ^ p </m> on the parameter producing curves of high szpiro ratio -RRB- that lang 's height conjecture may not hold for <m> \mathbb { F } _ q ( T ) </m> without any restriction ?
let <m> \mathcal { L } _ g </m> be the space of abelian differentials on riemann surfaces of genus <m> g \ge 2 </m> and <m> \mathcal { T H } _ g : = \mathcal { L } _ g / D i f f _ 0 ^ + ( S _ g ) </m> be the teichmuller space of abelian differentials on riemann surfaces as it is defined in this article http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2758v1.pdf by giovanni forni and carlos matheus . let <m> \mathcal { T H } ( k ) </m> be a stratum of <m> \mathcal { T H } _ g </m> . at page 20 they state : `` it is possible to prove that every <m> \omega _ 0 \in \mathcal { T H } ( k ) </m> has an open neighborhood <m> U _ 0 \subset \mathcal { T H } ( k ) </m> such that , after identifying , for all <m> \omega \in U _ 0 </m> , the cohomology <m> H ^ 1 ( M , \Sigma ( \omega ) , \mathbb { C } ) </m> with the fixed complex vector space <m> H ^ 1 ( M , \Sigma ( \omega _ 0 ) , \mathbb { C } ) </m> via the gauss-manin connection -LRB- i.e. , through identification of the integer lattices <m> H ^ 1 ( M , \Sigma ( \omega ) , \mathbb { Z } + i \mathbb { Z } ) </m> and <m> H ^ 1 ( M , \Sigma ( \omega _ 0 ) , \mathbb { Z } + i \mathbb { Z } ) </m> -RRB- , the period map <m> \Theta : U _ 0 \rightarrow H ^ 1 ( M , \Sigma ( \omega _ 0 ) , \mathbb { C } ) </m> that is , the map defined by the formula <m> \Theta ( \omega ) : = ( \gamma \mapsto \int _ \gamma \omega ) \in H o m ( H ^ 1 ( M , \Sigma ( \omega ) , \mathbb { Z } ) ; \mathbb { C } ) \simeq H ^ 1 ( M , \Sigma ( \omega ) , \mathbb { C } ) \simeq H ^ 1 ( M , \Sigma ( \omega _ 0 ) , \mathbb { C } ) </m> , is a local homeomorphism .

let <m> V </m> and <m> W </m> be two complex vector spaces with an action of a finite group <m> G </m> . the <m> G </m> - equivariant polynomial maps from <m> V </m> to <m> W </m> are finitely generated as a module over the ring of <m> G </m> - invariant polynomials on <m> V </m> . in other words , there exist <m> G </m> - equivariant polynomial maps <m> p _ 1 , \dotsc , p _ n </m> so that any <m> G </m> - equivariant polynomial map may be written as <m> q _ 1 p _ 1 + \dotsb + q _ n p _ n </m> where the <m> q _ i </m> are <m> G </m> - invariant polynomials on <m> V </m> . is it true that the <m> G </m> - equivariant holomorphic maps <m> V \longrightarrow W </m> are finitely generated as a module over the ring of <m> G </m> - invariant holomorphic functions on <m> V </m> , and that the generators may be taken as <m> G </m> - equivariant polynomial maps ? in other words , may we also write any <m> G </m> - equivariant holomorphic map as <m> f _ 1 p _ 1 + \dotsb + f _ n p _ n </m> where the <m> f _ i </m> are now <m> G </m> - invariant holomorphic functions ?
let <m> X \subset \mathbf { P } ^ 4 </m> be a complex threefold hypersurface with isolated singularities . we denote as usual by <m> \textrm { C l } ( X ) </m> the group of weil divisors modulo linear equivalence and by <m> \textrm { P i c } ( X ) </m> the group of cartier divisors modulo linear equivalence . we also write <m> G ( X ) : = \textrm { C l } ( X ) / \textrm { P i c } ( X ) </m> . recall that <m> \bullet </m> <m> X </m> is called factorial if every weil divisor is a cartier divisor ; by lefschetz theorem , this is equivalent to say that <m> \textrm { P i c } ( X ) = \textrm { C l } ( X ) = \mathbf { Z } </m> , generated by the hyperplane section ; <m> \bullet </m> <m> X </m> is called <m> \mathbf { Q } </m> - factorial if every weil divisor has a multiple which is a cartier divisor ; this is equivalent to say that <m> G ( X ) </m> is a torsion group . of course if <m> X </m> factorial then <m> X </m> is <m> \mathbf { Q } </m> - factorial , because if <m> X </m> is factorial then <m> G ( X ) = 0 </m> . i 'm interested in the other implication , so my first question is

i 'm currently reading bourgain and demeter 's study guide for the <m> l ^ 2 </m> decoupling theorem -LRB- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06032.pdf -RRB- . i have some trouble with understanding the proof of proposition 8.4 . let me describe the setting . we define the truncated paraboloid <m> \mathbb { P } ^ { n - 1 } = \{ ( \xi _ 1 , \dotsc , \xi _ { n - 1 } , \xi _ 1 ^ 2 + \dotsc + \xi _ { n - 1 } ^ 2 ) : 0 \leq \xi _ i \leq 1 \} </m> and the <m> \delta </m> - neighborhood of <m> \mathbb { P } ^ { n - 1 } </m> above some set <m> U \subset [ 0 , 1 ] ^ { n - 1 } </m> <m> N _ \delta ( U ) = \{ ( \xi _ 1 , \dotsc , \xi _ { n - 1 } , \xi _ 1 ^ 2 + \dotsc + \xi _ { n - 1 } ^ 2 + t ) : ( \xi _ 1 , \dotsc , \xi _ { n - 1 } ) \in U , 0 \leq t \leq \delta \} . </m> let us now restrict ourselves to <m> n = 3 </m> dimensions . let <m> L </m> be the line in the <m> ( \xi _ 1 , \xi _ 2 ) </m> - plane given by <m> \eta = 0 </m> -LRB- actually the authors choose <m> \eta = 1 </m> but this should n't change anything due to translation invariance -RRB- and let <m> S _ L = \{ ( \xi _ 1 , \xi _ 2 ) \in [ 0 , 1 ] ^ 2 : \text { d i s t } ( ( \xi _ 1 , \xi _ 2 ) , L ) < \frac { C } { K } \} </m> be the fattened line for some constant <m> C > 0 </m> . next , for a function <m> g : [ 0 , 1 ] ^ 2 \rightarrow \mathbb { C } </m> we define the extension operator <m> E _ { S _ L } g ( x , y , z ) = \int _ { S _ L } g ( \xi _ 1 , \xi _ 2 ) e ( \xi _ 1 x + \xi _ 2 y + ( \xi _ 1 ^ 2 + \xi _ 2 ^ 2 ) z ) d ( \xi _ 1 , \xi _ 2 ) </m> where <m> e ( z ) = e ^ { 2 \pi i z } </m> , which extends <m> g </m> to <m> \mathbb { P } ^ 2 </m> . now we fix some <m> y \in \mathbb { R } </m> and define the restricted operator <m> E _ { S _ L , y } g ( x , z ) : = E _ { S _ L } g ( x , y , z ) . </m> so now we are in two dimensions . the issue i have trouble with is the following : in order to obtain a decoupling inequality the authors claim that one can apply thm . 5.1 to <m> E _ { S _ L , y } g </m> which requires <m> E _ { S _ L , y } g </m> being fourier supported in <m> N _ { C / K } ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) </m> for some constant <m> C </m> . their argument why this works is , because <m> E _ { S _ L , y } g </m> is supported in the <m> O ( K ^ { - 1 } ) </m> neighborhood of the parabola <m> \eta = \xi ^ 2 </m> . but <m> N _ { C / K } ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) </m> is a strict subset of this neighborhood , so this argument is not sufficient to apply thm . 5.1 . so to be precise , my question is the following : how can one show , that <m> E _ { S _ L , y } g </m> has fourier support in <m> N _ { C / K } ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) </m> ? by the uncertainty principle this is quite clear to me , but i do n't know how to make this rigorous . my approach follows the standard ideas : instead of <m> E _ { S _ L , y } g </m> i consider <m> \phi E _ { S _ L , y } g </m> for some schwartz function <m> \phi </m> which is fourier supported in the cube <m> B ( 0 , 1 / K ) </m> centered at the origin and with side length <m> 1 / K </m> . i deduce that <m> \phi E _ { S _ L , y } g </m> is fourier supported in the <m> O ( K ^ { - 1 } ) </m> neighborhood of the parabola <m> \eta = \xi ^ 2 </m> . and now i would like to apply thm 5.1 to <m> \phi E _ { S _ L , y } g </m> , which i ca n't because of the reason discussed above . any help is appreciated . thanks in advance .

one very handy -LRB- counter -RRB- example i often think about is the scheme <m> S p e c ( k [ a , b , c ] / ( a b - c ^ 2 ) ) </m> -LRB- where <m> k </m> is a field -RRB- , which you may also know as <m> S p e c ( k [ x ^ 2 , x y , y ^ 2 ] ) </m> , as <m> \mathbb A ^ 2 / \mu _ 2 </m> , or as the <m> A _ 1 </m> singularity . as with other -LRB- counter -RRB- examples , i 'd like to be able to say as much as possible about it . there is a finite surjection <m> f : \mathbb A ^ 2 \to S p e c ( k [ x ^ 2 , x y , y ^ 2 ] ) </m> corresponding to the inclusion <m> k [ x ^ 2 , x y , y ^ 2 ] \subseteq k [ x , y ] </m> . the question is whether this surjection is in some sense universal .
i believe that anyone who can answer this question knows the terminology , but <m> \beta \omega </m> is the Čech-stone compactification of the integers and a point <m> p </m> is a weak p-point in a space <m> X </m> iff it is not in the closure of any countable subset of <m> X - \{ p \} </m> . i admit to lacking intuition with <m> \beta \omega </m> and maybe this question has a trivial answer , apologies if it is the case . my motivation is the following . i want to find a countably compact space <m> X </m> and a surjective map <m> f : X \to [ 0 , 1 ] </m> such that <m> f ( C ) \not = [ 0 , 1 ] </m> if <m> C \subset X </m> is compact . there might be a simple example that escaped me , but if the question in the title has a positive answer , taking <m> X </m> to be <m> \beta \omega </m> minus its weak p-points yields such a space : - it is countably compact because <m> \beta \omega </m> is compact , hence any countable subset has a cluster point which can not be a weak p-point , - it maps onto <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> because we may map <m> \omega </m> onto the rational numbers in <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> and extend the function to all of <m> \beta \omega </m> . the image of <m> X </m> is countably compact , hence compact in <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> and is thus all of <m> [ 0 , 1 ] </m> . - if <m> f ( E ) = [ 0 , 1 ] </m> with <m> E \subset X </m> , <m> E </m> has cardinality <m> \mathfrak { c } </m> and its closure non-compact . but maybe i am trying to kill a mosquito with an atomic bomb and a much simpler example exists .

let <m> X </m> , <m> Y </m> be normed spaces , <m> T : X \to Y </m> be a bounded linear operator . denote the open and closed unit balls by <m> B _ X : = \{ x \in X \ | \ \| x \| < 1 \} \, \overline { B _ X } : = \{ x \in X \ | \ \| x \| \le 1 \} </m> and similarly for <m> B _ Y , \overline { B _ Y } </m> . it is not hard to show that <m> \overline { B _ Y } \subset T ( \overline { B _ X } ) \implies B _ Y \subset T ( B _ X ) </m> . however the converse is false . indeed , consider the counter example <m> X = l ^ 1 ( \Bbb N ) , Y = \Bbb R </m> and <m> T ( x _ 1 , x _ 2 , x _ 3 , \dots ) : = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \frac { n x _ n } { n + 1 } . </m>
let <m> \mathbb { Z } _ n </m> denote the ring of the <m> n </m> - adic integers . i recently read a paper which used the fact that the baumslag-solitar groups bs -LRB- <m> \pm </m> 1 , n -RRB- and bs -LRB- n , <m> \pm </m> 1 -RRB- can be realized as functions <m> \mathbb { Z } _ n \rightarrow \mathbb { Z } _ n </m> . can bs -LRB- m , n -RRB- -LRB- for m and n arbitrary -RRB- be realized as a group of functions <m> \mathbb { Z } _ r \rightarrow \mathbb { Z } _ r </m> for some <m> r </m> ? thanks !
is there a simple and explicit continuous function <m> f \colon [ 0 , \infty ) ^ 2 \to \mathbb C </m> such that <m> f </m> is analytic on <m> ( 0 , \infty ) ^ 2 </m> and <m> | f ( x + i y ) | / ( x + y ) \to 1 </m> as <m> x + y \to \infty </m> , where <m> ( x , y ) \in [ 0 , \infty ) ^ 2 </m> ? it seems not too hard to construct such a function <m> f </m> as the sum of a series of polynomials , as is done in the proof of the carleman approximation theorem ; cf. -LSB- 1 -RSB- , -LSB- 2 -RSB- . however , that construction is far from explicit .
consider one of the simplest non-abelian examples of modularity . let <m> \eta ( 6 z ) \eta ( 1 8 z ) = q \prod _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty ( 1 - q ^ { 6 n } ) ( 1 - q ^ { 1 8 n } ) = q - q ^ 7 - q ^ { 1 3 } - q ^ { 1 9 } + q ^ { 2 5 } + 2 q ^ { 3 1 } - q ^ { 3 7 } + 2 q ^ { 4 3 } - q ^ { 6 1 } - q ^ { 6 7 } - q ^ { 7 3 } - q ^ { 7 9 } + q ^ { 9 1 } - q ^ { 9 7 } - q ^ { 1 0 3 } \dots = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ \infty a _ n q ^ n </m> then <m> a _ p + 1 = </m> the number of solutions of <m> \{ x ^ 3 - 2 = 0 \} </m> in <m> \mathbb { Z } / p \mathbb { Z } </m> , for prime <m> p > 3 </m> . 1 -RRB- what might be the best method to prove this ? 2 -RRB- is it possible to prove it without knowledge of modular forms ? i.e. without using the dimension / basis of the relevant space of moduli forms of some weight and level and nebentypus . for example , can it be explained using weyl -- kac character formula etc. ? 3 -RRB- unfortunately lmfdb does not yet have a list of weight <m> 1 </m> modular forms and their corresponding artin representations . where can we find more of such weight <m> 1 </m> examples ?
consider a smooth , connected and complete riemannian manifold <m> M </m> . it is well known that harmonic functions defined on some open subset of <m> M </m> are <m> C ^ \infty </m> . i 'm interested in knowing whether there are quantitative <m> C ^ 1 </m> estimates for such harmonic functions which depend only on some bound from below on the curvature -LRB- either sectional or ricci -RRB- and an upper bound on the dimension . to give an example of what i mean , consider the same question with '' <m> C ^ 1 </m> '' replaced by `` lipschitz '' . it is then a classical fact of geometric analysis that lipschitz estimates follows from a lower bound on the ricci and an upper bound on the dimension , the proof being an application of the bochner inequality together with elliptic regularity theory . yet , i do n't know any result which improves such lipschitz estimate to <m> C ^ 1 </m> . i 'm interested both in positive statement -LRB- e.g. with a lower bound on the sectional there is an estimate -RRB- and in negative ones -LRB- e.g. a lower bound on the ricci is not sufficient because along a certain sequence of manifolds the <m> C ^ 1 </m> norm of properly defined harmonic functions blows-up -RRB- . the question comes from the study of non-smooth spaces arising as -LRB- measured -RRB- - gromov-hausdorff limits of manifolds with prescribed curvature bounds . basically , what i 'm trying to understand is `` how smooth '' can be functions defined on them , so that it is natural to start looking at harmonic ones . still , in fact i do n't really know how smooth harmonic functions are on riemannian manifolds , and given that any estimate on limit spaces is -LRB- more-or-less -RRB- also a quantitative estimate on the smooth ones , before trying to reinvent the wheel i 'd like to know if there are known results available in the literature . any help is appreciated , thanks .
i have a doubt in proof of lemma <m> 4 . 7 </m> of this paper .
i think the question in the title is clear . let <m> n \in \mathbb { N } </m> . it is a nice exercise to show that every prime number divides infinitely many terms of the sequence <m> 2 ^ n - n </m> . -LRB- for example take <m> n = ( p - 1 ) ^ { 2 m } , m \in \mathbb { N } </m> -RRB- i would like to show that there are infinitely many primes for which <m> 2 ^ n \equiv n \pmod { p } </m> is actually satisfied for some <m> 0 < n < p </m> which is equivalent to the question already existing in the title . any ideas ?
the classical mumford-shah image denoisng problem study the minimizer of the following functional , for each <m> \alpha > 0 </m> where <m> \Omega \subset \mathbb R ^ 2 </m> is open bounded with sommth boundary , <m> u _ \alpha : = \operatorname { a r g m i n } _ { u \in S B V ( \Omega ) } \left \{ \int _ \Omega \left | { u - u _ 0 } \right | ^ 2 d x + \alpha \left ( \int _ \Omega \left | { \nabla u } \right | ^ 2 d x + \mathcal H ^ 1 ( S _ u ) \right ) \right \} </m> where <m> u _ 0 \in S B V ( \Omega ) </m> and <m> \nabla u </m> denotes the absolute continuous part of <m> D u </m> which is the weak derivative of <m> u </m> in the sense of radon measure . <m> S _ u </m> denote the jump set of <m> u </m> . clearly , for <m> \alpha = 0 </m> , <m> u _ 0 = u _ 0 </m> , and for <m> \alpha = + \infty </m> , <m> S _ \infty </m> would be empty .
given <m> U \subset \mathbb { C } ^ n </m> , open domain , a locally flat current on <m> U </m> is a <m> k - </m> current <m> T </m> such that for every <m> f \in \mathcal { D } ( U ) </m> -LRB- smooth functions with compact support in <m> U </m> -RRB- there exist a compactly supported <m> k - </m> vectorfield <m> \xi </m> of class <m> L ^ 1 ( U , d V ) </m> and a compactly supported <m> ( k + 1 ) - </m> vectorfield <m> \eta </m> also of class <m> L ^ 1 ( U , d V ) </m> such that <m> T ( f \omega ) = \int _ { U } \langle \xi , f \omega \rangle d V + ( - 1 ) ^ { k + 1 } \int _ { U } \langle \eta , d ( f \omega ) \rangle d V </m> for every <m> \omega \in \mathcal { D } ^ k ( U ) </m> . in other words , <m> T = \xi \llcorner d V + b ( \eta \llcorner d V ) </m> , where <m> b </m> is the boundary operator between currents . the flat currents are obviously stable under <m> b </m> : if <m> T </m> is locally flat , then <m> b T </m> is too . i would like to know if there is a subclass of flat currents which is stable under the <m> \overline { \partial } </m> operator or , which is the same , stable under <m> b </m> and under taking <m> ( p , q ) - </m> components . the class of currents associated with <m> \mathcal { C } ^ \infty </m> vectorfields obviously works , but i would be interested in larger classes . the `` obvious '' idea <m> \xi + \overline { \partial } \eta </m> does not work as , for example , <m> \overline { \partial } \left ( z ^ { - 1 } \frac { \partial } { \partial z } \wedge \frac { \partial } { \partial \bar { z } } \right ) = \delta _ 0 \frac { \partial } { \partial z } </m> and this is n't flat . remark an idea only a little less obvious works , but it is still not satisfactory for me : denote by <m> W _ { p , q } ( U ) </m> the set of <m> ( p , q ) - </m> vectorfields <m> \xi </m> which are in <m> L ^ 1 ( U , d V ) </m> and such that <m> \overline { \partial } \mathrm { i v } \xi </m> belongs to <m> L ^ 1 ( U , d V ) </m> as well -LRB- here <m> \overline { \partial } \mathrm { i v } </m> is the <m> ( p , q - 1 ) - </m> component of the divergence -RRB- ; given <m> \xi \in W _ { p , q } ( U ) </m> , the current <m> T _ \xi ( \omega ) = \int _ { U } \langle \xi , \omega \rangle d V </m> is such that <m> \overline { \partial } T </m> is associated to <m> \overline { \partial } \mathrm { i v } \xi </m> , which is obviously in <m> L ^ 1 ( U , d V ) </m> , but then for every current we know that <m> \overline { \partial } \overline { \partial } T = 0 </m> ; this means that the current <m> S = \overline { \partial } T </m> is in <m> L ^ 1 ( U , d V ) </m> and also <m> \overline { \partial } S </m> is -LRB- because the latter is <m> 0 </m> -RRB- . why is this not satisfactory ? well , this works for the <m> \overline { \partial } </m> , but not for a decomposition in <m> ( p , q ) - </m> components -LRB- if we define <m> W _ k ( U ) </m> in the same way , it does not hold that <m> W _ k = \bigoplus W _ { p , q } </m> -RRB- ; moreover , i would like to see if there exists a larger class , inside flat currents , stable under <m> \overline { \partial } </m> .

recall that the <m> k </m> - core of a graph <m> G </m> is the unique maximal subgraph of <m> G </m> with minimum degree at least <m> k </m> . in an erdos-renyi random graph , where the edge selection is independent with probability is <m> p </m> , we have the following inequalities : <m>  </m> g <m> c o n t a i n s a t l e a s t o n e </m> k <m>  </m> and <m>  </m> g <m> h a s a n o n e m p t y </m> k <m>  </m> where <m> Q = \sum _ { i = k } ^ { m - 1 } \dbinom { m - 1 } { i } p ^ i ( 1 - p ) ^ { m - 1 - i } </m> and <m> m </m> is the size of the <m> k </m> - core . i ca n't understand how i should compare these two probabilities to conclude which one is more probable .
take <m> k </m> consecutive composite integers from a prime gap . what is known about the largest prime divisor of their product ? it seems to me that except for the triplet <m> ( 8 , 9 , 1 0 ) </m> and the pair <m> ( 8 , 9 ) </m> , this largest prime divisor is always larger than <m> 2 k </m> , but i could not find an elementary -LRB- my level -RRB- proof . as <m> k </m> grows it seems that the sharpness of <m> 2 k </m> as lower bound is lost , therefore i expect that there should exist a more suitable lower bound , from which an `` easy '' argument for the minoration by <m> 2 k </m> would follow . the question is essentially the same as this one from mse but it did not get any answer . i could only find messy <m> k </m> - specific arguments for <m> k </m> up to <m> 4 </m> which i hope are correct .

i 'm trying to figure out/find in literature the details concerning gelfand-tsetlin algebras for <m> \mathfrak { g l } _ n ( \mathbb C ) </m> -LRB- okounkov-vershik style , if you wish -RRB- . consider the chain <m> \mathcal U ( \mathfrak { g l } _ 1 ) \subset \ldots \subset \mathcal U ( \mathfrak { g l } _ n ) , </m> denote the centers <m> Z _ i \subset \mathcal U ( \mathfrak { g l } _ i ) </m> and define the commutative algebra <m> G T _ n = \langle Z _ 1 , \ldots , Z _ n \rangle . </m> one sees that elements of <m> G T _ n </m> act diagonally in the gelfand-tsetlin basis in any finite-dimensional irrep of <m> \mathfrak { g l } _ n </m> . beyond that little is clear to me . it 'd be great if someone could provide an answer or reference for any of the following . -LRB- of course , 3 -RRB- is the key question here . -RRB- 1 -RRB- is <m> G T _ n </m> precisely the subalgebra of <m> \mathcal U ( \mathfrak { g l } _ n ) </m> acting diagonally in any gt basis ? is it a maximal commutative subalgebra ? 2 -RRB- is the centralizer <m> Z ( \mathcal U ( \mathfrak { g l } _ n ) , \mathcal U ( \mathfrak { g l } _ { n - 1 } ) ) </m> commutative ? do we have <m> Z ( \mathcal U ( \mathfrak { g l } _ n ) , \mathcal U ( \mathfrak { g l } _ { n - 1 } ) ) = \langle Z _ { n - 1 } , Z _ n \rangle ? </m> 3 -RRB- are there generators of <m> G T _ n </m> analogous in some way to the jucys-murphy elements ? how do they act on an element of a gt basis in terms of the corresponding gt pattern -LRB- or ssyt -RRB- ? 4 -RRB- is <m> G T _ n </m> at all the natural object to consider here ?
does there exist an uncountable <m> P \subset \mathcal { P } ( \mathbb { N } ) </m> with the property that for any distinct <m> x , y \in P </m> , <m> | x \cap y | </m> is prime ? a more general , but likely harder , question : is it possible to characterize the set <m> \mathcal { A } </m> of all subsets <m> S \subset \mathbb { N } </m> with the following property : there is some uncountable <m> P \subset \mathcal { P } ( \mathbb { N } ) </m> such that for all distinct <m> x , y \in P </m> , <m> | x \cap y | \in S </m> . it 's easy to show no <m> S </m> finite belongs to <m> \mathcal { A } </m> . it 's also not hard to show every <m> \text { m o d } \ m </m> equivalence class , belongs to <m> \mathcal { A } </m> . one reasonable sounding idea is that this is related to the asymptotic density of <m> S </m> in <m> \mathbb { N } </m> .

ordinary -LRB- connective -RRB- complex <m> K </m> - theory is the algebraic <m> K </m> theory of the topological ring <m> \mathbb { C } </m> with analytic topology . one can also study the <m> K </m> theory of <m> \mathbb { C } </m> with discrete topology . weibel , in his <m> K </m> - theory book , computes the torsion in its coefficient ring . i would like to know the torsion-free part in the homotopy groups , but ca n't find this anywhere . the best language for this might be in terms of motives -LRB- without factoring out <m> \mathbb { A } ^ 1 </m> -RRB- , but i do n't know where to find its homotopy groups computed in this language either . anyone know this ?
given <m> d , B > 0 </m> the number of polynomials in <m> \mathbb Z [ x ] </m> of degree <m> d </m> and coefficient size at most <m> B </m> have at least one integer roots should be <m> B ^ { O ( d ) } f ( d ) </m> at some function <m> f </m> -LRB- from random diophantine polynomials : percent solvable ? -RRB- . so the probability that a uniformly random polynomial in <m> \mathbb Z [ x ] </m> of degree <m> d </m> and coefficient size at most <m> B </m> has at least one integer root is <m> \frac { B ^ { O ( d ) } f ( d ) } { ( 2 B + 1 ) ^ { d + 1 } } \asymp \frac { f ( d ) } { 2 B + 1 } </m> which is close to <m> 0 </m> .

in the general case , i want to say that determining <m> | H o m ( G , H ) | </m> is incomputable , arguing that you could use the number to test for simplicity of a presentation , but i am new to this area and i keep finding flaws with my argument . while i believe the general case is incomputable , there are computable special cases . one in particular that interests me is : compute <m> | H o m ( \pi ( S ) , G ) | </m> for the fundamental group of a surface <m> S </m> , given by a triangulation , and <m> G </m> finite . this arises in mednykh 's formula for a 2d tlft invariant -LRB- <m> | G | ^ { \chi ( S ) - 1 } | H o m ( \pi ( S ) , G ) | </m> -RRB- , which one can approximate -LRB- details in a paper to appear by gorjan alagic and myself -RRB- efficiently on a quantum computer . however , i have been unable to find any information on the classical complexity of finding <m> | H o m ( \pi ( S ) , G ) | </m> -LRB- with <m> \pi ( S ) , G </m> given in any way -RRB- to contrast with the quantum case , or even a discussion of when <m> | H o m ( G , H ) | </m> is computable and what the complexity of computing it should be . so , that leaves me with the possibly too broad :
let <m> S </m> be the spectrum of a discrete valuation ring and <m> f : X \rightarrow S </m> be a relative projective curve with generic fiber smooth and special fiber semistable . how much differ the sheaf <m> R ^ 2 f _ { \operatorname { e t } , * } \mathbb { G } _ m </m> -LRB- computed in the étale topology -RRB- from <m> R ^ 2 f _ { \operatorname { Z a r } , * } \mathbb { G } _ m </m> -LRB- computed in the zariski topology , this is zero -RRB- ? if they are not the same is there a condition on <m> f </m> to ensure that they coincide ?
the elements of a regular sequence in <m> k [ x _ 1 , \ldots , x _ n ] </m> are algebraically independent over <m> k </m> -LRB- see for example matsumura ex . 16.6 -RRB- , and so for a length n regular sequence <m> ( f _ i ) </m> of homogeneous elements , <m> k ( x _ 1 , \ldots , x _ n ) </m> will be algebraic over <m> k ( f _ 1 , \ldots , f _ n ) </m> . my question is whether it 's also true that <m> k [ x _ 1 , \ldots , x _ n ] </m> is integral over <m> k [ f _ 1 , \ldots , f _ n ] </m> . aside from experimental evidence -LRB- dozens of randomly generated regular sequences in macaulay with n = 3 and low-ish degrees -RRB- , i do n't really have any reason to think that it should be true , and i have n't been able to prove or disprove it -LRB- or find a mention of it anywhere -RRB- . thanks . edit : added homogeneous condition
the longest word in type <m> A _ 3 </m> weyl group written as a matrix is <m> w _ 0 = s _ 1 s _ 2 s _ 1 = \left ( \begin {array} { c c c c } 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end {array} \right ) . </m> what is the longest word in type <m> C _ 2 </m> weyl group written in terms of a matrix ? in this case , <m> w _ 0 = s _ 1 s _ 2 s _ 1 s _ 2 </m> . how to write <m> s _ 1 , s _ 2 </m> as matrices ? thank you very much .
let <m> U = \cup _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } U ( n ) </m> be endowed with the weak topology , let <m> B U </m> be its classifying space . then for any compact cw complex <m> X </m> , <m> [ X , B U ] </m> classifies all the vector bundles on <m> X </m> up to stable isomorphisms , which is in one-one correspondence with <m> \tilde { K } ( X ) </m> . on the other hand , let <m> \mathrm { F r e d } _ 0 ( H ) </m> be the set of zero-index fredholm operators of a given hilbert space <m> H </m> -LRB- with the strong topology -RRB- , then <m> \tilde { K } ( X ) \cong [ X , \textrm { F r e d } _ 0 ( H ) ] </m> . since all these correspondences are natural with respect to <m> X </m> , it is reasonable to expect a connection between these two spaces . what is the relationship between them ? thanks a lot .
let m be a complete , n dimensional riemannian manifold without boundary . suppose <m> g _ 1 , g _ 2 </m> are two metrics on m and <m> g _ 1 \leqslant g _ 2 </m> . suppose that there exists <m> T > 0 </m> such that for <m> i = 1 , 2 </m> , the ricci flow <m> \frac { \partial g } { \partial t } = - 2 R i c </m> with initial condition <m> g ( 0 ) = g _ i </m> exist for <m> t \in [ 0 , T ] </m> . do we have <m> g _ 1 ( t ) \leqslant g _ 2 ( t ) </m> for <m> t \in ( 0 , T ] </m> ? when n = 2 , the metric can be written in the conformal coordinates <m> g _ i ( t ) = e ^ { 2 u _ i ( t ) } ( d r ^ 2 + r ^ 2 d \theta ^ 2 ) . </m> <m> u _ i ( t ) </m> satisfies the parabolic equation <m> \frac { \partial u _ i } { \partial t } = e ^ { - 2 u _ i } \Delta u _ i = - K _ i </m> where <m> K _ i </m> are the gauss curvature . we have <m> u _ 1 ( 0 ) \leqslant u _ 2 ( 0 ) </m> , we need to prove <m> u _ 1 ( t ) \leqslant u _ 2 ( t ) </m> . let <m> v ( t ) = \min _ { x \in \mathbb { R } ^ 2 } u _ 2 ( t , x ) - u _ 1 ( t , x ) </m> , suppose the minimum are attained at <m> x _ t </m> , then <m> \Delta ( u _ 2 - u _ 1 ) | _ { x _ t } \leqslant 0 </m> and thus <m> \frac { \partial v } { \partial t } \leqslant ( e ^ { - 2 u _ 2 } - e ^ { - 2 u _ 1 } ) \Delta u _ 1 | _ { x _ t } . </m> it seems that we ca n't expect that <m> \frac { \partial v } { \partial t } \leqslant 0 </m> . so how can we prove <m> u _ 1 ( t ) \leqslant u _ 2 ( t ) </m> ?
i am reading the book `` lie superalgebras and enveloping algebras '' by ian m. musson . the strange type <m> P ( n ) </m> series of lie superalgebras are defined -LRB- § 2.4.1 , p. 17 -RRB- only for <m> n \ge 2 </m> even though for <m> n = 1 </m> the definition makes perfect sense . my question is , <m> n = 1 </m> case is not considered because this lie superalgebra is actually belonged to earlier defined types and so in ordered to avoid overcounting ? or <m> P ( 1 ) </m> is not simple ? -LRB- in this case , is it easy to find the ideal ? -RRB- thanks for your time .

let <m> f : X \rightarrow X ' </m> be a morphism of schemes , and let <m> \mathcal { I } ^ { \bullet } </m> be a complex of <m> \mathcal { O } _ X </m> - modules . there are two spectral sequences -LRB- well , more than that , but these are the two i care about -RRB- abutting to the hypercohomology <m> \mathbb { H } ^ n ( X , \mathcal { I } ^ { \bullet } ) </m> . the first is the second spectral sequence of hypercohomology , which has <m> E _ 2 </m> - term <m> E _ 2 ^ { p , q } = H ^ p ( X , H ^ q ( \mathcal { I } ^ { \bullet } ) ) </m> -LRB- where <m> H ^ q ( \mathcal { I } ^ { \bullet } ) </m> just means the <m> q ^ { t h } </m> cohomology object of the complex <m> \mathcal { I } ^ { \bullet } </m> -RRB- and the second is the leray spectral sequence associated with <m> f </m> , which has <m> E _ 2 </m> - term <m> E _ 2 ^ { p , q } = H ^ p ( X ' , R ^ q f _ * \mathcal { I } ^ { \bullet } ) </m> -LRB- here , since the terms in the spectral sequence are <m> \Gamma ( X ' , \mathcal { O } _ { X ' } ) </m> - modules , the abutment <m> \mathbb { H } ^ n ( X , \mathcal { I } ^ { \bullet } ) </m> must be viewed as a <m> \Gamma ( X ' , \mathcal { O } _ { X ' } ) </m> - module by restricting scalars . -RRB- are there conditions on <m> X , X ' , f </m> , and/or <m> \mathcal { I } ^ { \bullet } </m> under which we can say that these <m> E _ 2 </m> - terms are the same , that is , that <m> H ^ p ( X , H ^ q ( \mathcal { I } ^ { \bullet } ) ) \simeq H ^ p ( X ' , R ^ q f _ * \mathcal { I } ^ { \bullet } ) </m> as <m> \Gamma ( X ' , \mathcal { O } _ { X ' } ) </m> - modules . in this -LRB- non-degenerate -RRB- case , it 's not really a spectral sequence question at all , but a question of somehow comparing two iterated cohomology objects . in the case i care about , in which i suspect for other reasons that there will be such an isomorphism but the spectral sequences will almost surely not degenerate at <m> E _ 2 </m> , there are lots of nice properties that can be assumed : <m> X </m> and <m> X ' </m> are smooth and projective over a field , <m> f </m> is smooth and projective -LRB- hence , in particular , proper and flat -RRB- , and the complex <m> \mathcal { I } ^ { \bullet } </m> is a complex of injective <m> \mathcal { O } _ X </m> - modules -LRB- but not , however , an injective resolution of any single <m> \mathcal { O } _ X </m> - module -RRB- . -LRB- edited 7/2 : as karl schwede points out , even if both degenerate at the <m> E _ 2 </m> - term there 's no reason to assume all the terms are the same . -RRB-
this question is motivated by this problem of dominic van der zypen . problem . let <m> X = \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ n X _ i </m> be the tychonoff product of linearly ordered compact hausdorff spaces <m> X _ 1 , \dots , X _ n </m> . is it true that each subspace <m> Y \subset X </m> has large inductive dimension <m> \mathrm { I n d } ( Y ) \le n </m> and the covering dimension <m> \mathrm { d i m } ( Y ) \le n </m> ? remark 1 . by induction it can be shown that each subspace <m> Y </m> of <m> X </m> has small inductive dimension <m> \mathrm { i n d } ( Y ) \le n </m> .
denote by <m> \Omega ^ 2 ( { S } ^ 2 ) </m> the space of dotted maps from the <m> 2 - </m> sphere <m> S ^ 2 </m> onto itself . and consider its free loop space <m> X = \mathcal { L } ( \Omega ^ 2 ( { S } ^ 2 ) ) = M a p s ( S ^ 1 , \Omega ^ 2 ( { S } ^ 2 ) ) </m> . i think that <m> \pi _ 0 ( X ) </m> is <m> \pi _ 3 ( S ^ 2 ) \oplus \pi _ 2 ( S ^ 2 ) </m> where the integer in <m> \pi _ 2 ( S ^ 2 ) </m> measures the degree of the map <m> \{ \cdot \} \times S ^ 2 \to S ^ 2 </m> , <m> \{ \cdot \} \in S ^ 1 </m> . but i need to know the geometric meaning of the term in <m> \pi _ 3 ( S ^ 2 ) </m> there ; i.e. if a given element has zero the element in <m> \pi _ 2 ( S ^ 2 ) </m> , how do we recognize visually or geometrically the other integer ? thanks in advance

i am interested in the question of the classification of -LRB- low rank -RRB- gorenstein rings over <m> \mathbb { C } </m> . the socle of a local algebra is the annihilator of its maximal ideal . a commutative local ring is called gorenstein iff its socle is 1-dimensional . here , `` rank '' means the dimension of the algebra as a vector space . a classification of low rank -LRB- < 7 -RRB- algebra can be found in http://math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/dimension6.pdf and so do the gorenstein rings . but i did n't find further results . is there any reference ?

i have looked through all my standard algebraic geometry texts and tried many tricks using zariski 's main theorem and noether normalization , but remain stuck by the following : let <m> \pi : X \to S </m> be a morphism of finite type between integral , noetherian schemes and let <m> x </m> be a point of <m> X </m> . does there exist an open neighbourhood of <m> X </m> which admits a finite , surjective morphism onto a smooth <m> S </m> - scheme ? in this generality i think that the answer is ` no ' , though i do not have a counterexample . what if we impose additional assumptions such as <m> \pi </m> being flat or proper -LRB- or even projective -RRB- ? a related question , an affirmative answer to which would imply the same for the previous question in the projective case , is the following : if <m> X </m> is a projective scheme over a local ring <m> A </m> , then does <m> X </m> admit a finite surjection to <m> \mathbb { P } _ A ^ d </m> for some <m> d \ge 1 </m> ? -LRB- i am imagining that <m> A = \mathbb { Z } _ p </m> , so please do not assume that the residue field of <m> A </m> is infinite ! -RRB- thank you !

consider the unit sphere <m> S ^ 2 = \left \{ x \in \mathbb { R } ^ 3 ~ { \large | } ~ | x | = 1 \right \} </m> and denote the uniform -LRB- lebesgue -RRB- measures on the <m> S ^ 2 </m> and <m> [ 0 , 1 ] ^ 2 </m> by <m> m _ S </m> and <m> m _ 2 </m> , respectively . question 1 : is there a map <m> \phi : [ 0 , 1 ] ^ 2 \to S ^ 2 </m> such that preserves the uniform measure , i.e. , -LRB- with a slight abuse of notation -RRB- <m> \phi \circ m _ 2 = m _ S \circ \phi </m> ? question 2 : is there a way to construct coordinates on <m> ( \varphi _ 1 ( w ) , \varphi _ 2 ( z ) ) : [ 0 , 1 ] ^ 2 \to S ^ 2 </m> such that <m> d m _ S ( \varphi _ 1 ( w ) , \varphi _ 2 ( z ) ) = d w \, d z </m> ? question 3 : does such coordinates exist for every higher dimensions ? remark : on <m> S ^ 1 </m> , this is trivial by <m> \varphi ( t ) = e ^ { 2 \pi i t } </m> , up to a constant .

in -LRB- mathematical -RRB- physics in order to compute path integrals one often makes an infinite dimensional change of variables and uses infinite jacobian as a purely formal expression . this step is done in formal analogy with the finite dimensional case -LRB- e.g. in the faddeev-popov construction -RRB- . next one often needs to compute this jacobian . in some situations it is a `` determinant '' of a self-adjoint elliptic differential operator on a compact manifold . a conventional procedure to compute it is to use the <m> \zeta </m> - function regularization . this procedure seems to me to be quite arbitrary . while i am not an expert , i have never seen in literature any motivation of it except that it gives the right answer for finite dimensional transformations . to compare with , in classical analysis there are many different methods to sum divergent series , but they may lead to different answers . questions . 1 -RRB- are there other conventional methods which are used in explicit computations of infinite jacobians ? 2 -RRB- are there any nice pleausible general properties of the <m> \zeta </m> - function regularized determinants which distingush them from other methods ? added : this method leads to the identity mentioned in the answer below by zurab silagadze <m> 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \dots = - \frac { 1 } { 1 2 } </m> which seems to me completely counter-intuitive .

in -LSB- fsit -RSB- and -LSB- oimt -RSB- it is claimed that there is a surjection from <m> P ( \kappa ) \cap J ^ { \vec E } _ { \nu ( E _ \alpha ) } \times [ \nu ( E _ \alpha ) ] ^ { < \omega } </m> onto <m> \alpha </m> , and that this surjection lies in <m> J _ { \alpha + 1 } ^ { \vec E } </m> . it is stated as a rather trivial fact , but i 'm having trouble with seeing how this map should look like . here <m> \nu ( E _ \alpha ) </m> is the natural length of the <m> ( \kappa , \alpha ) </m> pre-extender <m> E _ \alpha </m> and <m> \vec E </m> is a fine extender sequence , the definition of which can be found in -LSB- oimt -RSB- at page 11 . since <m> E _ \alpha </m> is the trivial completion of <m> E _ \alpha \upharpoonright \nu ( E _ \alpha ) </m> i can see that <m> \nu ( E _ \alpha ) </m> somehow `` carries enough information '' to determine <m> \alpha </m> , but this vague analogy just does n't give me anything concrete . of course , if a given surjection is found and is shown to be definable over <m> J _ \alpha ^ { \vec E } </m> , then it 's in <m> J _ { \alpha + 1 } ^ { \vec E } </m> . thanks in advance !
i am trying to show that there can not be any nonvanishing killing vector fields on a compact <m> G _ 2 </m> manifold . for the definition of a <m> G _ 2 </m> manifold just see the wikipedia page . i know that since the manifold is ricci-flat , any killing vector field must be a parallel vector field , but i am unsure how to prove that these can not be nonvanishing . i have read a lot of things in the literature about betti numbers . for example the article `` the structure of compact ricci-flat riemannian manifolds '' by fischer and wolf . but it 's pretty over my head . how should i go about this problem ? should i continue to learn more about the betti numbers of compact <m> G _ 2 </m> manifolds or is there a more simple -LRB- maybe even obvious -RRB- thing that i am missing ?
